Aegisth,this picture gave me a pause because it pretty accurately hits on how i felt when depressed ,2,creepy
Aegisth,there been some very close calls ,7,dndnext
Aegisth,the meaning of the headline is not comey should be held responsible for the actions of your employees tomorrow due to his testimony the meaning is comey testimony tomorrow is so important that your employees may not be as focused in their work as they may be and we are mentioning this to point out how important the testimony is normally no one would care about a federal hearing however this hearing is potentially so important that even those who normally do not care are willing to shirk their responsibilites to make sure they are aware of the developing situation you are getting downvoted because the meaning is inherently clear to most people and your anger shows that you simply do not understand the meaning behind the words people will react similarly if you respond to someone sarcastic remark as if they were serious it shows you have a lack of understanding of the subtleties of a conversation ,1,politics
Aegisth,no you are just missing the very obvious point ,1,politics
Aegisth,what time is it at where can i watch it online ,1,politics
Aegisth,at this point your ruling is homebrew rai obviously does not need that ,4,dndnext
Aegisth,uh since crits are a lot less common than a normal hit the greatsword has a greater average damage even taking crits into account why would i take one extra damage on average during crits when i can take one extra damage on each hit ,3,dndnext
Aegisth,unless you value better average damage than more common max damage ,3,dndnext
Aegisth,greataxe is not a forgone conclusion for a barbarian ,5,dndnext
Aegisth,netherlands is correct year is 1695 so basically 1700 yep ,1,eu4
Aegisth,life is strange ,1,AskReddit
Aegisth,http imgur com a osnyx who am i what year and where to go next ,1,eu4
Aegisth,how ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,obviously but the level of criticism in this thread isnt appropriate,1,dndnext
Aegisth, aboleth beholders cambion dryads succubi and vampires are all capable of non incanted charm effects the average person probably thinks most of those are myths even some low level adventures probably think that how often do you think the average person runs into a friggin beholder ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,i am really unsure why you are getting so much hate here what you provided is a fantastic resource ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,because the person used no arcane incantations so the person would not suspect that magic was used on them subtle spell is not common in the world of casters and many people would not even know about it and to the person it might not seem outlandish if you make them punch their wife in the face maybe but telling you where something is and using subtle spell to work it into the rest of a conversation is far from outlandish ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,damn so much bitching and moaning in this thread for what amounts to a great free guide he does not owe you anything guys thanks for the guide it gave me a fresh look at sorcerer and helped me understand the class better for both myself and my players so i can help them with the class if they need it ,5,dndnext
Aegisth,did you even bother reading the guide there is plenty to learn here even without mention of ee or ua ignoring it because he does not tell you exactly what to do is stupid ,-1,dndnext
Aegisth,it a plothole ,-1,dbz
Aegisth,except piccolo did the same thing and it fixed for later use it not really an excuse ,-4,dbz
Aegisth,obviously it exaggerated it was not actually the fallen angel but it was her personality grafted onto dresden brain my point was more that without context seemingly impressive feats can actually be not worth much ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth, so it is an active thing from what we know yes this is seeming a lot like outside help rather than more of a trait dresden has yeah it not dresden specifically while technically outside help i do not see why dresden could not be affected by it many of the responses in this thread talk about how john can get hell to swallow up dresden which is also outside help ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, that is iffy so if the white god was killed or disappeared but his powers influence as in any magic he cast or anything he built remains we would not know if john gets the benefit of the power the white god wo not affect a mortal free will however he will affect their environment to push them in a certain direction so if the white god was killed the interference stops how powerful is the interference like whats the best thing its done for dresden best thing is difficult to say because it unclear what he has and has not done most of the things he done are small for instance he sent a knight of a cross his mortal police to help a group of wizards from being killed the knight was going to leave in his own car to drive home but the car would not start this led to the wizards inviting him to travel with the wizards who were attacked and would not have survived had the knight not been there the group then showed up at a hearing to kill a young girl that dresden would have fought to the death over therefore saving dresden life most of his actions are butterfly effect like things the white god would need to be massively more powerful than this for his protection to match up to john assuming we are allowing these haxy powers in play his powers are very vague on purpose supposed to be the christian god that the only scale we have for comparison otherwise we just have implication in the dresden universe the more people that believe in a supernatural being the more power they have almost the entirety of earth believes in the white god so he is very powerful other beings have been able to manipulate reality when they had a large amount of believers but again these things are vague within the series then i do not think he can use them if outside help is allowed he could use their imprisonment to broker help ie i will free you if you help me but that would still be outside interference i was thinking more about letting these things out to cause john a lot of trouble ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,nah when taking the chances of two independent events happening at the same time you multiply the chances together so you do 1 20 1 20 which is 1 400 ,2,dndnext
Aegisth, is it a blessing or is it the white god occasionally interferring for dresden benefit also how powerful because john power has been able to impact some of the strongest beings in the dc multiverse it hard to say we do not have a character author telling us directly we do know that the white god has directly influenced events so that dresden would not die someone would be there to back him up and what do you mean how powerful how powerful is the white god unknown we do know his archangel is a casual galaxy manipulator mab is the fey queen of the winter court and her battles have the side consequence of causing ice ages sure he can use the island itself but not the people in it unless he officially owns them he owns them as much as a warden owns his prisoners he magically owns the island it bound to him i am familiar with dresden but i cannot say i know him well same with me and john haha ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,and he straight killed fotf or outsmarted him well above universal does not mean much if john just outsmarted him ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth, destiny manipulation that actively bends reality to john benefit dresden has something similar with the white god while dresden is not a knight of the cross the white god has been shown to manipulate events in a way that helps dresden out in the end an archangel does something similar for him as well it hard to say how much the likes of mab and leah help with this too she probably does a lot in the background for dresden the house is something that john owns it is sentient but its an item thats irrevocably attached to him its no different than if a hero had a sentient gun then we can say that dresden owns the island made to imprison forgotten gods and other nasty beings as he is its rightful owner magically speaking this is a really hard to call battle i think unless someone knows both characters very well ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,dresden has outsmarted a fey queen multiple times and has taken down a fey queen in her own court at the height of her power it hard to say what going toe to toe with lucier means when we do not really know what lucifer powers are in john universe ,3,whowouldwin
Aegisth,this seems like a no limits fallacy it also dearly underestimates dresden own contacts within the supernatural realm a fey queen the creatures underneath his island hades the white god odin etc are all supernatural contacts that dresden has sway with and in some cases actually owns if you are giving other creatures to john you cannot ignore what dresden has ,4,whowouldwin
Aegisth,i mean those sound awesome but dresden has done similar things just stating things like that does not actually give us any info on john here are things dresden has done convinced a fallen angel to kill herself to save his life killed every red court vampire at once convinced odin to help him out multiple times had a friendly chat with hades because hades thinks he cool impressed a primal force of nature that he was such a bad ass mortal that she waited years to make him the winter knight killed a queen of the fey in her domain at the height of her power now saying all of it like that makes dresden seem god level because i have taken away context ,4,whowouldwin
Aegisth,can you give some examples of john trinkets dresden is no slouch in the prep feel himself ,3,whowouldwin
Aegisth,i personally try and go by the most conservative news sources approval pollings those are the upper bound in my mind so i go off that ,1,politics
Aegisth, damn man im so sorry this hit really close to home,82,AskReddit
Aegisth,at 7 months i wish i knew how strong complacency can set in ,2,stopdrinking
Aegisth, the art on such scenes however is a tad off since its a shot from far and they have to draw full proportions instead of a closeup face shot which is easier do not really think this is a valid excused other animes have been able to do this fine for decades now but it is shit we are in agreement,1,dbz
Aegisth,except the rof color scheme and art are great in my opinion everything looks amazing it shit like this scene that i hate https youtu be psum5 s6ldu t 38 look at this scene and honestly tell me you think the art looks good here the coloring and lighting are fine the art is just abysmal ,1,dbz
Aegisth,biggest thing for me is waiting as a viewer i do not want to have a blank screen as we wait for the next event keep a side stream with friendlies pools smaller events that go on all the time so the stream always have something to watch ,2,smashbros
Aegisth,except the logic error does not apply here the community already agrees on where puff is on the tier list and fox is a hell of a lot higher ,1,smashbros
Aegisth,why is trying to kill the momentum of your opponent a bad thing it not a bad strategy to do so ,1,smashbros
Aegisth,ssj3 looked fine in dbz ,10,dbz
Aegisth,you do not read what people say very well ,4,dbz
Aegisth,purposefully spoiling the show in a thread about the american dub is a dick move ,4,dbz
Aegisth, pretty gosh darn significant i love you,3,dbz
Aegisth,yeah i know i do as well i was trying to make a point to mute proxy ,3,dbz
Aegisth,welp you are a dick then it should be fucking obvious to you why people like to understand the language a character is speaking instead of reading subs they want to watch the anime in its entirety not read lines of text on a screen because anime is a visual medium you twat ,1,dbz
Aegisth,ah shit you are right i used to like the fact that he was the only earthling never to die in the series ,5,dbz
Aegisth,i do not understand your point to my comment you would think he would have used all his abilities in a fight to the death then,0,dbz
Aegisth,why would not you just read a transcript of the episode then instead of watching the episode what does it matter as long as you understand what is going on ,6,dbz
Aegisth,if he did use all of his abilities why would you question who knows what abilities he has ,6,dbz
Aegisth,you would think he would use all of them in a fight to his death ,17,dbz
Aegisth,that really dumb ,1,eu4
Aegisth,what do you mean ,4,eu4
Aegisth,even at 33 50 off spending an extra 75 154 for just dlc is still pretty crazy ,2,eu4
Aegisth,because i did not know they went on sale and did not want to wait a few months to play the game ,9,eu4
Aegisth,no ,-6,dndnext
Aegisth,well technically is not a house rule since the dm is still deciding who goes first in a tie the dm is saying that whoever has the higher dex mod goes first ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,is not this legal in adventure league ,5,dndnext
Aegisth,it super expensive to be a new player i spent 150 200 on this game when i get into it it incredibly expensive i do not mind the cost because my income allows me to do it and i already have 175 hours in it but a single game should not cost as much as a cheap console ,2,eu4
Aegisth,updated in another post decently extensive summary ,2,eu4
Aegisth,off the top of my head there a few general suggestions i think could help 1 allying england early on is my preferred approach this is a lot easier as leinster kildare or tyrone as you can usually get an alliance before you unpause for the first time this helps because you have england as an ally obviously but also because you have just taken up a diplo slot of england with other irish opm you have to deal with potentially 3 english allies on your island as one of the irish provinces that england initially already likes you have to deal with less of that noise 2 i do not take any advisors including morale of armies until after i have conquered all of ireland minus pale and any english vassals the area is simply too poor and the benefit is minimal i save my gold for marketplaces infantry or light ships once i have my force limits maxed a few high value marketplaces and know that hiring advisors will not cause my income to go negative i start hiring advisors the negative gold problem just gets worse if you do not make it a point to fix it 3 i always try to take any irish opm touching pale before outer region opm this mitigates being warned by england although it hit or miss on how often you can do so 4 taking advantage of war of the roses and the france england war over maine is super important sometimes they happen at the same time but in my experience they happen one after the other this is really the only time you will be able to deal with irish opm allies of england because england will reject the call to arms if you wait until after these events they will eventually vassalize and then annex those provinces 5 allying england instead of france lets you take out scotland easier for instance in my latest game i honored a call to arms from england against scotland i then sieged down as many provinces as i could and luckily got both lothian and ayrshire and separate peaced this broke my alliance but at this point france is willing to be my ally more readily beacuse i am so much stronger than at the beginning of the game this deters england from attacking you until you are ready 6 you need to sucker punch england in order to actually win often england will stupidly send all most of their army to mainland europe for a war if you are not ready at that point you can wait longer it is a waiting game until they send their troops to one of their colonial nations whenever i have won against england i never relied on any allies to help me out because the ai is useless across the strait it all about england leaving their main provinces unguarded in the peace deal i make sure to take pale and 1 2 of their provinces more importantly i release wales and the other nation you can release the name escapes me this is simply to weaken england as much as possible at that point it taken me 2 3 more wars to fully annex them in most cases they do eventually get their troops back to the island however it usually staggered and i have found by the time they do i have taken down at least one fort as their smaller stacks start coming onto the island i wipe them costs a lot of manpower money for mercs to do it most of the time though this is why fixing the gold problem is so important early on 7 this should have gone up higher but i tend to military focus from the beginning this may not be necessary but i have found maxing out your military tech and immediately taking a military idea group to be very valuable due to the amount of war in the early game you wo not get to use your first military idea group on the irish opm and probably will only be able to use part of it in the war against scotland but it will be useful against england itself those are the points i feel are relevant off the top of my head not sure if you have specific questions based on your attempts though,3,eu4
Aegisth,taking over ireland has a bit of luck in it but it is pretty consistent scotland is pretty easy to take over honestly england needs luck but then again luck is where preparedness meets opportunity ,2,eu4
Aegisth, r5 i have been playing the irish islands since i bought the game and not too long ago finally completed the luck of the irish achievement on normal however i wanted to do it on very hard i finally tackled it again after learning more about the game and i am immensely satisfied at the progress i have made with this game it ai not easy getting this far in the british isles on very hard ,1,eu4
Aegisth,no cell specifically says that he has a clump of cells in his head and so long as one of the cells in that clump survives he can regenerate it the same regeneration as namekian regeneration ,1,dbz
Aegisth,cell has never had incorrect information about himself before except for delusions of grandeur from his ego what he needed to know about his own body he knew instinctively such as absorbing androids 17 and 18 there no reason to believe cell was wrong about that it also makes sense namekians have the same clump of cells that lets them regenerate and since cell regeneration comes from the namekian regeneration the clump of cells in his head makes sense ,2,dbz
Aegisth, so when warp kamehameha happened his core was not in his head yet or it a plot hole because that what it is ,4,dbz
Aegisth,he does not point to his forehead he literally says he has a clump of cells in his head that will always allow him to regenerate ,4,dbz
Aegisth,oh very interesting i never caught that that really cool that he draws his power from the threshold he is currently residing in ,2,dresdenfiles
Aegisth, temple dogs normally are empowered by the threshold of the place they are protecting oh was this said in a woj or one of the books ,5,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,the warp kamehameha should have taken out cell core that he talks about later on it the biggest imo plot hole of dbz ,10,dbz
Aegisth,daizenshu is not toriyama approved where did you get that info ,9,dbz
Aegisth,huh i do not remember that what was the context of the quote ,3,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,it confirmed that the alternate reality in mm is at an earlier point in the series ,4,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,he cheats ,5,dresdenfiles
Aegisth, he daizenshu guide states that fusion is x power level multiplied by y power level this is why we do not trust the daizenshu with many things ,18,dbz
Aegisth,uh you are very obviously a console only gamer,1,Games
Aegisth,please do not wait on the 7 remake it not going to be the same game,3,Games
Aegisth,well we clearly see that people age in the dbz universe so i can assume that a brain would age as well just like i can assume that they see using light not everything needs to be directly said ,-2,dbz
Aegisth,naruto would not wreck krillin and tien since krillin and tien are much stronger than vegeta was during the saiyan saga,3,dbz
Aegisth,no he does not he puts his brain inside an android body to extend his lifespan but the tissue of his brain would still die over time ,-2,dbz
Aegisth, soon after he started he got bored with the project and how slow it was progressing i do not get where you see this motivation in gero iirc gero left the work to his supercomputer because he did not believe he would survive long enough to complete the work ,1,dbz
Aegisth,no even vegeta first showing would wipe the floor with even eos naruto naruto is city buster maybe mountain buster at best vegeta is a planet buster in his first appearance and he wildly outclasses naruto in terms of speed and strength ,10,dbz
Aegisth,where in the manga is this stated ,1,dbz
Aegisth, round 1 rick wins probably traps doomsday in a parallel universe that has no earth living beings on earth round 2 rick and bulma win rick same as round 1 bulma wins by getting the help of the z fighters specifically current goku and vegeta ,5,whowouldwin
Aegisth,i dont really understand your point ,11,news
Aegisth,much better thanks,1,dndnext
Aegisth,do the same for the lines that start with by making frightful presence a bonus action and by doing this the player does not have to depend ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,instead of putting four spaces in front of greater rage and frenzy and the like put in front instead the spaces do this test with spaces notice how as i go longer you now have to scroll and it gets annoying to read the does this this is a quote and is much easier to read,1,dndnext
Aegisth,what type of book is it ,2,funny
Aegisth,this is easily my favorite dbz meme,12,dbz
Aegisth,you are an idiot,3,smashbros
Aegisth,except people that do bad things are not always inherently evil ,1,dbz
Aegisth,it could sure unless the technology of the time machine was able to interact with the matter in the position of time it was trying to appear in we are talking about time machine technology here it not out of the realm of possibility that the technology would compensate for overlapping atoms ,1,dbz
Aegisth, also scientifically it would be impossible for a bunch of atoms to just appear from out of nowhere like that and if it was it would probably cause an enormous explosion interesting that you consider it impossible when that what the big bang is described as unless you subscribe to the idea that the infinitely dense mass was present before the big bang actually occurred or that it was always there the universe at one point did not exist and suddenly it did additionally i am pretty sure in quantum mechanics at a sub atomic level there are many particles that appear and disappear for instance https www scientificamerican com article are virtual particles rea it would probably cause an enormous explosion possibly unless the time machine takes that into account ,1,dbz
Aegisth, went archery out of combat was useful i was playing in strahd so being able to move quickly through difficult terrain and being able to move with my animal companion while stealthy was great i was able to use most of my abilities at least once a session so much more damage than i expected especially once we reached level 5 i had a wolf companion i only got to level 7 before dying but no did not feel the need to leave it a damn satisfying class that is probably stronger at earlier levels rather than later levels being able to rez my animal companion made me much more interested in using it in combat ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,personally in time travel stories i do not like the creates a paradox idea it possible but when i think about a time traveler the present universe simply has an influx on atoms appear from out of nowhere we see this happen on a subatomic scale from what i understand so to the present universe trunks just appeared out of no where so in my mind trunks would change the future and would not have anything to go back to he would know that in doing so he would erase everything he ever knew and would need to live in the past it would be a one way trip where you doom all those from your future to cease existing ,2,dbz
Aegisth,no he did not that not a bullet it was a ring charged with freeza power that was fired into goku heart while his guard was down goku cannot be shot by bullets and be pierced by them we see this on the very first episode of dragon ball before he even knows what a gun is ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth, he wanted the elk games to show how perfect he is this is fantastic lol the elk games ,17,dbz
Aegisth, massively ftl speed distance from earth to sun is 8min and 20sec for light so roughly 50xftl this is the most likely scenario goku w no guard gets injured by bullets so he would still be dead no no he does not ,3,whowouldwin
Aegisth, when it comes to dying from lack of oxygen it is not ,5,whowouldwin
Aegisth,and yet goku has shown to fight in orbit in bog and able to hold his breath undwrwater for several minutes throughout dragon ball it also makes 0 sense that somehow aiyans die immediately if they go without air for any period of time again use some common sense ,7,whowouldwin
Aegisth,thats how the attack works they do not actually spend months flying to the sun they make it there and back in seconds watch the video this isnt real life ,4,whowouldwin
Aegisth,they are in space for 10 seconds use some common sense,14,whowouldwin
Aegisth,on a short term scale sure but should not we see general trends if used long term ,2,dataisbeautiful
Aegisth,man people really hate on z ending i was fine with it ,2,dbz
Aegisth,you seriously need to read things again before you make these claims right before goku kills buu with the spirit bomb he mentions that maybe he will come back as a better person king yemma who was previously shown as watching the fight decides to grant goku wish and reincarnates buu ,2,dbz
Aegisth,uub had a lot of personality for a one episode character i am not sure you quite remember those last scenes ,0,dbz
Aegisth,oh damn fair that makes a lot more sense ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,these odds are for ad d ,6,dndnext
Aegisth,just read his goodreads review damn glowing review puts it mildly lol i fell in love with rothfuss writing through kingkiller chronicles of course however i fell in love with the man recently in his cameos for critical role such a good guy he added so much to the show ,4,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,wait he is that awesome ,4,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,i am just unsure why you replied to my comment originally though ,67,eu4
Aegisth,congo ,24,eu4
Aegisth,off the top of my head cherokee and ryukuku should also be on this map as they have unique achievements ,288,eu4
Aegisth, when i say not enough to kill buu i mean when goku comments well before even throwing it that it had nowhere near enough power because only gohan and the others had donated to it ah that fair the ki kou hou is a ki manipulation technique the technique name itself means ki manipulation cannon much in the same way that the kaiou ken can amplify goku overall ki for combat purposes tenshinhan is able to manipulate and amplify the ki being put into the attack to devastating effect even though it still requires a considerable amount of ki on his own part so it almost like a kaiou ken put into an attack itself you put 80 of your own ki but you manipulate the ki so the output is several thousand times your own ,1,dbz
Aegisth,the genki dama could not immediately kill buu beacuse he was pure enough to bounce the ball back at goku goku did not have enough energy to counteract that though until the wish restored his power your general explanation makes sense but it also makes tien being able to hold cell down make no sense before it worked because the tien was draining his own life force to keep cell at bay now there no explanation on how it was accomplished ,1,dbz
Aegisth,i see what you mean in that case what is the difference between the ki of a normal ki blast and the ki of the genki dama ,1,dbz
Aegisth,you do realize that relative strengths and comparing how strong people are relative to each other has nothing to do with power levels right people would still compare who would win in a fight and the rate at which people get stronger even without pls ,1,dbz
Aegisth,freeza power jump is magnitudes larger than all other power jumps combined the others are no where near as ridiculous and i do not understand how you can say that they are except if you just view that any quick power jump is ridiculous simply because it a power jump ,1,dbz
Aegisth,so canon is important to me a reader so i know what did and didnt happen within a work of fiction this is literally the only fanbase that tries to say canon does not matter and it boggles my mind ,4,dbz
Aegisth,i am not sure where you are getting that as a statement of fact though it makes sense but the quote i gave does not say all of that where are you getting that ,1,dbz
Aegisth,that incorrect toriyama in an interview said that ki is made from three energies see the link below http www kanzenshuu com translations seg story volume truth about dragon ball in battle the most important thing is the size of your ki and your control over it ki as a concept of course includes such spiritual powers as energy genki courage y ki and right mindedness sh ki 11 no matter how much you train there are limits to physical strength and the only way to overcome that is through ki i think goku was able to approach the mightiest warriors in the universe through strengthening his ki i believe the kikoho does not use genki but uses yuki or shoki i would have to dig to find more ,1,dbz
Aegisth,they are in a weird gray area of canon honestly ,2,dbz
Aegisth,yeah if he gets their life force it makes more sense we see that life force techniques are very powerful where we see tien use the kikoho to hold back imperfect cell if we do not assume that it makes no sense ,5,dbz
Aegisth, super powerscaling sucks but allow me to just gloss over goku with a battle power of 416 managing to hold down raditz with a battle power in the thousands fair super is insane for making kuririn and 17 fight at equal levels with ssjb goku but allow me to forget that trunks initial battle power was 5 when confronting mecha freeza power suppression is not a concept the issue is not with power suppression it with inconsistency when do characters to go their highest ss form and then suppress their power as much as possible why transform in the first place it implies the transformation was needed super makes stupid power leaps freeza a naturally strong being who required minimal training achieving near god levels of power in four months please but let me just completely ignore the asinine zenkai boost goku gets after his fight with ginyu a jump from 90 000 to 3 000 000 not laughable at all 90 000 to 3 000 000 is a drop in the bucket compared to freeza 150 000 000 to god level jump seriously how do you not understand that it feels cheap that at the rate freeza trained he could have trained for a week and wiped the floor with ssj goku had he trained for 2 whole weeks he would have made ssj2 gohan look like a joke if he trained for a month he would have made ssj3 goku look like a child goku trained for 7 years in otherworld with history greatest heroes and never came close to god level freeza jump makes all of the z fighters struggles and training look laughable why was freeza scared of the legendary ssj when he could have trained for a week and made any newborn ssj look like a fucking joke being upset with freeza jump is one of the least things anyone should criticize it a large flaw in super and poor writing ,7,dbz
Aegisth,oh nice that does make sense that means it also like the kikoho do you have a scan of that panel by chance ,6,dbz
Aegisth,for the math 750 000 humans 5 pl 3 750 000 increas to his pl yeah still does not make much sense maybe at an average 20 pl 750 000 humans 20 pl 15 000 000 increase to his pl maybe that better it difficult to tell at that point because we do not use pl anymore it may be that absorbing someone gives more than just their pl in addition ,7,dbz
Aegisth,you literally just repeated the same thing again power scaling is not important in dbs dbz why do you think they stopped using the scouters they can fluctuate their power levels this shows you obviously do not even understand what power scaling means it was established frieza was a genetic anomaly in dbz and they used that in dbs freiza getting revived and getting even stronger and four months then he ever been is right in character with who he is it part of him and it been established just because a new show expands on former information detailed in a previous show does not make it lazy writing it called attention to detail what you do not have because all your points are answered if you watch the show you literally ignored my argument and said nah it makes sense because he a genetic anomaly you are wrong it not lazy writing you are not worth talking to ,0,dbz
Aegisth, it not condescending when you are just wrong sure thing bud ,0,dbz
Aegisth,because we like consistency in writing ,1,dbz
Aegisth,ah you are right my bad ,1,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,the condescension drips from your comments the animation for all of dragonball dbz dbgt has been pretty sub par in the original airings the reason db and dbz look better than dbs is because you have only seen the fixed animations on dvd bluray re air and kai releases they are doing the same thing for super and i never said that dbz or dbgt had good airings i compared it to other good anime such as one punch man fate zero fate stay night fma fma brotherhood hell cowboy bebop was drawn in 1997 and it still has better art and animation than most of dbs it was established in z that frieza and his father were genetic freaks of their race and never had to train to fight in their entire lives they we are just naturally strong it makes sense that frieza can get that powerful that fast he a genetic freak and we have never seen him actually train until rof i could write a whole post just on this it bad writing i do not care that he a genetic freak four months of training to grow more powerful than every character in z ever grew devalues all of the hard training the z fighters did goku is noted a fighting genius multiple times he trained 7 years in otherworld and did not gain a fraction of the power freeza did the worst part about it is there was a very easy explanation for it have freeza be resurrected sometime during the timeskip after cell have him notice the power of gohan and vegeta and realize he needs to train then when buu comes around make him realize his training has not been enough and have him really push himself that satisfying taking 5 6 years to find that form makes sense and is not a copout edit think about this if freeza was worried about the legendary ssj so badly why did not he just train for four months and have the power to rival a god or maybe he was just worried about goku why on his way back to earth that took a year did he not train for a literal week at the rate that he progressed in 4 months a week training would have let him beat the ever living shit out of any ssj short of ssj2 gohan and you know what he would just have to train one more week to accomplish that think about that our characters spent an entire year training for cell freeza would have killed them all easily if he trained for two weeks is that honestly satisfying to you as a reader i am pretty sure you are talking about clone vegeta v s gotenks because base vegeta would absolutely stomp ss3 gotenks he trained with whis alongside goku for months and then some and gotenks has barely had any training since he fought super buu except it does not make any sense this means that base vegeta is stronger than super buu combined with other events such as human characters keeping up with the new cast it means everyone is somehow stronger than super buu how no fucking clue why because the plot said they needed to be it bad writing the only people who says power scaling makes no sense often do not understand the power scale or just make up shit for it these fighters have the ability to manipulate their power levels which they do constantly throughout the series dbz dbs bullshit dbz and db had clear power scaling throughout the series the jumps in power made sense relative to what the characters were doing when i say power scaling makes no sense i am talking about base vegeta ssj3 gotenks vegeta goku goku ssj2 android 17 look at the difference super saiyan makes base gohan would have been shitstomped by perfect cell in base form in the cell saga ssj2 however wrecked cell easily ssj2 gohan perfect cell base gohan android 17 base vegeta ssj3 gotenks seriously based on the power scaling in dbs android 17 so far outranks ssj3 gotenks that it like comparing ssj2 gohan power to base gohan why the hell can android 17 get that strong for decades the strongest being in the galaxy besides gods or buu was less powerful than an ssj1 now most people are approaching the level of gods it makes no sense and defeats any sense of progression the series may have had beforehand why was buu so scary when a handful of people could have trained really hard and so thoroughly outclassed him imagine if buu showed up now in the series literally android 17 would have done short work of him it makes all of the buu saga seem cheap in comparison not to mention the freeza and cell sagas the power scaling is stupid in dbs hell yes roshi and tien over goten and trunks all the fighters except for goku and a few other know that their universe will be erased if they lose and the rest of them do not goten and trunks would mess around and lose like they did against buu just because they are immature also having 2 people fuse into 1 just makes them more of a target 2 birds 1 stone goten and trunks are supposed to be 14 they are not morons regardless of what bad writing leads you to believe additionally based on what we see of power scaling in the show you could throw them in the time chamber with vegeta or goku and they would soon approach god levels or at least ssj3 gotenks levels which at one point in time was considered the strongest mortal in the universe goten and trunks would be much better off than roshi and tien goku was of guard like he is most of the time it been stated in dragonball and dbs that he lets his guard down too often he overconfident but he is not off guard most of the time it actually is not stated in db or dbz find me that panel where it stated because it not dbs started that it also does not matter there are plenty of other ways for goku to let his guard down and get beaten because of it for instance goku in the freeza saga turned back to base after beating final form freeza why not have freeza anticipate this once goku goes down to base have freeza use the rest of his remaining energy to sucker punch him and shoot a death beam through his heart same exact moment same theme but the audience would not feel cheated because how can goku literally take a bullet to his head in the first episode of db but get caught off guard by a fucking laser it not good writing because it seems cheap in the wrong way it clear to me that you are only seeing what you want to see through your ros tinted glasses you cannot except dbs because you are used to the already finished and perfected dbz anime and if you do not believe me that they fixed the animations the dbz anime is not perfect by any means i compare dbs to other good anime that have come out in the 20 years since dbz ended dbs is embarrassing in comparison you say i have rose tinted glasses but you refuse to see any of the poor aspects of dbs the art is not good the animation is subpar the writing does have holes notice how i love the dbs manga but dislike the anime because the manga has it more together things make more sense and are more internally consistent than the anime so no i do not just shit on dbs as a whole i just dislike the anime because of its inconsistencies ,0,dbz
Aegisth,except he did not change lash he changed her shadow it a very different thing ,5,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,what do you mean won his freedom ,4,dresdenfiles
Aegisth, man if super was bi weekly it would be a dramatic difference for sure would totally be down for that i love the manga as well hopefully the villains can be written a bit better in future arcs yeah zamasu was not done as well unfortunate i wish the manga got a bit more love so it could expand on points more ,2,dbz
Aegisth, but super is done week to week so i give it a pass on the non fight scenes lol i suppose that part of my disappointment i would rather wait a month between episodes if it looked good i really hope this tournament arc sets up a big shift for the show story wise i am reserved on my hopes for super i am excited for the next chapter of the manga though ,1,dbz
Aegisth,you mention one punch man and fate stay night as fast fighting styles and i love those shows the difference is the art always look good during even the most hectic scenes like genos vs saitama that scene was very fast paced but it looked awesome and yeah scenes like vegito vs zamasu look good but take a look at the scene where they all say goodbye to future trunks and honestly tell me you are satisfied with that level of art because to me it looks like a 16 year old with some talent drew that i am not expecting fate zero or fate stay night levels for this show because those are some of the best looking animes ever but i feel like i can expect naruto level art animation from the successor to dragon ball i really do not think that too much to ask ,1,dbz
Aegisth,lot of things art is embarrassingly bad most of the time this compared to an anime like fma brotherhood that came out a decade ago animation is subpar most of the time freeza getting so strong in 4 months ssj3 gotenks base vegeta ssj2 trunks keeping up with black ss rage having no explanation above three points can be thrown into powerscaling makes 0 sense buu consistently sidelined roshi and tien over goten and trunks goten not being around the fucking pilaf gang goku being shot by the laser alien poachers are somehow a problem for a god level being i was super excited about super and i quite like the manga minus vegeta not being able to lift 40 tons come on now i started with super when it first aired and the first episodes being so disastrously bad was a kick to the nuts especially after how good bog and rof looked in comparison i am just disappointed by it i would have been fine with 12 fantastic episodes but instead we get 90 episodes that look like some bad 90s anime much like the bad art animation of the original dbz show ,-1,dbz
Aegisth,you know what this is a dumb conversation i am not going to continue arguing our points because i recognize that i am upset with super for being so disappointing and i wo not actually argue well for myself when i am this annoyed with it i disagree with your points you disagree with mine we are not going to get anywhere ,2,dbz
Aegisth, ssb is still hard on the body and can only be held for so long so because he did it once he will never do it again how does that make sense i do not see your point here that it completely within character goku has not come close to mastering ssb so he is going to continue using it every chance he get it perfect practice to test ki control against weaker opponents you completely ignored my point of goku using lower forms while fighting people in literally every other instance in his life ,-4,dbz
Aegisth, goku likes to master using a form and using that form in every fight is a great way to test it he literally only done this once and he did not use the form in every fight he used the form all the time he not doing that with ssb goku going ssb and then holding back is completely possible because he is doing it to practice holding the form better and longer except it not within goku character name one time goku has gone to a higher super saiyan form than he thought he needed during a fight ,6,dbz
Aegisth,except it pretty obvious that super saiyan is used to reach a new plateu that the character normally cannot reach going super saiyan blue implies the previous forms were not enough to match the opponent no other time in memory has goku gone to his strongest form immediately in order to test someone he always stays as low as possible in regards to transformations ,8,dbz
Aegisth,they never really go into it we know that the kamehameha takes all of the user ki and focuses it into one point for the blast it useful because it can be used relatively quickly with a lot of energy unleashed we have never been given a distinction on what the other attacks do except maybe special beam canon but even that was not given much detail ,4,dbz

Aegisth, goku also learned how nullify the ki of beerus punches during their fight mid fight to stop the universe from shaking apart analyzed and found the weakness to tien multi clone technique and solar flare during their tournament match the ability to learn a technique upon seeing it is not unique to just buu goku also has it i cannot think of anymore off the top of my head but it is not something i am just making up ,2,dbz

Aegisth,what archetype do you plan on going at level 3 ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,so to start off i believe frenzy rage is the would efault version of rage it is the barbarian rage with no limits put on it that being said i have always felt that the relationship between a barbarian and their totem animal was symbiotic the barbarian rage is dulled by the totem animal because the spirit feeds on the rage in return the totem spirit grants the barbarian special abilities my totem bear barbarian lost connection with his totem spirit in a fit of searing hot rage after weeks of slow build up where his rage was overcoming his normal behavior it came to a head when his grandfather head was dropped at his feet and he spiritually pushed away his totem and let the rage overtake him physically he went into a frenzy rage and broke his connection with the totem animal and became a frenzy barbarian he no longer had anything feeding off his rage so he reverted to the most natural form it not quite the same for your barbarian but if your player is cool with the idea he could switch totems maybe have him go a few sessions as frenzy before another spirit animal tries to up the spot the bear initially held once it does he picks a new animal and gains its benefits that being said do not force this on the player it a cool idea and they may be into it but do not force it ,5,dndnext
Aegisth,the idea is that the first time he goes back sets up for when he goes back the second time it just so happens that he does the same thing the second time as the third and fourth somehow his actions in the past were set up in a way that he only affected the second version of himself while each subsequent version actions ended in the same result ,2,AskReddit

Aegisth,i felt the splitting headache before he even opened his eyes it was a pounding in the temples and a persistent throb along the neck a car honked its horn outside and i could feel him instinctively flinch in pain this one was going to be bad i am surprised he had not puked in his sleep that was always a constant worry for him that i had to keep nagging would o not sleep on your back set up the pillow so your head is never face up drink water before bed and have a piece of bread to settle your stomach it would become a mantra the past few months one of the few things i could consistently get him to do i had to keep him alive if i was going to get myself sober i felt him reach around the side of the bed eyes closed flailing for something his hand hit something hard and he grabbed it pulling it up close his hands shook as he lifted the jug to his mouth but i could hear him think to himself that it was not that bad and it was only because of the hangover i whispered back that it was from the addiction whispers were best i found had i screamed it to him he would have gotten up and walked right back to the liquor store to drown me out it would happened time and time again a whisper though a whisper was silent enough that he could ignore it if he wanted and he often did but every time i whispered i felt him strain his mind to listen to my words he did not want to admit it but he wanted to listen to someone that was telling him what he was doing was wrong he finished chugging the water and screwed the cap back on his head collapsed back to the pillow and he moaned and curled into a ball he was nauseous i could feel that now his muscles ached and his head pounded had he not had half a bottle of gin the night before he could have easily had the flu but he did not have the flu it took about an hour before the need to pee got him out of bed not much got him out of the bed anymore and that worried me more and more i could hear his thoughts most of the time and they were self loathing and scared i tried to whisper phrases that might stick i need help i cannot do this anymore i am slowly losing everything some stuck some did not most were reasoned away i could hear my whispers bounce off the inside of his mind and morph i need help turned int but i can think i can do this myself a little longer i can manage on my own i cannot do this anymore morphed into but what does it matter not like there anything better out there for me and finally i am slowly losing everything morphed into good whispers can only go so far and as i watched him through his own eyes stumbling to the toilet for his morning drunk shits i knew that all i could do was hope hope that my whispers were enough because he was going to hit rock bottom soon and that was his best chance i had to hope that my whispers were on the forefront of his mind when he finally became desperate otherwise i probably wo not have the chance to whisper to him anymore ,2,WritingPrompts

Aegisth,i think the same thing can be said of ssj overall there was so much legend built up with the transformation the saiyan race had not seen a super saiyan for thousands of years and not only is goku able to transform at will but every saiyan alive is able to transform i just think if you are going to peg ssg writing as bad you should do the same to ssj i would have no argument then personally i think it would have been awesome if goku could not go ssj consistently he instead trained and learned other techniques and ssj came out almost randomly when goku was upset sometimes it happened mid fight and he was super powerful and it disappeared once he lost the rage others it would only come at the very end seldomly he could control it for an entire fight as the series progressed he would gain more control and his final form would be fpssj would have made the legend much cooler ,2,dbz

Aegisth,a large part of this depends on if filthy has a character concept personality in mind and whether that will influence his decision based on watching him stream for so long i think he would prefer mechanics since vyctor explained the subclasses well enough i will tackle races there are a few races that work well with monk naturally tabaxi aarakocra hill dwarf wood elf tabaxi tabaxi are humanoid cats with some interesting quirks personality wise mechanically they work well for three reasons 2 to dex slashing unarmed strike feline agility can move double their speed during a round they cannot use this ability until the spend a turn having moved 0 ft the slashing unarmed strike is cool as it gives the monk a different damage type than normal this does not normally matter in 5e since resistance is not big based on damage type but it has its uses flavor wise it a lot of fun feline agility really shines for a monk since you are the fastest class in the game doubling your additional movement means you can run around the battlefiled and plant yourself wherever you want there will never be a time where you are just 5 feet away from an enemy when you are a tabaxi monk aarakocra 2 dex 1 wis perfect for a monk flying speed of 50 feet note that this does not let you hover if you end your turn 40 ft in the air you will start falling unarmed strikes do slashing damage the flying speed and slashing unarmed strikes are the cool part of the aarakocra mechanically it allows you to negate one of the big drawbacks of the monk as you get into later levels they do not have many options dealing with flying enemies you can throw things sure but monk typically punch enemies this negates that disadvantage hill dwarf 2 con 1 wis dwarven toughness 1 hp per level dwarves usually have trouble getting to their opponents since they are a small race but with the monk additional speed this becomes more of a non issue especially with the mobile feat the hill dwarf is useful mostly because of the hp increase monk are not hp tanks and the increase to con and the extra 1 hp can mean the difference between going down and staying up wood elf 2 dex 1 wis fey ancestry advantage on saving throws against being charmed and cannot be put to sleep speed 35 ft mask of the wild stat increases are perfect for the monk personally i like this thematically mostly but the extra 5 ft of movement is nice combined with a monk and fey ancestry helps with the monk lack of a wisdom saving throw proficiency most spells that force you to roll a wis save are charm effects so having advantage on them is great because your score is not going to be amazing until about lvl 14 ,1,filthyrobot

Aegisth,both characters dex saving throws dc 15 success half damage 9d6 force damage this accomplishes two things let the player have their fun shows the player they have better options than to do this at lvl 20 it important to reward a player for creative thinking but not let them introduce a mechanic that breaks the game overall by forcing the monk to take damage when they run into someone it naturally discourages the use of this type of attack it also is satisfying when thought about in terms of common sense the monk is coming to a dead stop at 109 mph it going to hurt the player does not feel jipped that i put a penalty on them and they feel cool that they actually accomplished something ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,you need to ask yourself is letting your players sleep in their armor so much a determent to your game that you are going to penalize them do you want to make your players have to deal with anything tedious if you want the battle to be a bit more difficult add an extra wolf into the mix taking away their armor is not fun for a player ,1,dndnext

Aegisth, it was established that once a saiyan goes ssj the first time they can access it later at will where is this established in a concrete way please provide sources because i have read through the manga several times and that never explained ,1,dbz
Aegisth,all we know about ssj is that it was a form achieved by a pure hearted saiyan awakened by rage there are plenty of times where a saiyan goes ssj without being in a rage where your complaint there ,1,dbz

Aegisth,not one jump in z was ever as large a jump as either freeza jump or 17 apparent jump goku going from 9 000 to 3 000 000 is like someone taking a step in a set of stairs freeza in comparison jumped over mt everest ,2,dbz
Aegisth,yeah but using it as an excuse to say 17 power jump is not bullshit because freeza made the jump just like it is not right because freeza jump was bad writing ,2,dbz
Aegisth,or the other possibility is that super believes they are strong enough to stand up to ssb ,1,dbz
Aegisth,wow you ignored my points entirely and tried to make my post look dumb by saying it is the same stupid argument repeated even though each of my points were right that a next level troll there try actually arguing instead of throwing a hissy fit ,3,dbz
Aegisth,except it been a thing for the z fighters to be able to adjust their power throughout the series holding back is a trope so embedded in the series that it become a staple so tell me again why goku could not have held back using ssj2 and ssj3 like he done against almost all opponents he ever faced ,4,dbz
Aegisth, androids did not because they liked living on earth cell did not because he wanted to test his strength fat buu did not because he was just trying to have fun and eat candy amongst other things super buu did not because he wanted to fight the strong guy and because he still had feelings for hercule kid buu did blow up earth he did not blow up the kai planet because he wanted to fight goku and vegeta and they ran when he did that last time do not give a shit about zamasu because super writing makes little sense ,6,dbz
Aegisth,and that jump was bullshit in itself ,3,dbz
Aegisth, no offense i cringe these do not match up ,2,dbz
Aegisth,then why did he go ssj2 and ssj3 against future trunks ,2,dbz
Aegisth,this also does not take into account that the z fighters have been able to slide their ki to minimal levels since the saiyan saga it was a main point of that saga that they can hide their ki ,1,dbz
Aegisth,there a reason why people say that was filler ignore that that scene was written by some random person at toei it essential fanfiction which is easy to realize since goku gets shot in the head in the first encounter in dragonball and has about the same reaction ,1,dbz
Aegisth, yes but this is outside of battle during battle the rage returns making the form somewhat less focused than ssb nowhere is this even implied goku remains calm even during the fighting ki consumption is still the same that the exact opposite of what the form is described as ,0,dbz
Aegisth,can you provide evidence that this analogy is correct because while it makes sense and calms my annoyance at super as a whole it just conjecture from what i understand you are basically extrapolating that since ssb uses god ki and whis states that god ki is all about control that they can use ssb in this way however that does not necessarily mean what you described ,1,dbz
Aegisth,why did you comment on this comment from 4 months ago ,1,PokemonReborn
Aegisth, is not done how it should be or just plain is not good the pretension drips from your comment you might as well say if you like the dub you are an uncultured moron you should only like the pure dbz of the manga ,11,dbz
Aegisth, what is there to prefer one is the real goku and the other is an inaccurate flimsy imitation this high and mighty attitude is one of the things i dislike about this sub ,31,dbz

Aegisth,because he was a pretty big bully and he can come across as a dick even now ,12,smashbros
Aegisth,they can but you can also respect that it bothers a lot of people and decide that your stubbornness to exercise your free speech is not worth another state of mind when there are plenty of other substitutes if you decide not to respect that people will call you an asshole because you show that you value your desire to use the word over the potential hurt it will cause others ,1568,dataisbeautiful

Aegisth, remindme one week,1,OldSchoolCool
Aegisth,goku went ssb during a beam struggle with krillin i do not care if goku was using 25 of his power there should be absolutely no way for krillin to be able to stand up to it there are inconsistencies within super you cannot deny that they do not exist the weaker people can be useful sure but in each of the instance you provided the technique mattered greatly kienzan cuts through anything from what we know and the kikoho uses a user actual life force to fuel the blow but we see in the latest super episodes krillin somehow beam struggling with ssb goku that the inconsistency ,21,dbz
Aegisth, suspend their disbelief suspending disbelief happens all the time we suspend our disbelief that something like ki exists narratives still need to be internally consistent ,12,dbz
Aegisth, so sparring puts you on the same level as someone we just had an episode where krillin forced goku into super saiyan and momentarily held off an attack from ssb goku base should be stronger than gotenks yet no one is claiming krillin is any where near that level because it was simply a sparring match vegeta was caught off guard by how strong his son was at an early age and was simply sparring to get an idea of his power and the moment trunks landed a hit vegeta got serious and floored his ass on the spot the point i am making is that we have seen characters far weaker than their sparring partner do relatively well this is not something unique to goten and trunks honestly i have no response to this because super anime has the most ridiculously stupid power scaling that i cannot argue comparisons none of it makes sense in anyway so i wo not continue the conversation sorry ,1,dbz
Aegisth,where are you getting that number from ,5,television
Aegisth,i mean we have a direct comparison between the two vegeta had trouble dodging all of trunks blows and was more than surprised by his power gohan had trouble against goten and was sparring with him fairly evenly during their fight 18 was scared of the kids ki attack during the tournament and they were keeping up with her pace for pace during their fight the kids are at least as powerful as the androids if not imperfect cell we have direct evidence of that ,7,dbz
Aegisth,they were certainly stronger than the androids trunks was able to land a hit on vegeta in the time chamber and vegeta was trying to dodge his moves goten was moving so quickly he was giving gohan a run for his money during their training as well both vegeta and gohan were fpssj as well and while gohan was not as powerful as his younger self he was still more powerful than the androids the kids are probably imperfect cell level or semi perfect cell level ,5,dbz

Aegisth,if a player tried to talk their way out of a large boss fight by trying to convince the guy to step down they would have to roll immensely well just because you beat an insight roll does not mean the enemy stops being hostile they may feel more guilty about killing you but it not going to stop weeks and months of emotional build up in their mind ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,no the rules clearly state you can only sneak attack once per turn so the daggers could hit at the same time but sneak attack only happens once per turn so you only roll the dmg dice once ,6,dndnext

Aegisth, that if it was total garbage you would think 175k playtesters would have noticed either you pulled the description total garbage out of your ass and had nothing to do with this conversation or you are implying that i think the phb class is total garbage ,1,dndnext
Aegisth, everyone was allowed 1 new character after death but the new characters all started at level 1 why this seems very odd to me ,9,dndnext
Aegisth,my god let stop if your dm lets you shove a goodberry down an unconscious person throat then goodberry is a better choice if you had to choose between these two if you do not have goodberry this spell ai not bad that all i am saying man ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,man this is your initial comment it not as efficient as doing the same thing with goodberries i argued the benefits of using the spell with the elixir instead that all ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,but then i need to be a variant human not the many many other races available ,2,dndnext
Aegisth, low low cost sarcasm ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,except many dm that i have played with do not allow goodberries to be given to unconscious teammates and not many classes get goodberry ,0,dndnext
Aegisth,unless you do not want to waste the spell slot for cure wounds in battle or you want to give your non spellcasters a way to heal someone that been downed ,6,dndnext
Aegisth,again did not call it total garbage ,4,dndnext
Aegisth,yeah but in terms of using it at night before a long rest it makes a bunch of basic healing potions for free ,4,dndnext
Aegisth,you can use the potion in battle though goodberry is 1 at a time in battle ,4,dndnext
Aegisth,i do not understand your initial point then ,5,dndnext
Aegisth,except that is what you are implying i asked a question and wanted him to confirm if that what you were implying not hyperbole when you say no phb is fine but the designers say no phb was not fine you are implying that you are correct and the designers are wrong ,10,dndnext
Aegisth,you also disagree with the designers they did not update every class with the ua they added archetypes for every class they only reworked the ranger ,6,dndnext
Aegisth,i never used the word unplayable ,11,dndnext
Aegisth, for thousands of years the majority thought slavery was pretty great but that was wrong too what a ridiculous hyperbole you also conveniently ignored that the designers of 5e agreed enough with the complaints that they reworked ranger are you saying that you understand game balance enough that you know better than the designers themselves because that what it looks like you are implying ,29,dndnext
Aegisth,look man when the community is vocal enough that the actual designers say sorry we get that the beastmaster is not what you wanted we agree so here an update the ranger is not fine as written going against the grain is fine but there a reason why phb beastmaster was disliked so much ,80,dndnext
Aegisth,i am not sure how i feel about this ,2,dbz
Aegisth,it is but the post i responded to was talking about killing a downed enemy as a thing intelligent enemies do every time they do not ,2,dndnext
Aegisth, and your allies do not seem in desperate need of immediate assistance the tide of a battle can turn in literal seconds your ally may seem fine now but you know what is even better than fine giving them an overwhelming advantage against their opponent for stupid enemies they would just finish the person off regardless unless directly attacked as they would not have the grasp of tactics that would make them change targets before finishing off their opponent stupid as in a zombie that was told kill sure stupid as in a bear not so much hell a bear might not be able to tell the difference between unconscious and dead in a humanoid ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,or the enemy would ignore all of the other party members upon seeing that and go after the cleric himself a much smarter way for an enemy to behave a wolf sure what you are saying makes sense but an intelligent enemy would focus fire on the healer ,4,dndnext
Aegisth, clearly you have strong feelings against attacking downed players in any circumstance i have strong feelings about playing enemies as they would make decisions logically or emotionally in real life attacking downed players is fine but a trained killer that downed a wizard and knows a fighter is coming in right behind him is not going to take 6 seconds to kill the wizard he going to turn and face the next threat killing a downed player in a way that does not make sense for the enemy is frustrating as a player because you cannot rely on the fact that the enemies are real people in a world ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,use some common sense if you were in a fight surrounded by 3 dudes and you knocked one clean out would you then waste another 5 seconds making sure he was dead or would you turn to the other two and hopefully stop them from killing you in turn enemies want to live an unconscious enemy is no immediate threat the barbarian to his right that still coming after him that the immediate threat ,4,dndnext
Aegisth,most enemies even dumb ones would rather prioritize attacking the living dangerous threats than waste time finishing off the unconscious one ,8,dndnext
Aegisth,except theres a time and a place for cliches like creating a dream episode on april fools as a way to prank everyone ,66,rickandmorty
Aegisth, i and many others do not feel that a single good feature justifies the rest of the archetype it comes late but retaliation is also very good additionally frenzy works better with the brutal critical abilities than the other types do ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,except most people probably have never played as a frenzy barbarian because the penalties are harsher in theory than they are in practice my current barbarian is a frenzy barbarian he switched into it for rp reasons from totem and while the exhaustion sucks it just means i need to be more careful with when i use it it becomes a one per long rest ability or 2 per long rest ability depending on the situation and it an interesting rp mechanic does my character feels it worth frenzying when he knows he will feel like shit afterwards additionally i do not find the frenzy rage to be the best part of frenzy barbarian mindless rage is being immune to fear and charms while raging has literally saved my party from a tpk twice and it makes up for my meh wisdom saving throw having played both i honestly rate mindless rage over the bear totem resistance to all damage this is coming from someone who has played both totem and frenzy barb for dozens of hours in the same campaign with the same character ,3,dndnext
Aegisth,the hell is that supposed to mean ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,unless you are a frenzy raging barbarian and doing bar 17 fighter 3 in that case there an argument for champion instead ,5,dndnext
Aegisth,in the campaign that i play our goblin paladin follows helm however she came in not knowing what god was granting her powers and the character was searching for that answer for a while the player left it it up to the dm to choose and he chose based on how the character acted during the campaign ,3,dndnext
Aegisth, why do everybody assume that paladins have a god the only classes that have a god are the warlock and the cleric seriously man if you take 30 seconds to really think about it you will have your answer ,0,dndnext

Aegisth, oh no the dragon used magic to make my friend not able to see it i am the only one that can ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,except the spell says that the person would rationalize anything that happens with the illusion if he sees his teammate not get hurt he would rationalize that the dragon wanted to try and make him think his friend was going to burn to death maybe to frighten him or maybe the dragon realized last second he wanted to keep the friend alive or somehow the friend gained immunity to fire the spell specifically says that the person rationalizes anything that does not make sense ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,but why would it think to make a check in the first place if it truly believes the illusion and rationalizes everything ,11,dndnext
Aegisth,this gave me a giggle ,18,todayilearned

Aegisth, remember next time you use the word zenkai in discussion to refer to the saiyan near death power up that there a 90 chance you are using a term a crappy fansite made up or badly misinterpreted in 2003 this is cool to me i like how dbz was such a popular thing before the internet became what it is today that fan terms like this and others such as ultime or mystic gohan were able to become incredibly widespread that the community still uses it ,1,dbz

Aegisth,dresdenverse has all of maybe an hour to save the planet vegeta and nappa are more than willing to destroy a planet or its populace or both because they were slighted or bored they do it for a living ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,alcohoic withdrawal can kill you just as easily as opiate withdrawal ,0,LifeProTips
Aegisth,yeah it hard to see who could even put up a fight because we do not have many feats for anyone wizards could prep for them sure but in a yo we just met let fight scenario most everyone would lose ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, irrelevant to the fight due to sword hax except if nicodemus was anywhere fast enough to fight the saiyans he could have stopped murphy from drawing the sword before she could even start to remove it from its scabbard hell if he was that fast he would have been able to get into hades vault by himself easily lso i have never seen a single episode of dbz i always thought it was pretty silly the saiyans move at the least at several thousand mph arguably they move ftl at this point or at relativistic speeds ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, nicodemus might be able to take one of them depending on how the judas noose works and if anduriel can block harm the saiyans nicodemus almost got beat by a worn out cop wielding a katana ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, they would not have to most of these have shown the ability to use their will to outright freeze mortals which the saiyans explicitly are mother winter went easy on dresden for a certain value of easy she would still kill him and dresden has enough willpower to match vegeta if not surpass him and moreover mother winter was taking her time where do you see that dresden for sure has enough willpower to match or beat vegeta vegeta is the same man that maintained his sense of pride through his entire childhood and being enslaved to freeza the same one that has been dogged in everything he wanted in his life you cannot casually say dresden beats him moreover were uriel a galaxy buster angels never lie so i take his word for it to freeze vegeta for the amount of time mother winter froze harry he would easily beat him even ssb goku has been seen to die if hit by something weaker while offguard granted ssb vegeta is an entirely different beast than saiyan arc vegeta i am pretty sure he would not get frozen in the first place except uriel has not shown the ability to do that cite it for me if he has also conditionally immortal means immortal unless certain conditions are met mab cannot be killed period unless attacked on halloween or some other oblique condition is met fights on the table at best her power would diminish but i am pretty sure that as long as she survives the speedblitz her power surpasses the saiyans at saiyan saga by magnitudes and her immortality is enough to give her at least a 4 10 of surviving it prolly more earth is still fucked though because then the equilibrium between the courts will be upset her immortality is specifically stated that she would come back after a period of time not that she literally would not be phased by anything you have no evidence that her power beats the saiyans by magnitudes still yeah if you wanna be pedantic we do not have a proof i am not being pedantic you have arguments that have almost no evidence except for wishful thinking you even say this yourself your argument is the same as when people say saitama can beat anyone because the author says he super powerful and cannot be beat yo this is www speculation is fine to a point but you cannot make things up because they fit who you would want to know implied feats if taken at their best value could beat the two saiyans but implied feats are weak in www and if you want to get right down to it mab could not win neither could the other fairies because they are not allowed to expressly kill mortals in the first place ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,not really a solid feat we can use though how long would it take for him to unmake a galaxy if it several hundreds of millions of years well sure but does not make him strong enough to do it in a fight ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,we do not know under what circumstances he can do that though he says he a galaxy buster and he has no reason to lie but what if he is a galaxy buster if he self destructs or something similar he would not be able to call on that energy casually by any means and he might not be able to do that in a standard fight without risking the planet which he wo not do ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,has he done something like that before ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, mab was very explicitly stated to be conditionally immortal on cold days the mantle was just uncoditionally so oh you are talking about the whole killing a god on halloween thing fair but as a fairy she should be killable regardless it just that mortals do not normally have the power to do it on halloween night mab would come back but she would still be killed in terms of the fight denarians can be incap won ez that is true but i am pretty sure angels being immortal as part of their powerset is a plot point on skin game was it i know uriel gave up his grace and so was killable during that time but functional immortality i do not remember being called out we have no hard proof that the eldest gruff is immortal but he seems to hold a similar position to the erlking and kringle both of which explicitly are immortal their mantles are they can still be killed although they would reform does not really matter for these purposes all in all yes my rationalization is shaky for the others but mab is surely immortal and so is the erlking who would love to hunt some saiyans and also odin the mothers and hades as well as the white god all of which can get at least a 4 10 if not much higher while i agree with you that most would be able to in some form they just do not have the feats for it none of these characters have shown the ability to outspeed one of the saiyans and that might very well be because they have never had gone full out but we just do not know ,3,whowouldwin
Aegisth,uh mab herself is not immortal the mantle is immortal from what we understand but mab herself can very easily die we see that with what happened with maive and tatiyana neither rashiid or the merlin are immortal the denarians are very powerful but not immortal we are never told that angels cannot die i am pretty sure plus denarians can be incap won by killing their host easy eldest gruff is powerful but nothing says he is immortal not sure where you are getting that their immortal ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,does he i do not remember that ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,i mean fairies can be hurt by things that are not iron dresden flash freezes and then shatters a member of the winter court vegeta and nappa are casual continent busters at least vegeta is we do not have any real endurance feats for mab one way or another the mantle wo not die but mab herself will ,3,whowouldwin
Aegisth,except if he cannot react to vegeta and nappa because they are too fast he cannot win uriel also would not just destroy the planet either ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,it comes down to if vegeta and nappa attack right away i think the merlin could use some hax magic against them but if they are prepared merline simply wo not react in time mab might be able to keep up with them the best speed feat we have for her is when she took the handgun from dresden at the end of cold days she did is so fast he did not even realize it happened but it hard to quantify because the limit we have is dreden reaction time which is not that high ,3,whowouldwin
Aegisth,i do not think uriel has the speed feats ,1,whowouldwin

Aegisth, there is zero rationalizing that eating the m ms makes sense to someone who has a job that likely required a degree you obviously have never seen the show andy is portrayed as a pretty ridiculously dumb and it is an unspoken question on how he survives day to day he does not have a degree i do not think he even graduated high school he got the job through nepotism he a glorified secretary that people keep around because he has a good heart what is sad here is that your so called social norms call for people to look the other way so called social norms man what the hell do you mean so called social norms are around for a reason they let us communicate without needing to detail out every single little thing we mean also there no argument for a defense of character here except you are the only one in this thread who has this opinion the joke is not hard to understand even if you do not watch the show we can make a few observations and assumptions here observations at least 4 450 people found this funny at least 90 people were engaged enough to comment about it at least 250 people were engaged enough to go the comments and upvote the top comment it is dumb to eat obviously painted m ms a grown man should know eating them is bad another character matter of factly tells the grown man to throw up and the wording implies that his actions do not surprise her he must do things like this often so you can reasonably assume based on observationss that people enjoyed the content it funny overall additionally since people found it funny and there is no additional content we can assume that the joke is within the text since the only obvious joke is why does a grown man think it okay to eat painted m ms we can assume that is why it funny we can make other assumptions about this character that most people do naturally the grown man is dumb the grown man somehow is grown and does not know not to eat paint he somehow has a job even though he is this dumb he acts like a child when called out by an authority figure he denies his actions even though the evidence is literally on his face this seems like a very tropey character it seems like the character is a dumb man child this just so happens to be a very popular trope in fiction see here http tvtropes org pmwiki pmwiki php main manchild so yes the joke does stand on its own through context clues you are either willfully ignoring those observations and natural assumptions or do not have the ability to notice those subtle changes in peoples behavior ,8,funny
Aegisth,no it because you are obviously missing the point of what makes the joke funny and trying to rationalize we all know that he should have been able to taste it and know that there was paint it should have been obvious but the character is stupid enough overall that he ate them anyway maybe not realizing it was poisonous why he ate them does not really matter the point is you are intentionally not suspending your disbelief for the sake of the joke fiction has a consistent need for suspension of disbelief to make things funny or interesting for the sake of the narrative your point that this does not even make sense ignores this unspoken rule about fiction and it makes you come across as kind of an asshole you should realize that other people already get your point and are suspending their disbelief for the sake of comedy but you are stating it as if no one does and that they are dumb for not understanding why the character actions make no sense we get that the character should have known the paint was toxic and that the m ms were painted that the joke edit additionally the phrase you must be fun at parties is used because most people have been at a gathering where someone points out why a joke is not technically funny and ruins the humor of the situation it like if someone asked the why did the chicken cross the road joke and you chimed in and said well chickens do not really have the brain capacity to make the distinction between road and field so it was probably random that it crossed the road stating that 1 ruins the joke 2 insults the intelligence of the people around you and 3 makes it clear that you are not understanding the unspoken norms of the situation most people sum this point up to you must be fun at parties as a way to sarcastically point out that you ignore social norms and make a situation uncomfortable or awkward let me know if you need me to explain any other unspoken social norms to you i would be happy to ,14,funny

Aegisth,no he does not have magic from the get go he found a wizard book and knew how to read it and the diagrams and explanations for some reason made sense to him where nothing else had really in his life he got things but only basically magic written down makes sense to him why who the fuck knows the god of magic decided to bestow the gift onto him i really do not understand your reasoning beyond i do not like it ,6,dndnext
Aegisth,what if his backstory worked in why he could comprehend magic the half orc is dim witted overall but things just click for him when it comes to magic he not good at it but he understands it unlike anything he every done before in his life it just makes sense to him that not a far fetched character concept by any means additionally i do not understand why you have to downvote me i am not attacking you here ,7,dndnext
Aegisth,i mean if the player can come up with a reason why not what is the harm if i want to play a ridiculously stupid half orc wizard how does it hurt the game as a whole ,3,dndnext

Aegisth,but doomsday has no way of propelling himself in space yeah it gives buu more time to regain stamina before starting the fight again ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,except we see mr buu get beaten by just raw strength of kid buu eventually mr buu regeneration did fail ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,it really a question of whether or not buu could end up absorbing doomsday if not this very well might be a stalemate buu can get tired and his regeneration can eventually fail as we have seen from mr buu fight with kid buu however kid buu has a much larger energy reserve than mr buu so it will take a lot longer if buu tries and fails to absorb doomsday i could see him just blowing up the planet in frustration that would give buu time enough to recover that this would most likely end in a stalemate the other simply cannot put out enough power in a short enough time to put the other down ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,how does regeneration affect his strength ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,since pure evil buu has the same amount of ki is kid buu i would say pure evil buu wins pretty handily kid buu was an even match to ssj3 goku ,3,whowouldwin
Aegisth, holy shit this is still going on they never said the rating was based on strength you say this as if this has been a discussion for months now it hardly been a week calm yourself ,4,dbz
Aegisth,i did not mean skimming for its intended purpose i meant skimming for the ability to imprison a being in an endless void of a dimension that how it hax worthy in my mind ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,fair i do not actually know the ladder well enough but you had mentioned that balefire is the only real hax wot has while skimming platform dimension is another that is useful it just outclassed by balefire most of the time ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,keep in mind that rand still has the ability to open a skimming platform and knocking someone into the void that still a win by incap ,12,whowouldwin
Aegisth,there no social issue to people wanting to see gohan fight instead of study ,2,dbz
Aegisth,man it seems like keeping track of the fact that our city has been around for 56 347 days is a bit tedious if only we could define every 1000 days as something then we would only have 56 somethings instead i wonder what we should name it years sounds pretty useful there an inherent reasoning to a grouping of large numbers convenience we could do all of our measuring in meters technically but we created kilometers for ease of us ,4,space
Aegisth,i mean knowing how many years have passed is useful for more reasons than the seasons while on earth or are you talking about it if life developed naturally there ,4,space

Aegisth,what have i done ,1,gaming
Aegisth,no the burden of evidence is not on me it is on the person making the claims ,3,todayilearned
Aegisth, yes but if they can become a super saiyan logcially they could become a super saiyan 2 if they keep pushing it as they are twin universes it logical to assume that if goku and vegeta or other saiyans can reach ssj 1 3 and god the saiyans in u6 can as well frost is of the same species and obvious mutant powers as freeza so why can you assume that for saiyans and not for frost ,2,dbz
Aegisth, we already know they cannot at least before because they had no idea what super saiyan was there a difference between cannot meaning the inability to do so and do not know how to we also do know that they can as cabba did it during the u6 tournament with the help of vegeta he went ssj1 i referenced ssj2 ,1,dbz
Aegisth,why if frost is the equivalent to freeza for u6 and freeza was able to go from less than ssj1 to greater than ssb in 3 months why could not frost manage a similar feat narratively it obvious they are like the same thing ,1,dbz
Aegisth,using the same logic of your argument we cannot assume that the saiyans in u6 can go super saiyan 2 or 3 it pretty clear that we can assume that they can ,1,dbz
Aegisth,except it pretty ridiculously clear that frost is supposed to be almost exactly like freeza same transformations same natural battle power same desire to use dirty tricks it all the same there is no freeza of u6 no shit it two different places that has the same races and planets but different and or similar characters it explained that they are sibling universes it entirely possible that freeza was never born but a mutant frost demon was born that being frost ignoring the obvious similarities is more assumption on your part than believing frost has the same potential as freeza is on mine it all just speculation at this point again no shit i am not an idiot ,-1,dbz
Aegisth,except your basis of argument is that freeza is a mutant and super powerful except that line was only used to describe freeza because of his natural strength without the need to train not because of his ability to grow stronger so quickly freeza is a mutant and has super strength naturally frost is a mutant has has super strength naturally there no reason we cannot assume that frost has the same abilities as freeza since almost everything about him is the same as freeza he has the same extra transformations that natural battle power the same use of dirty tricks it would be dumb not to assume he could get stronger ,0,dbz
Aegisth,except he a very clear analogue to freeza in fact he much stronger than final form freeza was on namek there is not a large leap in logic to assume he the freeza of u6 ,0,dbz
Aegisth,obviously considering freeza was considered a freak only when he was moderately weaker than namek ssj goku frost is much stronger than that ,1,dbz
Aegisth, sigh freeza mutant battle power was referenced when he was only moderately weaker than super saiyan goku the fact that frost easily surpasses a super saiyan and one much stronger than goku on namek at that shows that he also possesses the mutant battle power that freeza has ,2,dbz
Aegisth,have sources on those claims there ,4,todayilearned
Aegisth,gba metroid is some of tbe best the series has to offer ,3,Metroid
Aegisth,he fought against a super saiyan ,2,dbz
Aegisth,keep in mind that there are going to be culturual differences between the two terms in english and japanese for example wizard in english is not used in a serious manner when we picture a wizard we see something silly wizards in japan are seen more like a dark sorcerer is seen here so toriyama only messed up in regards to american culture and the term could have been entirely appropriate in japanese culture ,1,dbz
Aegisth,kai is the original dbz with much of the in episode filler removed much better experience ,1,dbz
Aegisth,remember frost would only need to train for 3 months to become god level strength ,18,dbz

Aegisth,personally no what are you implying this is a distraction from ,1,The_Donald
Aegisth, i guess you are just posting this supposed gotcha question all over the place i am not they are honest questions that i want to understand we have not heard anything from the administration and i want to know what is going on being concerned is not the same as attacking trump maybe we think the current administration making unwarranted hostile actions towards a major power two weeks before trump takes office deserves undermining i undersatnd the frustration my point was that both acts are bad for the country as a whole the obama administration doing that is bad for the country the trump administration making claims for the us government before taking power is also bad for the country to give him plausible deniability i do not know why the vice president needs plausible deniability he did not do anything wrong i value transparent government and seeing a lack of that in the trump administration worries me why do you need me to come up with readily available and perfectly plausible positive answers it has to be because you are not trying to come up with them on your own i am not looking for others to come up with the answers i can ask these questions of the trump administration without attacking them i am not trying to attack i am trying to understand try to at least identify plausible positive interpretations of trump actions while you are here like i did above we are not here to bring down trump or concern troll him not trying to troll man you are assuming the worst in me here i come here to see the defense of trump because it is the only place that i can find one i can respect that and i understand why you would feel that way it a weird comparison but i understand this from the fighting game community people need a safe space to feel comfortable to talk about their views without getting attacked never meant to attack you ,1,The_Donald
Aegisth,all i have been saying are what actually happened though i have been asking questions on why it happened sure but could you point me to the comments where i sound like a dick because i have not been calling people names ignoring their points entirely or acting like they are dumb you are the first person to even imply i sound like a dick so i am kinda surprised ,1,The_Donald

Aegisth,what does pede mean and them is a gender neutral way to talk about someone by the way ,1,The_Donald
Aegisth,what the hell does this even mean ,1,The_Donald
Aegisth, i dunno what is going to happen but we have an intelligence community operating outside the law brazenly in fact in full view of the public and at the same time using the law to hamstring trump is it confirmed that the intelligence agencies have broken the law can you provide a source for that if it is as bad as it looks trump will have to take a hatchet to the ic and seriously seriously purge those that are not loyal to him it looking more and more like he has no choice his presidency and even his personal safety may be on the line here purging everyone not loyal to him is not in standing with a democratized nation in fact that type of language is incredibly scary slipper slope usually is not a good argument but we see in other countries both modern day and historical how purging the opposition goes for the citizens of the country tbh this is the most stressed i have felt regarding politics in my life even moreso than the ridiculous election season of last year this could end with bloodshed or even assassinations i do not think people really grasp the seriousness of what is going on i do have the same fear but our reasons for the fear are very different i fear that our administration may have members that are in line with the russians i also fear that the intelligence agencies do not trust the white house and are starting to act on their own the ic is pulling that shit here now and it terrifying actually i need sources for this ,1,The_Donald
Aegisth,it is yes but who in their right mind would put that as a video title and not expect backlash ,2,The_Donald
Aegisth,disclaimer i am for women being able to have abortion and it all consensual this is where i believe most pro life people hit the roadblock they believe that an abortion is never consensual it does not have the consent of the child being aborted it important to remember the other side are not full of monsters and demons they are people and they have reasons that are not always ridiculous ,1,TwoXChromosomes
Aegisth, it not good for an outgoing president to piss all over foreign policy as retaliation for election results i agree it not good for the intelligence community to conspire against the sitting government true we are through the looking glass now normal rules of engagement are out the window and this is not the fault of trump his hand has been forced no trump may have been put into a shit position but that does not give him or his administration the right to break the law by the way i have not been downvoting you not sure who it is that is downvoting you i wish they were not ,9,The_Donald
Aegisth,it still not good for the country for a civilian to make claims for the usa before they take office it does not matter if the sanctions were put in place for a terrible reason you do not do that for very good reason ,5,The_Donald
Aegisth,you are the only one on this sub so far that i have not had a decent conversation with please if you actually care to have a conversation instead of participating in the circlejerk tell me why i am wrong in my previous comment ,2,The_Donald
Aegisth, i have also seen theories being thrown around that flynn potentially agreed to be used as a sacrificial lamb in order to flush out and expose trump enemies in the intelligence community or that trump had learned that flynn had potentially been compromised with ties to turkey and used this as a convenient excuse to remove him without much fuss sorry dude but both of these sound like straight conspiracy theories no evidence on either of these in anyway there a possibility it was a legit mistake sure it still does not explain why 6 hours before the resignation the administration was saying that trump still had full trust in flynn why did the administration wait weeks before doing anything about his apparent mistake there a chance it was a mistake sure i will give you that but i do not really put that level of trust in any politician i do not see why i should give that to flynn ,3,The_Donald
Aegisth,i mean his video was literally titled death to all jews ,6,The_Donald
Aegisth,except trump has known about this for weeks it was only after it became public knowledge that flynn resigned why ,2,The_Donald
Aegisth,i mean he resigned on his own no one forced him to do so he also lied to the vice president about what he talked about and lied to the public about it while i might agree that making a big deal out of this would be hypocritical and just attacking trump those two facts makes it seem odd if it really was not that big of a deal why did flynn lie to the vice president lie to the public immediately resign once it became public knowledge that he had the conversation i am not putting anything on flynn i am just looking at his own actions and questioning his motives and actions if this has been a media witch hunt for his resignation i would agree with you more it really was not flynn resigned within hours of nyt breaking the story there was not time for a witch hunt ,3,The_Donald
Aegisth,i am not defending the op content i am saying that if you are the type of person on this subreddit it not a community i am a fan of this is opinionated crap that is not about builds in any way shape or form r 3d6 is supposed to be above crap posts like this you are just rude i was only vaguely interested in the sub the lack of content turned me off initially and then seeing your post made me go eh this sub is not worth it ,0,3d6
Aegisth,i was not saying that flynn was talking about lifting sanctions before he took office the sentence was meant to convey that flynn was talking about sanctions before trump was sworn into office not that flynn was saying the usa would lift sanctions before trump took office sorry for the confusion regardless flynn talking about the possibility of lifting sanctions undermines that current administration at the time of the conversation he also lied to the vice president and to the media about the conversation ,3,The_Donald
Aegisth,except if trump administration is saying oh yeah the sanctions are getting lifted once we get in and the obama administration was trying to strongarm russia into something with the sanctions it undermines america strength as a whole you may dislike obama but giving a foreign party leave to ignore demands made by the current administration is not in the best interested of the country additionally you did not address the two last questions i asked ,5,The_Donald
Aegisth,from what i understand the issue stems from flynn talking about lifting russian sanctions he then did not tell the vice president that the discussion about lifting russian sanctions happened and lied about it to the press afterwards i am talking with another redditor now and while talking with the russian ambassador before being sworn in may not have been practically incorrect other administrations have done it before apparently idk i am confirming lying to the vice president and publicly stating that there were no talks about russian sanctions is not something we want a national security advisor to do ,18,The_Donald
Aegisth,how did those meetings differ from what is going on with flynn as it stands it seems that flynn was talking about lifting russian sanctions before trump was sworn in did previous talks from previous administrations include discussion about specific policy change that would happen i do not know additionally why did flynn not tell the vice president why did the trump administration sit on this for weeks and only have flynn resign once it became public knowledge ,12,The_Donald

Aegisth,so do i but i made it a conscious effort for a while to stop that line of thought shit 10 years 10 years without getting drunk what the fuck was an early line of thought that terrified me i would force myself to stop and think not 10 years today i just wo not drink today and that entirely fine and i stayed consistent with that now the 10 years does not terrify me so much but i still think one day at a time one encounter at a time it helps a lot ,3,stopdrinking

Aegisth,you misunderstand fox and falco are the best yes but their meta changes in mvc3 there is a combination with the best characters that you always do it the best way to use the character and there no reason to change it it works once you hit an opponent it is an endless combo that only stops if the player misses the input in melee while fox and falco are the best they are still changing the way fox is played has changed significantly in the past 2 years and new tech is still being discovered mvc3 is solved for top level play melee is not and regardless fox and falco may be the best but a peach main is 1 and a jigglypuff main is 2 obviously if fox and falco are the best that means the meta still has much more room to change in order to become solved that the key difference between mvc3 and melee ,5,Games

Aegisth,re read my original comment man all i said was this joke was out of place and that i feel bad for m2k ,0,smashbros
Aegisth,like giants in storm king thunder ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,why is it op ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,there is in 5e the grapple check is an athletics check which means roll a d20 add your strength and your proficiency if you succeed the opponent is grappled the grappled status just means that someone being grappled has 0 movement they can still attack but certain weapons like a greatsword would not work now if you want to do a full nelson that more specific and not specifially in the rules 5e goes with the design philosophy that let the dm and players work out some things while we give guidance for a full nelson most dm would have you just roll 2 athletics checks 1 for the grapple 1 for the full nelson if you pass both they are in a full nelson if you fail the first nothing happens if you pass the first but fail the second they are grappled but not full nelson would compare this to 3e and pathfinder the grapple rules were legitimately an entire page of rules and specific scenario 5e is much much simpler ,2,funny
Aegisth,again 5e is simple by design if you and your dm dislike the rule make it a skill check which is in the rules to get someone into a full nelson it not that difficult ,2,funny
Aegisth,i mean 5e was made to be simple and allow the dm to make choices on their own it worse if they specify every single thing in a complete non dm decision based ruleset we would need separate rules for full nelson half nelson pin armbar straddle pin arms pin legs like 5e instead says some of these are grapple and some are pins more importantly the dm decides and even then if my player goes i want to try and get them in a full nelson the dm can just say sure give me two athletics checks one for the grapple and one for the full nelson that not complicated at all ,3,funny
Aegisth, but it is impossible to put someone in a choke hold and strangle them out this changes based on the dm but pinning them will do this you can grapple them and then pin them while holding your mouth over their nose and mouth or around their neck this is how my dm handles it or full nelson then and let someone else take shots this is straight up just a grapple though that and getting punched by a giant does damn near the same damage as getting punched by a pixie it will do an extra d6 at the least most giants will have at least 25 strength so it will do an extra 1d6 7 plus the weapon damage not a lot but it there additionally it up to the dm here that 5e design philosophy simple and the dm can add things if they want a gnome with a sword against a metal golem does the same damage as a shot against an infant mechanically sure but the infant is going to die no matter what they get attacked with ,2,funny
Aegisth,lol this is great looks like a lot of fun ,1,funny
Aegisth,you can shove them during before the grapple and they will then be prone and grappled you can then take unarmed attacks against them advantage additionally you can pin them but it a stupid thing grapple and prone let others tie someone up for you pretty easily ,5,funny
Aegisth,you better hope your lightning bolts are doing more than 2 damage ,1,funny
Aegisth,yeah this was out of place even as a big hbox fan edit at 14 because i feel bad for m2k this sub has some really weird circle jerks around hbox edit 29 i wonder how much further the subreddit can circlejerk me down further ,-43,smashbros

Aegisth, the purpose of aa in practice in the eyes of a neutral observer is to keep you in aa for life this is a loaded sentence when said on reddit redditors as a whole believe that every organization is corrupt and out to fuck you as hard as they can as soon as they can they do not care about you or anyone aa is not a corporation it a loosely held together set of local groups that spans the world aa does not get any money out of you unless you want to give a dollar or two at a meeting and while they do want you to stay in aa it not to rob you your sentence to a casual redditor will seem like that you make it sound like a cult like scientology it not they have their dogma yeah but many do it because they believe it works they do not ask for anything more than for your presence and for you to try and be honest i cannot think of the actual word but your statement puts a spin on aa that either makes it sound like a dangerous cult or corporate swine either one designed to rob you of your money and freedom that not aa ,1,explainlikeimfive
Aegisth,it doesnt invalidate aa its frustrating how many redditors shit on aa and say its a crock of shit aa are griups of people trying to help each other best they can they helped me when i needed to know that others were struggling with what i was struggling with and i dislike the dogma as well and stopped going because of it i found other sources that helped me its free its anonymous its widespread the people care free coffee and snacks its a good thing and very frustrating to hear people shit on it ,3,explainlikeimfive
Aegisth,you really obviously do not know anything about aa ,2,explainlikeimfive
Aegisth,i mean the big book directly talks avout atheism and agnosticism ,1,explainlikeimfive
Aegisth,damn it impressive and kinda intimidating 30 years you have been doing this since before i was born ,4,stopdrinking
Aegisth,yep at least you can admit that out loud try and learn as much as you can about our problem it will help you make your decision ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,also i do not think of it as brave personally i was desperate and scared ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,they do try to evolve but it all the same tricks so far the tricky thought patterns remain pretty similar in the sense that they try to find any excuse no matter how small and ridiculous to justify having the drink again and thanks i cannot see your days at the moment for some reason ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,perhaps sobriety is different for everyone but being truly honest with myself was key because it allowed me to make plans to sabotage myself when i tried to drink it took many many months before i was able to and it was honestly a moment of desperation and fear that got me to do it i would woken up on father day 2016 hands slightly shaking feeling like shit alone in my apartment i would sat in the shower for an hour the last night feeling like shit lonely crying and depressed i was lost and was just done i needed someone to help me until that point i had not known exactly what the phrase are ach out for help was when i reached out it because i honestly needed someone to help i needed someone to do things for me and take care of me while i was broken i needed someone to look out for me when i could not look out for myself i was broken after that the cat was out of the bag i would admitted it and i knew if i went back on it at that point i would only disappoint and alienate myself from my family so what was more important to me my family or the bottle i could walk and get around the corner that when i decided to go all the way it took time and i did it over the course of 2 weeks but i admitted and explained and as i learned i let others know what i learned thankfully people were wonderfully supportive of me there were judgments but once i explained alcoholism and what it does people understand and were proud of me are proud of me and after a while i have started to become proud of me and the shame went away month by month it worth it friend i needed to think truly about why i was not telling anyone about it it was because i was ashamed i was scared that i would not be able to drink anymore i wanted to continue to slowly die because i could do that day by day and just not have to care and after a while that small voice that was ashamed screamed out and took control and reached out to someone that could help and that small voice is now me as i am now and i am happy for that ,2,stopdrinking
Aegisth,this bothered me for a long time but i have come to understand it in time i can never sit down and have alcohol again if i started to drink again i would fall back into my self destructive habits this is a fact i can fall back into when i have the urge to drink again i can think no beacuse this will end up happening it gives me a clear reason to fight back against the insanity ,2,stopdrinking
Aegisth,when i was relapsing i was doing it alone i needed to be entirely honest with myself during my sober moments and work out a plan that sabotaged my drunk self i had to take the plunge into sobriety and use my own weaknesses against me to make that happen i told everyone i cared about that i was not drinking anymore i have a problem with alcohol the amount i would been drinking i also moved closer to family started being more social once i learned told everyone about the insanity told everyone that if i started drinking again do not believe me when i say nah i have it under control i do not when i was going out i would tell someone i trusted the problem and to keep an eye on me usually just the idea of disappointing them was enough to give me those minutes of rethinking the situation overall i care a lot about what others think about me my loved ones my friends i was as open as possible and as honest because i knew then i could not hide anymore drunk me would always try to hide behind excuses and walls sober me sabotaged that by breaking down every single wall that i could so that drunk me could not hide anymore i shone a spotlight on my alcoholism and let people know that i needed help fixing this sad depressed self destructive person that i harbored within me ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth, these are dangerous sneaky thoughts they are it the insanity speaking ,2,stopdrinking
Aegisth,thanks i appreciate it ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,it interesting i have had those moments of insanity through these 7 months and at the time they made so much sense but when i read yours while in a good mindset i can see the insanity my thoughts as i read it if you do not like beer why are you drinking it you have had plenty of times where you tell people you do not drink why is this different why this date it sounds like you are giving yourself a convenient excuse it kind of refreshing the insanity is pretty consistently insane at least it predictable ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,finding a group of people that had been going through the same thing as me helped a lot actually during my early recovery knowing there are others that go through this every day and that there are even more that have not found help helped me quite a bit it gave me strength ,1,stopdrinking

Aegisth, not a fan of smash being at evo at all why ,1,Games
Aegisth,i am glad you shared this ,1,AskReddit
Aegisth,it sounds like when i am in a dream and simply believe things because that how they are ,1,AskReddit
Aegisth, all i know of are the movies and the books yep they contradict each other at times and the movies leave a bunch out you are getting a little off track i am not we are having a discussion about canon you refuse to accept its existence i am telling you that you are refuting a basic premise in literature the only time it becomes a problem is when someone is told how to watch enjoy the show i have never said you cannot enjoy non canon but if someone wants to know the full story they will become more confused if you tell them oh yeah janemba happened because it makes no sense tell them yeah the movies do not fit into the main story of dbz but they are awesome and you should watch them ,3,dbz
Aegisth,okay let take another example harry potter would you say that the books are the main source of canon because no one has ever said straight on that they are they do not say the books are the main source of truth and nothing else because it implied or how about spiderman there are multiple series of spiderman with their own canons what happens in ultimate spiderman did not happen in spectacular spiderman and vice versa no one specifically states this it a given you are arguing against a given implied fact about literature as a whole do you honestly believe the concept of canon overall does not exist because if so you are insane and if you are not you are just cherry picking out dbz with no argument except but i do not want to follow canon ,3,dbz
Aegisth,look you can go ahead and believe that whatever you want to believe is true that your opinion defines what the series does but when you are talking to someone and you say that janemba happened and it real and the other person says uh no it did not it makes no sense for it to happen you are going to be wrong you can enjoy it but you will be wrong ,3,dbz
Aegisth,nobody says you are wrong for enjoying filler or non canon things we can state that a certain sequence of events are what really happened but turn around and then say but yo fusion reborn is so cool and entirely enjoy it ,5,dbz
Aegisth, the idea that there has to be an official canon that everything fits into is why we get those questions over and over and it just adds excess stress to watching the show if anything we get those questions because things do not make any sense if everything happened freeza being in his own personal hell and freeza being in anime hell literally cannot happen at the same time filler non canon stuff is essentially really good fanfiction while we are on it why do not we jump over to fanfiction com and pull some of the better stories from there we can consider them to have happened as well because canon does not matter right ,4,dbz
Aegisth,because then we have shit like why was freeza surprised that goku killed buu when during goku fight with kid buu we see freeza watching the final fight how is future trunks present when they fight bojack since he left right after perfect cell when does janemba happen vegeta comes back to life after kid buu but the movie is also clearly after kid buu did vegeta die again why do they never mention garlic jr again you know the answer to the all of these questions the inconsistencies are because none of them happened in the main series there is no broly janemba garlic jr or bojack they do not exist i enjoy each one of these but that does not mean it instantly becomes canon i do not care what some random writer at toei wanted to be part of dbz or dbs with their filler i care about what toriyama wrote for db and dbz that the manga you are ignoring that fact because you are part of the circlejerk of there is no canon there is ,7,dbz
Aegisth,that is true ,1,dbz
Aegisth, you are being purposefully dense ,5,dbz
Aegisth,we like to know what actually happened ,3,dbz
Aegisth,also important to note that toriyama considers toyotaro an appropriate successor for db ,-3,dbz
Aegisth, if you could even call it that uhhh have you seen the fight he not only moved faster than frost could react he blocked every single one of frost punches with one hand and dodges a barrage of death beams piccolo did not do poorly in that fight in any capacity ,2,dbz
Aegisth,regardless based on scaling piccolo would be at least as strong as ssj3 gotenks goku and vegeta bases are about the same vegeta base is stronger than ssj3 gotenks by far the fact that piccolo could hold his own against someone that held their own against goku ssj1 goku no less means piccolo must also be ssj3 gotenks level this is why the anime is annoying it makes literally zero sense ,2,dbz
Aegisth,i did not really share my opinion on their reasoning just that it was in fact a retcon ,1,dbz
Aegisth,because elder kai states these earrings have no time limit unlike the fusion dance he states it pretty clearly we are led to trust this character because he is the leader of the entire universe what we are led to believe was later shown to be wrong it was however correct for many years it a retcon the definition of retcon in a film television series or other fictional work a piece of new information that imposes a different interpretation on previously described events typically used to facilitate a dramatic plot shift or account for an inconsistency so yeah by definition it a retcon ,9,dbz
Aegisth, yet vegito still defused yes because of the evil magics within buu elder kai did not know that because they never saw mortals fuse with the earrings yes that why it a retcon and a dumb one at that ,2,dbz
Aegisth,except he was not weaker i do not care what goku said if goku said piccolo cannot run 50m in 6 seconds and piccolo did run 50m in 6 seconds i will believe what i see goku was wrong in this case goku was wrong ,1,dbz
Aegisth,except it also put into question many of the things elder kai ever told us ,9,dbz
Aegisth,because it was determined in dbz that there was no time limit elder kai straight told us that it was a retcon entirely just because vegito defused for some reason does not mean it was due to time limit we know that now but the wisest being in the entire universe at the time told us that there was no time limit it a retcon ,9,dbz
Aegisth,oh lord let go through this fight minute by minute then piccolo dodges the first strike and moves fast enough in the air that frost cannot track him piccolo dodges multiple death beams while charging his attack fires his own beams that frost easily counter attacks with ki attacks dodges a barrage of death beams before getting hit in the thigh and falling creates clones a technique we know splits his power by the amount of clones we see this in db frost blasts a bunch of them away with death beams frost destroys the rest with an aoe piccolo blocks all of frost attacks with one hand piccolo gets hit with a hit to his to the leg stunning him piccolo manages to hold frost in place with one arm so yes piccollo clearly shows that 1 he is fast enough to dodge a majority of frost strikes and ki attacks 2 is strong enough to hold forst in place with one arm and 3 has enough endurance to tank a few of frost blows if frost was as strong as ssj3 gotenks piccolo would have been one shot we see that the jump in power from third from freeza to final form freeza was enough that piccolo could not even see freeza death beams let alone dodge them when someone is significantly stronger their opponent puts up absolutely no fight we see this time and time again within db ,2,dbz
Aegisth,all of those are techniques that have special properties yes piccolo used nothing like that he was using normal beam techniques if piccolo had used the solar flare destructo disc stopped time pulled a clone out of his ass or used the kaoiken then sure i would give it to you he did not all of his attacks were pretty standard beam attacks that he used ,2,dbz
Aegisth, he used special moves to keeping frost on his toes in every other instance in the series except for the kikoho with tien and imperfect cell when someone is substantially weaker than their opponent no pecial move works piccolo could not have taken a weaned freeza for instance by using pecial moves to keep him on his toes ,3,dbz
Aegisth,except piccolo very obviously held his own against frost regardless of what goku said and frost had to resort to using his poison to win goku in base can defeat ssj3 gotenks and piccolo is not stronger than that copy vegeta base could beat ssj3 gotenks we have no idea how the copy lifeform actually mimics a host power that scene is ridiculously stupid i wish it had never occurred unfortunately i have to live with the anime making literally no sense ,3,dbz
Aegisth,i have multiple times any 100 i have tried speedrunning it a few times i want a new metroid in a new world that i have to explore and learn its layout find its secrets saying play the original when someone says i want a sequel is stupid ,5,Games

Aegisth, a persistent belief that you can impose structure on a universe that was never intended to have it what where does this idea come from it pretty clear cut the dragonball manga is canon for the majority of the series why because toriyama created them why do not we consider canon filler because it basically suped up fan fiction writers and animators at toei decided on what happened during the filler i do not care what they believed should happen in the series i care what toriyama put in it things get shaky with super sure but before that what is there to question ,1,dbz

Aegisth,why would she betray them when they are obviously working her plan for her think about the thordak fight raishan attacked thordak once and then spent the rest of the fight attacking wyvern she used absolutely zero resources and let vm take the brunt of thordak rage all she wanted was the corpse and an egg or two ancient green dragon she evil she almost commited genocide of an entire people i would not want to give her the corpse or the eggs either by their own dishonor and stupidity vm made it abundantly clear that they were going to kill her the first chance they got absolutely clear it may have been brash and not well thought out but it was not dishonorable raishan knew that vm would attack her and try and stop her why do you think she kept herself in tip top shape during the thordak fight those 7th and 8th level spells would have really helped against thordak why did not she use them why not meteor swarm thordak or use prismatic ray or any of the other spells she just used against vm the answer was she was saving them she knew vm would probably take out thordak and once they were softened up she could take them out it was only the arrival of the brass dragon that made her duck and run ,11,criticalrole

Aegisth,they could have sure but more than likely one of them would be dead if they had with keyleth on such low hp if she had been targeted by an attack and took a healing spell early in the fight they would not have had the spells to hear the entire party as it stands almost everyone is entirely out of spells if pike had used her last third level earlier in the fight for instance scanlan would be dead they might have won but it would have been a very serious risk to take they played it well enough ,14,criticalrole
Aegisth,she a green dragon betrayal and distrust is in their very nature the fact that she had you believing she was trustworthy just goes to show well matt rp would her she more of a force of nature than a person and she cannot betray that nature within her she would have attacked vox machina at the first opportunity ,14,criticalrole
Aegisth,the chat is really the worst part of critical role not a big fan of the community ,6,criticalrole
Aegisth,there a key difference between evil buu and kid buu evil buu cold calculated rational relentless he humiliates mr buu and turns him into chocolate he is pretty predictable in his fighting style kid buu insane unpredictable relentless he goes out of his way to destroy his own body and make the fight with goku more difficult i believe evil buu is the pure evil in buu as a being while kid buu is that evil being directed to destroy when fat buu ejected evil buu he kept the insanity part of kid buu for himself because it was not necessarily evil when mr buu was removed from super buu only the kai presence was removed the good parts kid buu during the fight with hercule spit out mr buu to remove the kai presence within him that presence did not want to hurt hercule that why we see a discrepancy while kid buu is evil he is not only evil other parts of him exist fat buu expelled all of his evil tendencies however and that was the bulk of his power kid buu is the original form of buu evil buu is the evil given form kid buu is a bit more than just evil ,5,dbz
Aegisth,except we see that trunks is able to become a super saiyan at a very young age in the future timeline he did it when he was 14 and that was only because he only had the help of gohan in our timeline trunks manages at 8 that even better than gohan and at that age trunks was about as powerful as vegeta and trunks were in the cell saga itself both trunks and goten as hybrids have extremely high power ,1,dbz
Aegisth,goku knew he got stronger after recovering from an injury yes he specifically hurt and healed himself over and over using almost all of the senzus in the process he might not have known it was a racial trait of saiyans called a zenkai but he used it nonetheless ,3,dbz
Aegisth,i mean he did point to bible verses for his sources not terrible ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, so comparing the manga to the anime i kind of thought the manga was a bit of bs trunks was just as strong as ssj3 in the anime as well though if he was like gohan where he a hybrid that gets insane power then sure i could believe it but it did not seem like that was the case he is a hybrid though ,4,dbz
Aegisth,i would move ,3,whowouldwin
Aegisth,the flood take personality memories experiences etc and combine them into one being the keymind of the flood although there are 3 it the same as if there 1 will have the memories experiences and combined personalities of all three of the people in op post ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,active camo gives off heat where is that mentioned additionally the elites have plenty of training in both avoiding ambushes and setting up ambushes for other beings they are not a bunch of children ,4,whowouldwin
Aegisth,what context you said that gohan uses his intelligence to move past ssj forms no where is that even implied gohan has a hidden potential in him that is a well of power elder kai tapped into that it had nothing to do with his intelligence you are the very first person i have ever seen think that his mystic form comes from his intelligence 3rd quote did you not watch the frieza or android saga did you because i seem to remember goku and vegeta gaining power in the android saga through planning vegeta achieved trunks super bulky form and discarded it as useless and kept with the ascended ssj form goku achieved the super bulky form and also discarded it instead he reasoned out that he should let his body become used to ssj and gain power through that goku and vegeta both recognized the need for masterful control of their ki for ssb goku recognized the saiyan zenkai and used it to become incredibly strong on his way to namek goku and vegeta are not muscle heads that only punch shit to get stronger they come up with techniques and new training methods to push themselves to their next limit i have 0 idea where you came up with the intelligence bit for gohan it referenced literally no where in the manga that mystic form has anything to do with his intelligence ,10,dbz
Aegisth,still a huge fan of ssj3 ,4,dbz
Aegisth, ssj levels anymore because of his intelligence what the elder kai was hinting at when the power was unlocked uh goku and vegeta only obtain their power thru brute force and will i am so confused where you are getting these notions ,21,dbz
Aegisth, u television525 has given some great evidence that trunks and goten are closer to perfect cell saga vegeta and trunks ,6,whowouldwin
Aegisth,he does not have to use cheating methods to kill the dragon he was saving charity at the time it could have been that the dragon was doing a ritual on charity and was therefore weaker because he had to maintain concentration on the spell like when lord wraith was doing the ritual bad luck curse and the three girls could not break their chant in that case michael would be well within his right to kill the beast and yet not be fighting a dragon at the height of his power he can still plan and attack an enemy weak points he does not go in blindly being a knight of the cross means you are honorable not that you are a straight idiot but the swords have been shown to allow their user to resist telekinetic forces akin to the force in the battle with the red court when it allowed murphy and co to shrug off the willpower of the red king and the lords of outer night at the very least vader would not be able to just force choke immediately and 10 10 this is true i have ceded this point to someone else i think i got a little caught up with what micheal theoretical limits and all that and that my mistake but going by feats as you said vader offensive force powers should not be able to directly affect him i still think vader would win with his precog and superior speed but it would not be a 10 10 instagib as many have been suggesting i agree michael could kill vader it possible his sword would do major damage to him i think but vader can create after images with how quickly he moves and with precog i do not know i just do not think he could manage it ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,i have gone over this with three people if you are going to make that argument it is just as valid to say that dresden is up to mab level of power because he killed the entire red court and wog says that the entire red court could take on mab herself rumor states that dresden killed the red court which he did but we know the specifics we know that he cannot kill all of the red court by himself and it was only circumstance that allowed him to do it michael has shown absolutely no feats showing he can 1 on 1 a dragon in fair combat at the height of the dragon power nothing he almost died from a few bullets he has to try and try hard to fight a denarius he has trouble with a handful of friggin red court vampires for crying out loud you cannot in an argument say his power scales to the edge of the white god power and expect that to happen in a battle against vader or anyone for that matter the white god has shown no indiciation of helping anyone out that much in fact the court of angels and the white god have shown a decidedly spectacular lack of direct intervention like that it a constant theme that they cannot intervene strongly with mortal affairs it does not happen you are only harping on one woc feat of michael killing a dragon for your argument in a series that throws around rumor of supernatural beings being more powerful than they are like it going out of style you believe one off the cuff line about the dragon take it at face value and believe michael is in that power range he not he cannot kill mab he cannot kill titania he cannot kill odin he not in that league and the series brings that up again and again you just ignore it ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,man i love this theme song ,6,dbz
Aegisth,oh yeah you are right no idea then ,1,dbz
Aegisth,i thought it was because of trunks dark shirt,4,dbz
Aegisth, his power scales theoretically into infinity yeah not continuing this conversation if you believe this this is the same argument people make for superman has no limits and saitama will always win because the author says so it lazy and brings down the quality of www drastically ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,fte movement does not always create after images michael has fought fte creatures yes but vader movement is on another level compared to them not in his running towards you speed he pretty average but in his reaction times and ability to move his lightsaber ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth, the white god just evens out things like supernatural speed evil powers etc i hate this type of reasoning it comes down to does the white god want michael to win if yes he wins against vader if no he does not it has no place in who would win it like the saitama argument of he will always win because that his power or the superman argument he has no limits because he written to have no limits those types of arguments do not belong in who would win we should only use what a character has actually done ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,oh yeah that fair dresden also does it to mother winter bindings later in the series in which case i would agree that the applications of force push and force choke would be lessened by the swords presence enough for michael to get within close range i do not think it would get rid of force precog though as that is explicitly not a dark side power of the force technically force push is not either since jedi use it all the time i still do not think michael could do it though vader is a casual bullet timer and is able to block multiple blaster bolts with his lightsaber with ease for instance michael has not shown anything as quick as this in his swordplay http imgur com xbzsq6v along with force precog i just do not see how michael can win this vader is simply too fast and has precog one hit from a lightsaber is going to take michael down as his armor is not going to be able to defend him ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth, with their willpower this is very different from the force though the force is a tangible force acting on you the red king power is a mental pressure keep in mind that the swords let micheal kill a dragon capital d who are by wog elemental forces of the cosmos in the more asian sense of the concept semi divine beings who were once given authority over various portions of the mortal universe and who were responsible for their orderly procession source i have argued this point over and over against people we have zero idea how that battle went down it basically hearsay it like how people are saying dresden killed the whole red court he did but it was not because of his own power it could be the same with michael on top of that it makes no sense for that to be the baseline of michael power were it the case he would have literally zero problem with any being weaker than mab and yet we see him struggle time and time again yes the sword can cancel out vader force powers it cannot your example is a mental effect that sword freed people from the force is a literal force acting on a person body ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,okay but michael has been injured and has had trouble fighting beings much weaker than mab he feels at a disadvantage in a room full of reds in book 3 even though he should have been able to take every single one on effortlessly if he had the power of mab with the sword out ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, the red king and the lords slam harry and his team with their power the pressure freezing them in place harry released bob who blocked that power enabling harry to move enough to cover murphy she drew fidelacchius and cut the will of the red king and the lords with a swipe of the blade through the air a huge battle broke out in the stadium the shear number of foes made things desperate when the grey council arrived 12 from what i remember based on this passage the red king power was a mental effect not physical dresden comments on this throughout the series looking into a red court vampire eyes causes one to freeze the red king eyes caused dresdsen to freeze as well and his presence stopped him from moving as well it was a mental thing the red developed as a way to stun their prey before feeding ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, the swords have feats for canceling out telekinesis as fidalacious sorry for the spelling i read the audiobooks did for murphy during the battle with the red court you are going to have to point out to me when this happened because i do not remember this at all this was at the end of changes leveling the playing field is exactly what the swords do typically yes but that does not mean a knight of the cross can go up against the devil himself and hope the sword levels the playing field it has limits i believe vader is above that limit ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, all of michael abilities go away without that and he actually even more restricted than a normal human except they do not but i just do not see any fair comparison with a knight of the cross if the black magic of a world is not tainted enough to trigger michael abilities his sword would still hurt vader it just would not take away vader strongest ability the force for instance white court vampires are evil when they feed on someone in the dresden universe amoracchias does not stop them from gaining power from their demon and yet michael can still fight them and i am sorry but but dragons is pretty damning here is what we know 1 micahel killed a dragon 2 dragons are on the same level as mab in terms of raw power 3 another dragon acknowledged michael kill 4 michael was unafraid of the second dragon but cautioned dresden to keep his mouth shut out of respect 5 michael would not like to fight the second dragon we have no idea what circumstances surrounded the dragon is there a way to take away their power temporarily did michael kill the dragon after it was already weak from fighting someone else did his sword actually weaken it like it does a denarian we have no idea you cannot use this as evidence because we have literally 0 idea what happened during that fight it not damning the denarians are supposed to be some of the strongest people to have ever lived he equipped to handle them his powers are specifically designed to fight the denarians that why they are so effective against them they are fallen angels it makes sense that the sword of the cross has power over them and it is explicitly stated in the series that the swords of the cross do have power over denarians that puts him equipped to handle people that harry is just barely catching up with now if he can bring that to bear it very hard to discount him even against vader like i said michael is not useless he could hurt vader if he could touch him but vader powers are too great and just because you want michael to win you cannot say oh the sword of the cross takes away the entire power set of vader because he uses it for dark purposes even though we see time and time again the the sword cannot do that to every evil creature it does not cause vampires to become frail and weak it does not cause evil ghosts to disappear from our realm it does none of these things because the swords of the cross are not a no dark forces here button they are specific counters to the denarians and are incredibly powerful when fighting dark creatures let put it this way deciding that the sword of the cross can take away any dark evil power is not a wortwhile r whowouldwin anyway if it were true i could say michael carpenter vs mab or michael carpenter vs every evil being ever created and he would always win he wo not because that not the power of the swords of the cross and we see that plainly throughout the series itself so i ask one more time provide evidence that michael would be able to take away the powers of any dark force which would include the dark side of the force provide evidence that he can deal with vader force choke and break away at all do not just say dragons or the knights of the cross are designed to fight evil and vader is evil so he will win that not evidence that conjecture ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,micahel walked fearlessly not because he was as powerful vader is one of the most powerful force users in the star wars universe the man can do this https giant gfycat com bluethirdalaskankleekai webm dresden on his best day with hellfire was able to flip a damn card over with his spells this is leagues above anything we have see michael deal with he is not strong enough to get out of a force choke and we have no evidence to suggest that the force is enough of a dark force to for amoracchius to stop it you need to provide actual evidence that michael could do anything against vader powers as it stands you have provided nothing except but dragons ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,and yet we still do not know what happened in the battle the entire red court could take on mab from the author and yet we know that dresden is not capable of doing it himself just because dresden killed the red court does not mean he is stronger than them all in the same way just because michael killed a dragon does not mean he is as strong ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, except that michael was taken seriously when he used that fact to threaten another dragon in the same way that dresden would be taken seriously by supernatural beings stronger than him michael kill of the dragon has no feats associated with it we do not know exactly what went down ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,we have literally no idea what a dragon is capable of or the circumstances of michael battle with the dragon the dresden files has a huge theme surrounding rumor of an individual battle for instance people are talking about dresden as if he single handedly wiped out the entire red court just because he could except we all know dresden cannot do that he was in a very opportune place at a very opportune time and he took advantage dresden himself is not that powerful michael battle with the dragon could be much the same in fact we know this is true because michael has had trouble with regular denarius in the past if he can kill a reality warping physical god one step below an arch angel why does he have trouble with more normal supernatural things answer the phrase he killed a dragon does not actually describe the whole situation michael is powerful when holding amoracchius yes he is not a physical god slayer whenever he feels like it ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,i do not really see how michael can win here force precog force choke force lightning the force is just too powerful really ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,i really do not see how amoracchius would stop his force powers it the dark side of the force yes but the light from amoracchius does not stop all dark things in the dresden universe just some ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,do you know anywhere we can get more of him ,2,rule34
Aegisth, but it has not i do not see how this point can stand if you are creating a whole new situation if dbz was released this way there would be loads of other changes buu saga would have probably finished today i am saying it unfair to say that we cannot compare bra character development to vegeta because dbm is released more slowly than dbz was it has nothing to do with the quality of the writing and all to do with your impatience as a reader you were saying that senzu beans do not erase memories of being beaten to a pulp i am saying that she did not seem to care at all after eating that bean she may have seemed fine sure but she still felt all of that pain just because she does not react with fear and discouragement does not mean she wo not remember those moments and strongly dislike them fair enough but i am not sure at this point about what saligar is planning remember the whole mystic raditz i am still waiting to hear that one okay again i do not see a flaw in saligar writing or character development at all saligar is releasing this fan manga for free and has his own life it exceptionally high quality i do not see why you consider it poor because he does not jump on every plot line as soon as he introduces it ,1,dbz
Aegisth, i understand that it not i am just saying that you cannot really use the years for vegeta to develop because if they wanted to do that in multiverse character development would take centuries the same could be said of dbz if it had been released at 2 3 pages a week comparing to vegeta is an incredibly fair comparison that fair enough i understand but when she got back in her body she did not really say do anything to indicate trauma or that the events really hit her and also when she took that senzu bean she got back up fine and dandy just like everyone did in z it been literal seconds since she was put back in her body she surprised and relieved and also when she took that senzu bean she got back up fine and dandy just like everyone did in z yeah i do not understand how this disagrees with anything i have said ,1,dbz
Aegisth,me no i do not have any opponents but a bratty teenage girl hell yeah have you talked to a teenager girl recently that a pretty common expression ,1,dbz
Aegisth, fair but it taken literal years for these 4 days to happen yeah that not on salagir as a writer it a perfectly reasonable character arc for bra the community is simply impatient i would not count this one too much because she brought senzu beans with her kind of contradicts her character imo to the fight in z whenever someone having an emotional beatdown they do not normally get a senzu bean and finish off their opponent right there right then also the thing is i see what you are saiyan about pan gohan and veggeto but those are other characters and i am talking about how bra is directly affected by these events senzu beans do not erase the memory of having your body turned into a jumble of broken bones and burst organs we do not know how bra is affected by these events it been literal minutes since her fight ended ,1,dbz
Aegisth, during which bra knew damn well she had no chance of dying so she probably did not care whatsoever it also has not made her any less of an annoying arrogant character it literally been only a few minutes since her fight ended i am glad you are able to see into the future additionally whether or not you know you can heal yourself does not stop the pain from several dozen punches from a being near the level of perfect cell power she looked broken and bloodied and her life force was so shot down that it took a concentrated effort from uub to see she was alive that shit hurts and it still a punishment for arrogance she does not have to die to be punished you have got to be joking right the way she was talking to vegetto after she was switched back clearly implies she knew he would get the job done she trusts her father to save her sure but that does not mean she knew for sure she had no idea what ginyu would do in her body even the most confident person would feel fear in that situation it natural she still a teenage girl the difference between vegeta and bra is that vegeta constantly gets shot down for his arrogance whereas bra has yet to be vegeta was also getting steady development which bra is not getting it took vegeta over half a decade before he became a reasonable person half a decade he had the shit beaten out of him multiple times was killed watched his rival and rival son become stronger than him have his own son die and have to be protected like a child by his rival son before he even began to change and even after all of that vegeta in a fit of childish frustration killed thousands of people to goad goku into fighting him vegeta did not grow up or change quickly in any sense of the word he remained a stubborn arrogant psychopathic maniac for most of his life and it was only after his suicidal attack failed and he learned that buu still killed or absorbed his entire family that he changed even after all that he still an ass 10 years have passed since we have known him in character and vegeta is still vegeta bra on the other hand is still a 16 year old girl and she has had 4 days to grow from her mistakes how do you expect a teenage girl to change in 4 days of mistakes after a lifetime of being the second most powerful being in the universe you either show a distinct lack of understanding of vegeta character or you refuse to acknowledge that bra is just as annoying as most 16 year old girls are she perfectly normal for her age ,1,dbz
Aegisth,and we have seen bra hurt for her brash actions too 1 she went ssj2 and nearly killed her father and brother 2 she got the ever living shit beaten out of her by cold enough of a beating that vegetto and gohan were fighting to keep their expressions stoic and pan was openly gaping in horror 3 she had her body switched by ginyu and was forced to feel the fear of not knowing if she would ever make it back to her original form all of these things should change her personality in the future but right now it been 4 days since the tournament started a brash arrogant confident teenage girl does not change her entire attitude at a public tournament in 4 days it took vegeta years before he finally calmed down and stopped being a douche bag bra behavior is entirely appropriate for her age power and life so far the community is just a giant echo chamber ,1,dbz
Aegisth,it feels that way because the latest chapters have been surrounding u16 it been months in real life of just them but these chapters focus on only a few hours in universe we have had plenty of great moments for u18 as well ,1,dbz
Aegisth, her two brothers idiots did not seem very family like my god this is why i dislike the bra hate people grasp at straws to hate on bra even though she is written well a bratty arrogant teenage girl who has the power to destroy galaxies and yet people try and say she not a good character and is a mary sue i call my brothers idiots all the time they do the same to me we do it both in jest and in seriousness when they have done something idiotic that not un family like millions of family members do that everyday she not different than vegeta was through most of the series in fact she 10 times better she has the same personality traits vegeta had when introduced arrogant condescending full of themselves and incredibly powerful except at the time vegeta could only destroy planets bra is at least solary system that goes to a young person head ,3,dbz
Aegisth,i do not get this argument how do people expect something to have official canon no other series do i see this argument do you really believe that both super and gt are canon and therefore both actually happened that at some point in the future vegeta chops off the spike of his hair grows a mustache and ends up becoming ssj4 i never understand this argument it makes absolutely zero sense ,0,dbz
Aegisth, 1 yes 2 no 3 seems cool and i think salagir is not finished with ginyu yet 4 overall yes ,3,dbz
Aegisth,it nice to hear that it difficult i try and remind myself of that sometimes that this journey is a difficult one and it okay to admit that i do not know man maybe this is a blessing in disguise as it can kick me into finding a new gig try something else that i like instead this job is secure and safe but also boring and stagnant i find myself caring less and less about it overall and that one of the large reasons why i keep making mistakes i have no stake or care about the company so i do my job well enough for the sake of doing any job well enough but what i do does not matter in the least really i have no real desire or like for the position i am just afraid of going out there and trying new things ,2,stopdrinking
Aegisth,i havent made a big mistake like this where it cost money but i have made mistakes that stem from the same problem that why i think it the last straw ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,did not expect to see this here ,2,dbz
Aegisth,this really helped me thank you ,3,stopdrinking
Aegisth,tien went out and became a farmer he still trains but he told the rest of the group you will probably never see me again basically retirement ,2,dbz
Aegisth,before getting to the actual things you listed out the biggest problem with this comes from how difficult it will be to keep track of it also goes against 5e design philosophy of keeping things simple it a cool idea but as it stands at a table with 4 5 pcs and a handful of npcs it going to be hell to keep track of for everyone on top of all of their spells other effects ,15,dndnext
Aegisth,well yeah cell would still come back and kill trunks causing vegeta to go a bit crazy and being attacked by cell gohan would still save vegeta and be gravely wounded ,6,dbz
Aegisth,oh this is fantastic stealing this one ,1,dndnext
Aegisth,could just get an axe of returning ,2,dndnext
Aegisth,what is this would efending slavery stuff ,7,politics
Aegisth,where did you learn to draw i know you did this everyday but i am wondering what other steps you took ,2,pics
Aegisth,oh good to know that absolutely crazy ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,why does it start half way through the battle and how does rikku have dark matters with no blitzball how does auron have auto med without customization ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,i know that ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,how are the enemies generated the heroes i suppose that come into your dungeon ,1,Games
Aegisth,i have never played this type of game before what is it like ,1,Games
Aegisth,yeah i would rather do it and come up with the challenges on my own it what made osgto not challenging besides it being easy i knew all of the strategies right away as to your other post since we are tlaking on two threads i will probably do nsgro and osgrononi,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth, osgronino this is almost entirely dependent on customization then yeah i will probably try that one out then sounds like fun ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,simply noto would be interesting since so many strategies with overdrives deal with switching weapons over and over to get spiral cut in quickly the nsg rikku only would be interesting i am not familiar with her mix at all i imagine much of the later strategies come from trio quartet of 9999 and those gems that hit multiple times ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,i guess mostly what i am asking is what is the most challenging fun run you know of have done ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,that sounds ridiculously hard since you cannot heal well until you get rikku i have only done tidus only osg i customized for things that could be dropped but did not want to spend time grinding for as well but did not customize anything strong like evade and counter and things of that sort is osg auron only any more entertaining than kimahri kimahri only forces me to play blitzball for several hundred hours it seems ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,uh what ,4,dbz
Aegisth,do you have this image for the standard sphere grid ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,does not esuna cure petrification the challenge just sounds similar to a normal game that most people would go through except the no items and no summons but with yuna able to use esuna whenever that should not be much of a problem additionally auron and tidus do a respectable amount of damage by the end of their sphere grid wakka should as well i just know i have beaten bfa without the use of more advaned techniques while staying within the osg ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,so where would you rank some of the more popular challenge runs in terms of difficulty from least difficult to most ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,for post lategame stuff sure but op specifically said it needed to be done against the final boss that can be either bfa or yu yevon ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,why do you need to use spare change against the final boss are the characters not able to beat bfa yu yevon on their own within their own sphere grid additionally what exactly are purple spheres is that like a strength sphere that you use on an empty node ,3,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,what challenge would you consider would ifficult then and what do you mean by difficult ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,yeah i saw some of his videos it seems as if he never made it past spectral keeper it seems i chose the most difficult osg challenge i could ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,oh interesting is there information on osgko anywhere that i can read up on i do not know any community that talks about this ,2,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,just kimahri section of the sphere grid ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth, yeah the kimahri sphere grid section only is honestly kind of a bad rule just in the fact that kimahri has probably the worst section besides maybe rikku but at least she goes fast i know that hence the challenge in challenge run all other solo run characters are similar in that you cannot leave their sphere grid also during boss battles you need to have allies die because if they just switch weapons defend they are still a valid target so it really not kimahri only i cannot control everything i have them try to kill each other during boss battles but this is a rule in most solo run challenge guides on gamefaqs regardless 1 more tip win the blitzball tournament and dodge 50 lightning bolts to get a collective 4 strength spheres which is huge early game i have been doing that every playthrough since the remaster came out and tidus is able to do roughly 4000 6000 in macalania i did not know you got strength sphere with the lightning bolts i will have to do that i always win the blitzball tournament though yeah ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,use kimarhi sphere grid ,1,finalfantasyx
Aegisth,what because it in his perspective ,1,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,the defensive stems from guilt and shame coming from an alcoholic she needs to know you will be there to help her quit drinking if she decides to that you are worried and you love her and leaving it in her hands to decide alcoholism is an inch disease it kills you by inches and it takes a moment of desperate clarity to walk away from it and ask for help and that clarity moment will only come if she knows you will be there nor judging just helping you cannot force this you can only smooth the path to recovery for her once she decides to follow it make the path look like an easy bike ride and she more likely to try it than if it seems like a thorny hellscape good luck i wish you both the best it a journey ,29,AskReddit
Aegisth,frost demons is my head canon ,8,dbz
Aegisth,thanks for taking an actual interest in talking to me about it i know if i keep going i am going to be a broken record,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,i have not consistently exercised in years so i am not sure but when it comes down to it basically it just do it eh ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,not drinking really did just leave it exposed same for me it gotten better the past half a year for sure i can see and feel the difference but still there lurking in the shadows looking for its moment to bite my shin as i walk by thanks for the laugh about the book i do the same thing yes i do want to exercise even though i do not want to i really do not want to exercise though how fucked up is that i know all of the benefits of exercise especially when recovering but i just do not does not make a lick of sense i contacted an aikido place to see their prices the true voice deep down that is my autopilot tells me i am not going to go i have to make a real solid effort to rise past it i should just stop thinking and just do it tomorrow morning call them 11am set up a first class for that night if possible like how i went to aa the day i got out of of detox god i feel like such a fuck up just want to curl up into a ball and squeeze into a pocket dimension where no one can find me ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,i spotted going to aa because of the issue i had with god and my alcoholism i could not reconcile the two i should try therapy i just never actually do it ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,i am proud of you ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,it just feels like it not enough getting rid of the alcohol has not fixed my other bad habits what would i like to change i do not know where to start it one thing at a time i know but eh i am out of shape i am about 20 lbs overweight i am not proud of any of my skills my job is rather boring but secure i do not feel comfortable leaving my job because it has good perks and i have to pay 1200 a month in student loan debt i do not go out and meet new people i feel like i look like a slob often i am stupidly messy i just do not feel proud of myself at all really and i know the steps i can take to fix some of these things go to the gym eat better search for a new job while i have an old one but it so much easier not to so much easier to spend an afternoon after work playing a game and chatting with friends i am just anxious scared and lazy about making any changes and it makes mee feel like a coward because of it these feelings are small at any given day but over weeks they grow and come together and i end up laying awake like tonight on another note it honestly bothers me that no one has asked about my sobriety in my friends and family we talk about it for 5 minutes whenever i bring up that it been another month not going out of their way i suppose i am just hoping for too much there sorry lots on my mind tonight ,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,it gets better,1,stopdrinking
Aegisth,is your first sober day father day ,1,explainlikeimfive
Aegisth,thanks will change it that what i get for only listening to the audio books ,2,Art
Aegisth,holy shit i did not know that there were only 2 dragons left that means michael killed the third last surviving dragon on the planet ,1,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,if dresden himself ever wrote a book series he would write the entire series just so he could have this punchline be the final one ,5,dresdenfiles
Aegisth, fair enough but even then the supposition is that they had any real level of free will in the first place to harken back to acting on the main point was your doubt that maive had any free will in her past to begin with my last post talked about it as a given i am super confused about what the point you are trying to make about op post is now honestly ,1,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,regardless of if it was not a perfect analogy the point still stands free will is the one thing maive the winter lady could not have nemesis gave it to her ,1,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,i do not see any contradiction to op point in your above post maybe we are under different assumptions but if a person is born in bondage and without free will since the beginning of existence free will is not a major temptation for them think of it likes this if i told you you could no longer have rocks from the bottom of the ocean for breakfast every morning would you really care no because you have never had them for breakfast and it does not sound that good and you are pretty fine how you are but take a creatue that has been eating rocks from the bottom of the ocean since birth if you take it away it stings they do hurt from the loss because they understand what they have lost maive would not have desired free will so much if she had never had it in the first place the adversary could have reminded maive what it felt like to have choice and truthfully it the only real thing maive could not have without its help she was one of the most powerful beings in existence she could take and have almost whatever she wanted except for choice except for freedom from the mantle the adversary gave that to her it seems like the most direct route of temptation you could give a queen of fairy choice ,2,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,there a clear difference between literally not being able to lie and having a mother that might kill you for lying additionally we do see it happen with maive maive ranted in cold night about finally being free and she used to be a mortal it pretty clear she remember her ability to act freely i am not sure why you are denying this since it was the main motivation maive had for acting how she did at the end of cold night ,5,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,hence why i said second oldest gurff eldest gruff is only about 5 tall ,30,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,uh op did not imply that the memories were taken he implying that nemesis pushed on their feeling of constraint by the mantle and the inability to act against the court law by stirring their memories and desire for actual free will he was able to control them ,8,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,name have power though and a title is a name ,1,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,no way the second oldest gruff could take down kringle kringle is as powerful as the erlking and mab herself possibly more ,6,Art
Aegisth,the biggest problem would be introducing these concepts without gaining too much negative attention and being executed for one reason or another ,1,Showerthoughts
Aegisth,the entire z cast will probably be able to keep their bodies in the after life which is basically the same thing ,5,dbz
Aegisth, if god said he can beat anyone then yes same in this case the game description literally says it can block all attacks game descriptions are not the end all be all we go by feats first that why officially wog is considered less of a piece of evidence than an actual feat thinking about this reminded me that sora also has second chance that makes him survive lethal damage with 1hp so even a universe buster attack would not kill him but he would die from basically anything after that unless he heals and please do not say he was not shown to survive a universe buster attack with second chance he would be brought back to life by the magic sure and then he would die afterwards because everything in the universe would be destroyed ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth, logic you have no logic on why it can do anything except that a game description says it can block anything look let look at this way i have a character who has beaten up a bully in the third grade he 8 years old he won handily do i make the assumption that he can now take on an 18 year old athlete no because he not shown anything near that in regards to marluxia attack instant death is a pretty general thing what exactly is the attack and in regards to sephiorth meteors is a loaded word sephiorth throws medium sized fiery rocks at sora it not very impressive ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,because it has not been shown to do that i want it to actually block something better than a fire spell there a huge difference in blocking firaga compared to blocking a supernova ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,what is to say it can based on your reasoning if we introduce a spell that can literally destroy universes you would say that it would reflect it based on the fact it a spell it has no anti feats showing that a universe busting attack would not get blocked we can only say it blocks what we see it block otherwise we can assume it can block any magic since it never been shown to be beaten ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,he can recognize saidin being used and react with a weaving of his own in the time it takes for a lightning bolt to hut the ground ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,reflect has not blocked anything as powerful as what ishi can throw around it blocks all of kh magic which is nothing like wot magic ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,how fast is sora in canon ishi is as fast as rand who is able to react to a lightning bolt falling on top of him sora faster than that ,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,i cannot get past that i now hear these voices instead https www youtube com watch v u86eap3tnye,15,dbz
Aegisth,this is fantastic captures the feel of dresden so well no love for winston zeddmore typical this clinched it honestly ,2,WritingPrompts
Aegisth,1 because people discredit cell claim of solar system busting as boasting and did not take it as true 2 superman has a few feats that are stronger than that lifting a book with infinite pages for isntance that makes it seem like he better 3 the community at large was pissed at dbz fans because of some of their claims about the series as a whole broly for instance it still a contested issue and it a pretty complicated fight for multiple reason beyond what i described ,4,whowouldwin
Aegisth,uh ssj2 is significantly more powerful than perfect cell and perfect cell is the one that made that claim this is about 7 8 years before the start of dragonball super the whole cast is much more powerful now than they were back then ,9,whowouldwin
Aegisth,yeah he was said to be about as strong as perfect cell by goku when they first met babidi magic can only work on evil people the mind control enters through the impurities in their heart and controls them through that it why he used it on vegeta it never said to work better the more evil a person contained but it possible ,6,whowouldwin
Aegisth,based on perfect cell claim about having enough energy to destroy the solar system yeah they would have to be you can discredit cell claim as boasting but i believe it ,12,whowouldwin
Aegisth,no but he at ssj2 levels of power and he incredibly prideful and vain while we cannot qualify it it obviously more difficult than incapacitating a 5 year old it a ballpark figure we can say babidi mind control is not little league stuff because it can take over lords powerful enough to bust stars arguably and make that powerful being give up their entire kingdom it an example we can use so we do not throw away the mind control as weak ,10,whowouldwin
Aegisth,what does the el suffix stand for ,3,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,i mean babidi managed to put the lord of hell underneath his control and get him to leave his kingdom entirely behind that should not be a terribly easy thing to accomplish ,20,whowouldwin
Aegisth,small world i was out near chicago the past year and recently came to jersey where were you at i was out in the burbs in naperville,1,r4r
Aegisth,how is that edgy ,2,dbz
Aegisth,you need to study anatomy more as well goku right shoulder is at an unnatural angle and goku hips are turned in such a way i am not sure how his spine is not breaking ,3,dbz
Aegisth,i hate you ,3,dbz
Aegisth,this is easily the scariest part of the series for me ,2,HaloStory
Aegisth,it not about the approximate intake per day necessarily but on how physically dependent the individual body is on alcohol at the time of quitting ,2,Documentaries

Aegisth,yeah you should really see a medical professional alcohol withdrawal is no joke ,3,Documentaries

Aegisth,please for those who are looking to stop drinking the withdrawal from alcohol can kill you please speak with a medical professional before quitting cold turkey it not worth the seizure ,2,Documentaries

Aegisth,how did i never know this i have been on reddit for years,6,PokemonReborn
Aegisth,are there any theories on what choice difference that was ,2,dresdenfiles
Aegisth,hell imagine super mac platforms with energy shields,1,whowouldwin
Aegisth,hell yes with halo 5 level technology humanity would outpace the covenant technologically within a few decades the cole protocol would still go into effect and oni secrecy priority would still exist we would have pin point slipspace jumps and ships that can literally plow through covenant ships and take no damage energy shields hell with the technology of post war and production of pre war nova bombs would be more widespread imagine a pin point slipspace drop of a nova bomb into an enemy atmosphere they would literally be able to crack high charity in half using a slipspace jump into its center with a nova bomb the covenant have zero counter to that at all humanity would become evil if they had post war technology before the war ,2,whowouldwin
Aegisth,yeah that what i am hoping i am just worried they will forget ,1,criticalrole
Aegisth,oh i am so worried they are going to forget the ancient bronze dragon they have ,5,criticalrole

Aegisth,it is a lot better i remember my shits were terrible when i was drinking not solid at all and felt like i was shitting fire i would forgotten about that it crazy how easy my brain forgets the bad parts of the drunk ,1,stopdrinking
