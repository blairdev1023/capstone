Trauermarsch,unfortunately the nature of the users mods dynamic is that each users voice gets diluted into a drop in the bucket composed of a thousand incoherent babble mods of fair sized subs do not go around getting input from each user that comes by deep into their heart because that would be incredibly inefficient have you considered that perhaps you may have come across to the mods as rather rude after all being banned for you seems to be a pretty big deal but for the mods it was tuesday there is a difference between how users and mods see bans a mod uses the ban to remove the user from the premises a red flag of sorts because he or she is causing trouble the easiest and the most permanent way to solve this is to remove the trouble users and life goes on users however may see the ban as unjust which of course it can be but i question the injustice in your bans how derailing your slapfight with another user got could certainly be a factor to your r shitpost ban i am completely unfamiliar with how the r pic modteam operates and it is indeed a glaring flaw in their sidebar that they have not included the repost rule ,6,TheoryOfReddit
Trauermarsch,you do sound like the typical problematic users not properly reading the rules and then going around getting banned let consider each ban r shitpost no context of your fight or the severity of it are given ambiguous r pics i assume r pic is tiny so you did repost your picture a million types hyperbole as per i have had several posts removed because it does not follow their title guideline rules i am like ok but you keep removing them because your fucking title rules are vague where you implicitly concede the multiple reposting of a pic again no link to the threads in question but you have broken the rules the title discussion is kind of up in the air as you did not provide examples of your titles r wtf so you posted what you admit is gore in a subreddit that no longer allows gore except you do not think it gore and then they let some other gorey pic through the subreddit seeing as there little reason to think that the mods there have a reason to target you specifically perhaps it more reasonable to determine here that the modteam and you have a very different definition of the word it happens ,10,TheoryOfReddit

Trauermarsch, no that came from repeating the abuse from your mommy and molesting your own daughter i am afraid you really are boring me though at this point you have already been outed as a 4chan level dipshit but now you are keeping the same boring drum beating i was at least creative enough to move from mocking you as a pseudointellectual troll to mocking you as a pillhead to concluding with you as a repeat abuser who hopefully did not figure out how to reproduce no seriously on that one i hope you and your cousin at least wore condoms have fun pretending to be edgy and intelligent though i am sure it will do you so much good when hillary goes go jail and there is not any more money to spend on ctr shills this was the comment that got you the ban the you have been temporarily blah blah is a generated comment on any ban your lie i was banned for stating ctr shills were in this subreddit as you can see in the comment it was not because of that but a gross violation of the civility guideline as for context of the conversation if you see a comment that breaks the rules report it instead of doing something stupid and getting banned yourself ,5,politics

Trauermarsch,the comments section in this subreddit is for polite inter party discussion the reason we do not allow calling someone out for whatever is that the other side will use that as an excuse to torch the other let me give you an example ron i hate gay people leonard fuck you ron i am being persecuted this then incentivises the pseudo victim to call upon his mates and then start a battlefield in the comments section the outcome of which we have to clean up another side effect of allowing users to insult each other is that they will use the excuse to say but he said this so why cannot i call him that ron mods i was called a thing and the guy who called me that did not get banned it means i can call him thang back right mods no ron fuck this biased sub reminder this is a politically neutral subreddit which aims to facilitate political discourse regardless of which party they stand for as long as they abide by the rules hatespeech racism calls for doxx violence suicide threats etc and more are covered in our rules and should be reported not responded to ,1,politics

Trauermarsch,oh yes the actual scale of the biological warfare and its duration is still being discussed in academia i merely came to dispute the op insinuations which were a european colonists were unaware of how disease could spread before germ theory really b natives were not intentionally given diseased blankets when we do have documentation of such cases unfortunately due to the general lack of documentation among the academics of that time since most of them would be in europe not traipsing around a new continent and listing incidents of genocide the question of the exact magnitude of the intentional destruction of the indigenous people is still being talked about ,1,The_Donald
Trauermarsch,for some rough research r askhistorians is always a great place since they are required to cite their sources when prompted of course primary sources are the best but those are expensive af and often not available in online format so not useful in online discussions something i wish would be remedied soon ,6,The_Donald

Trauermarsch,since you have brought up that you were banned for supporting trump false of course we would have to ban a couple of our mods if it were so i assume i am free from the we value the privacy of the user and do not reveal the reason for their ban clause ,0,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,the slack channel is essentially shitpost central there have been no ctr meddlings within the modteam there was however a breitbart affiliate in the modteam for quite a while until he stopped meeting the modqueue work requirements ,1,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,what would you have me do no really what would you do if you were the mod of r politics which from what i can see 90 reddit liberal should i manipulate the votes do i ruthlessly ban people curb discussion to approved topics r politics is not just a subreddit on politics it is the combination of reddit politically inclined users that means it heavily leans left tends to dislike donald trump and all that ,1,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,ouch yeah that shotgun comment was out of line he is not part of my modteam though and different modteams as i mentioned elsewhere have different moderating philosophies if you would like an example of a medium sized subreddit that runs a tight ship i would say check out r askhistorians ,2,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,i will keep the link saved although today will be rather busy dealing with all the modmails we will be receiving p,1,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,some notes 1 we did not ban breitbart if a breitbart post gets removed it because it violated our rehosted content rule 2 personally agree with many of your points although i wo not specify which since it will probably come to bite me back when it gets linked to i dunno srs but the modteam operates with consensus of everyone and that means i cannot act singlehandedly on things i see as issues 3 i have already mentioned somewhere in here that i see this as a class wealth issue hope that allays some of your contempt having somewhere to complain and digest your situation is a damned good thing in fact that was one of the main reasons for the slack group i would also like to note that i am not one of those people that spent the last 10 years without an ounce of empathy for us the revitalisation of the mid west is an assignment america has to solve and fast ,1,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,completely understandable i kind of share the frustration as well of not being able to just blast the endless tirades we find in the modmail as well sometimes but it the price we pay for being more professional of a subreddit since we would get criticised for being unprofessional if we revealed some i would not want you to just blindly follow a statement without proof of course the name is actually a reference to mendelssohn trauermarsch funeral march ,2,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,i understand that u qaq3 was asking what i thought on how the dems lost not the issues within the party that might have helped win votes ,1,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,i would say i am more familiar with the donald more than the many users in it who seem to think that reddit moderators are equivalent to reddit admins p jokes aside proof of such would mean the documentation of the modmail which is a strict no no in our policy some of you reading this comment however should be self aware enough to know that you were one of those people sending those disgusting shit ,1,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,i really cannot comment more on that since it bordering on doxxing sorry hope you have a happy thanksgiving unsullied by all this ugliness on reddit ,1,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,i really miss the times when the donald was more humorous and joking around instead of the hatred directing machine that it had become under cwm and the banner of which viking followed the current modteam seems to be more mellow but due to their history it somewhat difficult to work together with them here to hoping that the donald no longer becomes the bastion of hatred and insulting pms and instead refocuses on the president ,2,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,i do not think you really understood the bit about me not being an american left but i can see that you are not exactly interested in a discussion just something to rail against i hope you have a nice thanksgiving ,1,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,self awareness is not something i need to understand that since i am not an american left the dying way of life in the mid west understandably contributes to the lashing out of the people there as well as the archaic election system it is the failings of the democrats in taking care of the worries of the working class whites that contributed to their loss as well as trump charisma and fuck this shit attitude one which is very attractive to a voter who feels his voice has been ignored and his social circles maligned by the sneering city folks i do not think it a left vs right issue or even a race issue i think it a class issue ,2,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,we do not ban conservative leaning opinions we ban comments that are rude namecalling and overall not conducive to civil discourse note for example how we refrained from banning breitbart despite it being complicit in the doxxing or how we do not automatically ban the donald users unlike some subreddits your comment is a prime example of what is removed actually be it left wing or right wing we deal with those the problem becomes then that there is an overwhelming number of comments like yours in the modqueue resulting in a very slow pace of processing the reports sometimes it can seem like we have intentionally left a comment up despite it being rude calling republicans reptards etc but it more likely that it been left in the modqueue ,2,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,it not surprising that a subreddit that sends its members to routinely harass other subreddit mods would earn their ire really if anything they have themselves to blame i am sure that if you were receiving rape death random insult all of the above you would start to slowly but surely dislike the source subreddit ,3,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,eh victim blaming is a pretty shitty thing to do especially when i do not do any of those stuff you accuse me to i just wish people would be civil in political discourse within the sub ,0,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,i am not sure if you have kept track of reddit events lately from back in 2015 the td mods have engaged in massive harassment of r politics modteam with cwm and viking successively being in charge it only lately with the banishment of viking from their ranks that they have somewhat lessened their attacks on us if there are any talks of td needing to be dealt with it entirely due to their actions i would also suggest trying to mod a community that is being disrupted by external forces before talking about something you have very little idea about they have doxxed three of my co mods stickied said articles to the top and they have received no punishments the admins are being very lenient with td ,2,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch, talk shit get hit dude lol if that kind of attitude prevailed among subreddit mods then you are bound to see a lot more mod abuse while each modteam is different the mods are largely janitors who remove content irrelevant harmful to their subreddit and get called cucks and faggots and unpatriotic unpatriotic to what lol in modmails and pms sometimes leading to irl repurcussions as you saw mentioned in the archive i do not think you quite realise how many assholes there are among users and how the users outnumber mods there bound to be mods burned out by the parade of idiocy that marches in front of their modmails pms every day hence the shitposting to relieve that stress it cathartic ,4,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,why would not they shit talking is one of the ways of venting frustrations about certain users without making it affect their judgement ,2,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,the aforementioned doxx is gonna cause one of my co mods a lot of hardship as if that mod did not get harassed enough irl already thanks to td ,8,SubredditDrama
Trauermarsch,one of my modteams was harassed by td for more than a year and even then we did not pull the shit he has the admins made the cake that we are forced to eat and now they have put on a fucking fireworks display that the mods have to clean up in their respective subreddit ,29,self

Trauermarsch,mod of large sub here we have to deal with so many people demanding why they were banned while in their comment history they have a spew of racist otherwise rulebreaking comments that is pretty obviously against the rules in the sidebar tell them that and they go free speech and you are cucked so i would say there would be zero interest from default modteams to do anything so time consuming as a mock trial for redditors when more than half the ones being banned are those types who would never admit to breaking the rules ,9,TheoryOfReddit

Trauermarsch,i initially joined because i was interested in us politics one which has huge effect on my own country politics i kind of grew to like the other mods and how tight the mod procedures were out of necessity i presume because a loose and lawless modteam would not survive long in r politics it being the battleground of other political subs we have a pretty close modteam too we decide policies by votes after a long period of discussion because each policy decision we make for the subreddit will cause someone to hate us more the question is how can we maximise the positive impact for the sub while having the least amount of people shit on us p it truly unfortunate that we have lost so many mods due to sheer burnout in this election i hope that after the election people will be less inclined to mass pm death threats listen to demagogues on reddit that attempt to direct the flow of votes and generally try to think for themselves for once ,97,SubredditDrama
