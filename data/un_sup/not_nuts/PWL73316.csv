PWL73316,post wwii there was an agreement called bretton woods where everybody else gave up gold backed currency and instead backed their currency with fixed quantities of usd in part because most countries had exhausted gold reserves fighting wwii the usd was still convertible into gold this is the origin of the usd being the established currency used in almost all international transactions even transactions not involving american parties it also the reason people began to hold dollars preferentially because they could be converted into gold in the 1960s this system began to unravel as the america was running a permanent negative balance of payments meaning more usd left the country than came in this meant that the america was taking on more and more liability for gold conversions while the total gold supply remained basically fixed the system was also fundamentally unfair in that the america could print dollars while everyone else had to trade equivalent value for them france and west germany never liked the system and began continually making noise about converting all their usd into gold and leaving west germany left the currency peg and began converting their dollar reserves into gold france then followed suit president nixon quit the system in 1971 in what is called the nixon shock he ended the convertibility of dollars into gold overnight as part of many broad efforts to offset the subsequent loss in the value of the dollar he signed an agreement with saudi arabia to price all oil in dollars this was supposed to partially offset the loss of gold convertibility and keep the usd strong but here is the important part it did not work the dollar lost tremendous value throughout the 70s and inflation reached double digits under president carter it was not until paul volcker was willing to bite the bullet of instigating a big time recession by raising interest rates very high that the value of the dollar stabilized so yes the fact that oil is priced in dollars has some impact on the value of the dollar but that impact is very small usd was already the world accounting and reserve currency before the oil agreement in 1971 and remains so today the very strong and stable positon of the america economy and subsequent desirability of the dollar is why the america was able to set up things like bretton woods or the agreement with saudi arabia in the first place ,7,politics

PWL73316,they do now because the government takes 15 of their wages their entire life to pay for social security and medicare people would have massive retirement savings if they took that 15 and invested it over 50 years a 100 investment in the s p 500 in 1967 would be worth about 1480 today even after adjusting for inflation obviously though we could not make a complete change one day it would have to be a long transition period bush plan was a step in the right direction because it still forced you to invest the money instead of cutting taxes this addresses the concern that people simply wo not save if they do not have social security to force them to not that social security is really an investment program but that how it explained to people ,0,politics
PWL73316,removing the cap would only fund it to 2055 just kicking the can down the road we have not had any kind of real fix in 40 years and we wo not be broke for 20 more that is the kind of approach we need not just raising taxes more and more and more every time the money is going to run out it a broken model that assumed exponential population growth that is never going to happen again we need to acknowledge that and fix the model furthermore removing the cap just makes it into even more of an old people welfare program than it already is the reason contributions are capped is because benefits are capped if you are not going to cap contributions the whole program should be redone into a real means tested welfare program where everybody pays into it through taxes but most people never see any benefits cut the rates and use it to help truly destitute seniors and the disabled most people could use 10 of their wages back ,0,politics
PWL73316,the weeping policy change in 2005 really was not what it would have allowed is for younger workers to direct some of their fica taxes away from social security and into quasi private individual accounts instead so for example if you were a 25 year old worker under bush plan you could voluntarily redirect some of your fica tax up to 4 of your total wage currently 15 3 of wages are taken as fica to be invested in a number of investment plans featuring all kinds of stocks and bonds these plans would be similar to an ira their value could go up or down and gains in the plan were untaxed until realized at withdrawal the whole intention of the bill was basically to help younger workers prepare for the social security shortfall while still forcing them to save for retirement it would lower payments into the system resulting in the shortfalls happening at a quicker pace but it would allow younger people to save for retirement in a vehicle that would bring much greater returns than from the faux savings of social security and insulate them from the massive shortfalls of the future under current law and fiscal projections social security benefits will be cut to 75 of the current level beginning in 2034 and continue paying roughly 75 of what was promised for the foreseeable future if you did not opt in to the retirement accounts your social security would be unaffected and you would have gotten that 75 but if you did opt in to retirement accounts you would have a potentially much larger nest egg at retirement age plus the payments you still made into social security ,1,politics

PWL73316,i say this as a fairly libertarian person austrian economics is dead it well less popular within economics than climate change denial is in climate science and maybe given slightly more credence than flat earth theories in whatever discipline covers round earth territory but i agree with you which is even more concerning it like alchemy suddenly gaining a huge following there not even such a thing as an alchemist to try to lead these weirdos ,2,Economics
PWL73316, and what about the job creators represented by such grassroots organizations as alec americans for prosperity and the cato institute they hate obamacare too to be fair basically all of these people hate trumpcare even more than obamacare the club for growth has literally been sending twitter ads to my phone for the past two weeks telling me to call my local gop house rep and urge him to vote against the ahca people who work in conservative think tanks are generally very principled just like people who work in liberal think tanks they want a freer healthcare market on principle your principles might be different and that okay but when ryancare originally included provisions to end the tax subsidy for employer purchased insurance that was those think tanks at work they want a free market that gives more opportunities to more people not the crony corporatism we have right now obamacare and trumpcare are both close to the worst of all worlds they are tremendously expensive the government spends far more than it would on universal healthcare but at the same time people cannot afford their premiums or their deductibles people do not get the care they need and the government is trying to coerce people into buying private insurance whether they want it or not we would probably be better off under both a single payer scheme or a less regulated to death healthcare market that allowed for more innovation and freer choice ,3,politics

PWL73316, you are against changing tradition on a whim yet you do not really have any tradition left to save so of course faithful catholics which honestly we are among friends here we can admit are a very very small minority want to save those vestiges that are left if i were a roman catholic i would be more concerned with reestablishing tradition in liturgy than by holding on to mere discipline por que no los dos the most important thing is to stop the bleeding and stem the advance of modernism within the church we cannot restore the liturgy until we stop the various efforts to finish the already wounded liturgy off ,2,Catholicism
PWL73316,that a different question the same issue would be if the government obligated employers to give out food vouchers could a jewish employer refuse to give out the pork ones under hobby lobby the answer is yes because the government could just give out the pork vouchers itself instead of forcing an employer to do it on their behalf ,1,politics

PWL73316,i think they confused outlandish for impossible the america has never done any significant research on using insects as weapons in general and what little we have done was focused on insects directly spreading disease not destroying crops this was the era of ddt when yellow fever and malaria had been eradicated in the states and lyme disease and zika hadn t yet become an issue comparing lyme disease and zika to yellow fever or malaria is ridiculous ,3,TheAmericans

PWL73316,the court has a standard for first amendment religious practice review rational basis that has nothing to do with the rfra or its applicability to the aca this is not hard to understand congress itself limiting the impact of the laws that congress passes has nothing to do with the first amendment congress went to the court and they said here are two laws one of them has thousands of pages of rules one is very short and it says that if any of these thousands of pages impose a restriction on the free practice of religion that would not withstand strict scrutiny ignore that part of those thousands of pages the first amendment has nothing to do with it congress passed two laws and explicitly told the court that if the court finds a conflict this law is the predetermined winner ,1,politics

PWL73316,senator cornyn was correct in his statements though the supreme court ruled that because the list of states requiring preclearance had not been updated since 1964 and 1972 and if the formula used then to determine who needed preclearance was used again today the list of states would be completely different the voting rights act was acting not to secure voting rights for citizens but to single out and punish a few states for injustices committed decades ago but that had now been remedied in many cases worse congress did nothing to put newly offending states on the list so the citizens there were not getting any pre clearance protection either the court specifically said that if congress passed a new law with a new list of states determined by some fair process to need pre clearance that would be constitutional congress has not done that and the democrats specifically have not made any serious effort to do that this is section 4 b that was struck down by the court remember this was current law in 2013 b the provisions of subsection a shall apply in any state or in any political subdivision of a state which 1 the attorney general determines maintained on november 1 1964 any test or device and with respect to which 2 the director of the census determines that less than 50 percentum of the persons of voting age residing therein were registered on november 1 1964 or that less than 50 percentum of such persons voted in the presidential election of november 1964 a determination or certification of the attorney general or of the director of the census under this section or under section 6 or section 13 shall not be reviewable in any court and shall be effective upon publication in the federal register the congress was using 50 year old facts and statistics and that is no exaggeration whatsoever to determine where preclearance applied the court begged congress to update the vra for a decade and the congress chose not to do so leaving the court little choice but to strike down the formula as completely arbitrary and an imposition on state sovereignty without any basis ,3,politics
