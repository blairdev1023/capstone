livinbythebay,listen this time i am going to help you out but please understand much of this hobby is learning to do stuff for yourself there is a ton of problem solving based on intuition ability to search for others solutions and taking shit apart you will not have very much fun if you are not willing to put in the work for the time being just fold up pieces of paper to shim the feet you really need a carpenters square and a line level to make sure everything is square start with the table if the surface you are trying to level your system on is not level then leveling the system is going to be impossible you want gravity to help you not hurt you here https www thingiverse com thing 1653631 is the link for z braces i also highly recommend this mod https www thingiverse com thing 1454073 once those are installed and properly calibrated then everything on the frame should be square next step is to get have you system properly trammed that is essentially leveling the build plate to the extruder with the pressed sheet metal plate on there it cannot be done properly you need to get a much thicker aluminum carriage somebody else in this thread already offered to sell you one i for one am a big fan of supporting the maker community and think you should take him up on that offer as the same thing online costs about the same amount here are the tools you need to be successful in this endeavor a proper magnetic line level i got mine at harbor freight for a few dollars a carpenter square the bigger the better imo about 1 foot on each side and a good pair of calipers the calipers are the most expensive tool on this list but you do not need top of the line mitotuyos at work we have the mits but at home i use these https www amazon com gp product b001aqez2w ref oh aui detailpage o05 s00 ie utf8 psc 1 if you are willing to put the time in this hobby is great very informative and useful for all times of machining in the future good luck i wish you well ,1,3Dprinting

livinbythebay,consuming large amounts of the stuff for long periods of time is bad for you i have zero evidence to back this up but i do not think there would be enough buildup to even measure permethrin up the food chain i cannot name a single animal that scavenges dead mosquitoe s maybe ants but i think most are broken down by bacteria and then it would have to be the only thing ants consume is mosquitoes that only died of permethrin poisoning ,1,funny

livinbythebay,we do not have venomous coral snakes here ,3,SanJose
livinbythebay,and i do get that but realistically permethrin has been studied far more than rose geranium essential oils and its still very possible to get ticks with long clothing on at this point i am not trying to convince you anymore but i think people reading this need to realize that pants and high socks are not an effective deterrent unless you are shingling with tape and maybe tape your collar ,2,funny
livinbythebay,its perfectly safe for humans not that this says much but the military treats all of their clothes before they issue them the only issue health wise with it that it is very toxic to cats before it dries here http npic orst edu factsheets permgen html study is some more information on the toxicity of it there is one study mentioned using 4 stuff on pregnant women with no ill effects the stuff one treats their clothes with is 5 and not applied to skin do your own thing but i am scared shitless of lyme disease after an acquaintance developed a severe seizure disorder from it also i am outside all the time in an area known for lyme disease ,5,funny
livinbythebay,long clothing is the second best defense maybe this is not just like bug spray permethrin is a pesticide if a tick even walks on clothing treated properly they will die i agree long fabrics but the fabric really should be treated too ,4,funny

livinbythebay,you need to use a crimping tool on the mosfet upgrade if you are afraid of fires i would say not using a crimping tool to put spade connectors on would actually increase your fire risk over just leaving it alone bare wires can pop out of screw terminals very easily crimp tools are really cheap and you can even use needle nose pliers instead but the wires absolutely need to be crimped into spade connectors ,1,3Dprinting

livinbythebay,any reply that says fuck the kings i will at least look at twice there are only two king players i actually like and respect kopitar and carter and i very much dislike duncan keith because i do not think he gets enough credit as a dirty player but really go back and watch all of those replays for each play you mentioned one more time i just did right now and let me tell you not a single slash or spear that we are discussing is even on the same level as the mcsorely swing mcsorely almost killed brashear mcsorely intent was to hit brashear in the head as hard as he could and who are you to say if mcsorely stick or the ice did more damage i cannot imagine that it would be easy to figure out for even the doctor that examined brashear there is a reason why we talk about the mcsorely swing 20 years later it was one of if not the most dangerous hits in nhl history all these other recent hits we are talking about are not even in the same ballpark these are the kind of dirty hits that happen once a month in the nhl but i want to make it clear that i think this spear nyquist laid is horrible i do not believe his intent was to catch spurgeon in the face but he did and he really easily could have taken out spurgeon eye thankfully spurgeon is alright i think he deserves somewhere in the range of 6 10 games but given his lack of even a fine in his 317 games in the nhl l think its safe to say he wo not be making a habit out of hits like that ,2,hockey
livinbythebay,holy shit are you really comparing this to the mcsorely hit not even close mcsorely stepped up to the plate and swung for the bleachers i think nyquist at first went for a spear to the gut and then decided to lift his stick over spurgeons head and cross check him and just got caught in between mcsorely was doing his best guillotine impression ,20,hockey

livinbythebay,i have this envelope bag it works gets the job done it has sewn through baffles which make some cold spots and lower the temp rating the material is not very breathable and gets a little clammy with all that said i actually really like mine and if i had a down jacket wool long johns and wool socks on i would be comfortable in the high 30 my so would only be comfortable to the high 40 without such insulating base layers i would not bring it lower than 50 it packs down small and weighs not much at all it has a weird smell and i guess washing it fixes said smell and apparently the down performs better after being washed as well too much oil or dirt from the factory i have not washed mine yet though its a good deal if you are on a budget but i am saving for a higher quality quilt ,2,Ultralight

livinbythebay,nobody ideals line up directly with their party that is my point there are only two real parties in the us you said that some of my leanings do not agree with the republican party so i am not s republican i am saying that false if it were true there would be only two ideologies in the us because there are only two parties on an unrelated note when did i call anybody not a true republican and how did i staunchly assert that my whole point is that democrats and republicans alike come in many shapes and sizes and that whoever is currently in charge of said party does not speak for everyone in that party on every issue when someone asks my political beliefs i do not say i am a democrat or republican i say i am fiscally conservative and socially liberal and i believe in the socialization of certain services such as healthcare and higher education but it does not change the fact that i am a registered republican ,1,atheism

livinbythebay,the dangerous act i was implying was fighting ignorance with ignorance its absolutely not a no true scotsmen fallacy my point was that you cannot say the words all republicans think this way because they come in many shapes and forms thats why i explained that i was technically a republican but deviated from the stereotypes he was inferring all republicans are guilty of ,1,atheism
livinbythebay,which fallacy did i claim it was ,-1,atheism
livinbythebay,so the republican party speaks for every single self described republican most republicans i know think this entire platform is a joke right now many i know are voting for hillary because of it i am a self described anti thiest i also believe in fiscal discipline and social liberalism i am a registered republican i do not want bibles in schools saying every republican is demonstrably close minded is literally demonstrably close minded ,-11,atheism

livinbythebay,as an american i believe eminent domain is in theory a good concept one that is necessary for the advancement of society however i do have issues with how the process is controlled and how property is priced and btw eminent domain was made legal by the fifth amendment in 1791 so by your reasoning the us was only the land of the free for 15 years more than 200 years ago ,1,trees

livinbythebay,the article literally eliminated the idea of fat people by picking all candidates with only the same body fat percentage this article is more closely about how more muscular people have trouble carrying heavier loads like i said in the last comment you did not read the article and for some reason decided it about fat people and now are using this thread as an excuse to shame fat people not to mention with this being an outdoor sub the kind of fat people who would be reading this are probably looking to make a change in their life do you think making fun of them will make them get skinnier or do you think it will add to the cycle of eating and self loathing you are making the problem worse not better with your comments you know what it really comes down to do not be an asshole to people ,8,Ultralight

livinbythebay,i do not know a single fan that was happy about drew departure so i believe you are wrong about that also never said you know nothing about hockey just that you think you know more than you do about moving braun to offense you said move him to the third or fourth line and my point was there is no fourth line on defense marleau i can get on board with but thornton still has years left go look up the chart of his corsi over his career he is only getting better right now obviously at his age his body is degrading but his hockey sense and mentality is getting better and the numbers prove it ,1,hockey
livinbythebay,it was not the fans that ousted drew it was management he apparently was far too critical of management on that reverse sweep against the kings i miss him too you say you are being realistic but its just like your opinion man joe thornton is still a great hockey player who can contribute a lot to our team marleau well his prime is past him you are seriously delusional if you think our defense is terrible though our first two lines are above average third line probably below average nobody makes it to the stanley cup with a terrible defense where we are proves my point demelo and mueller are still young but you are so quick to count them out to have a team that can win the cup you have to have young guys to stay below the cap and do you really want to move braun to offense last i checked there was no 4th defensive pairing i think you just think you know more than you really do while trying to present it as you being a realist and everyone else an idealist ,1,hockey

livinbythebay,lots of chicken nuggets or tenders are pre cooked idk if yours are but trust me you have been lucky it is less of something to worry about in frozen poultry but e coli is a serious worry in uncooked chicken just because you have not gotten it yet does not mean you wo not i believe you should spend a few minutes reading about people who consume only raw meat for their diet they get e coli poisoning all the time ,1,keto
livinbythebay,yeah in my experience the frozen veggies are great every once in awhile for their ease and time saving ability but i end up just not eating my prepped meals after a few days cannot stomach it ,1,MealPrepSunday
livinbythebay,chicken tenders are not raw chicken i think there might be a bit of a language barrier here is english your first language raw means uncooked and i promise if you eat raw chicken for 6 years you will get e coli poisoning raw fish does not carry nearly the same risk but raw ground beef is probably the most dangerous next to chicken ,2,keto
livinbythebay,you are going to get sick of frozen veggies really quickly try your hand at starting with raw veggies it will be more rewarding taste better and be healthier ,1,MealPrepSunday

livinbythebay,wow 0 60 real quick there so by your reasoning no girl who respects herself would be okay with this and i am a condescending asshole for saying there are a few situations where this is not a good idea you may not be able to tell if everyone is comfortable and happy without verbal communication but with my long term so i can it would take me all of 1 second of watching my so body language to know if she was okay or not with it and you know what i have encouraged the lovely lady that spends most of her time with me to do this very thing to me you are sitting there acting like you know how ever woman in the world feels i promise i know my so better than you do and what she is okay and not okay with and calling me a condescending asshole because of it is not very helpful to the discussion ,2,sex

livinbythebay,are you fucking kidding me i have asked you now like 4 times for reasons against having prolific cannabis dispensaries and you have not given me a single damn reason we are plenty willing to listen you just have nothing to say ,1,SanJose
livinbythebay,it hurt liquor stores by offering competition i have asked several times for examples of businesses and people being hurt by cannabis dispensaries and you have offered none i would like to understand why the council felt the need to come up with such harsh anti competetive laws but i have no reasons presented in front of me ,2,SanJose
livinbythebay,but you did not even make it to the only series that matters assuming you are a ducks fan cause that flair looks awfully similar to mine ,1,hockey

livinbythebay,please share some on here i am not masochistic enough to spend my time in city meetings ,2,SanJose
livinbythebay,i did not hurt the local businesses the city council did by making ridiculous laws in the first place ,2,SanJose
livinbythebay,okay the regulations are in place to make it nearly impossible to open and run a dispensary i understand that and arbitrary may have been the wrong word to use the regulations are very far away from keeping san jose residents safe happy and successful and to me those are the only laws that should exist the current regulations are overreaching and obstructive to safe patient access to cannabis and measure c in my opinion will put the regulations closer to where they should be ,3,SanJose
livinbythebay,okay so you personally have no argument for the current over zealous regulation ,2,SanJose
livinbythebay,i asked pretty nicely and the point i was trying to make was there is somebody in this thread committing the most logical fallacies he also happens to be on the same side of the argument as you and you had not said anything to him this has quickly devolved from the original topic ,3,SanJose

livinbythebay,san jose used to be the wild west with cannabis but what issue arose from that people were not getting murdered over drug deals gone bad some residents did not like how close the dispensaries were to their homes but no complaints about liquor stores i would genuinely like to hear the arguments against having fast and loose regulations i think that dispensaries have no place near schools and playgrounds but residential and commercial i am okay with ,2,SanJose

livinbythebay,listen the drive cycle is not a perfect science just drive your car around a bit in the freeway then do exactly what these guys says and take your foot off the gas as early as you feel comfortable with if you get the car from 60 to 20 without braking that is probably fine ,1,bayarea

livinbythebay,one of the most defining characteristics of a monopoly or oligopoly is that the start up costs are prohibitively expensive u nosedragon i commend you for pointing that out in your last sentence ,5,SanJose
livinbythebay, u patriotforall is making some great points and adding a lot to the discussion a lot of people do not want their main account to be arguing about cannabis related issues ,5,SanJose
livinbythebay,you were the one who just compared the business models not me so its easier to have an oligopoly then to create a fair and open business model is that really your argument who is to say those 130 clubs have no interest in following the rules under the current rules they do not even get the chance to operate ,5,SanJose
livinbythebay,exactly how many liquor licenses are granted in san jose it sure is a lot fucking higher than 16 also if one closes another one is allowed to open unlike the rules that are currently on the books in san jose ,3,SanJose
livinbythebay,how many is that in san jose there is a liquor store or bar on every corner not 16 in a city of 1 mil you are fucking delusional dude looking out for the interest of your buddy at the expense of medical patients ,3,SanJose
livinbythebay,while monopoly may be the wrong word oligopoly is the right one if i want to go out and open a dispensary today i cannot do it even if i follow all of the rules the legal cannabis market in san jose is now dictated by haze and the other 15 dispensaries nobody else can join the market currently because of the rules that is an oligopoly which is bad for consumers ie patients ,8,SanJose
livinbythebay,measure c fixes many of the issues that arose from the last batch of san jose medical cannabis regulations you are looking out for the better of the business than the patients i cannot believe someone who is a medical patient or affiliated with patients would want someone to vote no on this measure i think you should think long and hard about what you posted and why you posted it i agree with patriotforall a vote for no on measure c is a vote for corporate interest a vote for yes is for easy safe access for patients with responsible cannabis rules ,5,SanJose
