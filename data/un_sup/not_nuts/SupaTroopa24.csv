SupaTroopa24,ha i will have a rummage sadly the project was canned half way through but not before we got to talk a few times and see some work really nice dude it was for a chocolate filled with caramel so the poster was going to be a photo of a woman sat on a park bench eating the chocolate bar and just above her was this illustrated psychedelic cloud of about 15 caramel gnomes about to pour a cauldron of caramel over her as she bites in to it would have looked amazing alas ,2,Showerthoughts

SupaTroopa24,did a project with age uk a while ago apparently there are over a million pensioners in the uk who go a month without speaking to anyone every year which is just mind blowing in scale and sadness but on a positive note it not often such a massive problem can be solved so easily set up a direct debit become a phone volunteer help in the shops because if you are lucky one day you will be old enough to maybe know what this feels like ,2,videos
SupaTroopa24,really amazing bbc documentary on this last month about the sas and how it was formed in ww2 written and hosted by a times journalist called ben macintyre one of the ex sas soldiers was talking about a very unpleasant moment he had to experience 40 years later as he talking about it he suddenly bursts in to tears and cannot even look the interviewer in the face for a couple of seconds one of the toughest men from one of the toughest regiments and 40 years later he still has no control of the emotions that memory creates i cannot even imagine the horror ,1,videos

SupaTroopa24,i think ed and adele have become commercial simply through their success but they started from a point of just wanting to express themselves i am talking more about the one directions of the world but yes with you on the 15 min space epic lol ,1,videos

SupaTroopa24,solid auto correct on cannabis corpse my man lol nothing you say is wrong i disagree slightly with some things but that fine and i was not calling commercial pop objectively wrong just explaining why i have more respect for other genres which i might not even like using metal as an example hope the rest of your day is good ,1,videos

SupaTroopa24,you are missing out man sit everyone down turn out the lights sit in complete silence in a circle and work your way through joy division discography banging ,0,videos
SupaTroopa24,lol dragons are cool my point was more i think metal bands feel a bigger urge to express themselves like they have something inside to say or share with the world whatever ridiculous thing that might be whereas with commercial pop music the basis isnt i really just want to sing this song about dragons to express myself it would be let write a song bout dragons because other people like it so they might buy it ,1,videos
SupaTroopa24,i think pop music can talk about emotions more than metal simply because the lyrics are clearer but convey them i am not sure i can listen to a pop song and get whether the artist is saying they are sad or not but with metal i actually feel a bit of the rage too if that makes sense i feel the same emotions as the artist more clearly even if they are not expressed as clearly but again suppose it all comes down to personal preference and how you interpret things ,1,videos
SupaTroopa24,agreed should not have said morons i have never been a if you do not like what i like you are an idiot kind of person just let the rant get the better of me ,2,videos
SupaTroopa24,i dont think it particularly controversial to say commercial pop music is objectively less emotionally insightful than the music not made with a commercial angle i also still think the reason kids like commercial pop is because they do not have developed emotions and so they want or need any emotional angle they just want a tune and as they grow up that when people move into whatever genre it is not always but i think that the general pattern true i let the rant get the better of me and should not have said morons,1,videos
SupaTroopa24,amazing how easy it is to write a song for talented musicians when absolutely no heart or soul is required i am not a huge metal fan but i have to respect most metal bands because i know these people are trying to genuinely express themselves they are trying to convey how their spirit sees the world through music which is fucking tricky and takes some serious balls then you get the emotional wasteland that is commercial pop music sweet baby jesus created solely to make money and listened to exclusively by children who have not developed a proper emotional understanding of the world yet and morons who never will rant over thanks reddit edit should not have said morons i let the rant get the better of me treat this like a throwaway comment someone might make over a drink rather than the gospel of my soul edit 2 ok think i have put out that fire thanks for everyone who did not crucify me or if they did then had a chat about it ,3,videos

SupaTroopa24,right so the job market in london is not great right now so i would not suggest coming over here without anything lined up saying that i do not know about the freelance market or for more marketing pr firms you should get in touch with some headhunters like talent business or lizh they will have a much better idea than me and they will be able to tell you wether you should be aiming for internships placements or junior positions if they cannot help and you need help trying to get a placement somewhere i can try hope this helps ,2,advertising

SupaTroopa24,hey so this was the reply from one of the upcoming stars of the planning department planning interns your main job will be lots of research reporting and analysis to help the planners you re working with get to a strategy creative brief this can involve anything from desk research to getting out and interviewing people on the street in the pub to doing competitive mystery shops hard to put it down in concrete terms regarding how these things are structured it s always whatever gets the key points across as clearly and impactfully as possible so it might be a presentation deck but it could be a film a manifesto a series of images it s kind of up for grabs ,2,advertising

SupaTroopa24,i get that off some people like faith healers or that preacher who said god wanted him to have a private jet and his congregation bought him one but i think this guy genuinely believes it ,3,videos
SupaTroopa24,yes exactly and if you say you read it somewhere or saw it on a bbc documentary oh so you just have faith in what a scientist told you do you science is just another form of belief grrr ,7,videos
SupaTroopa24,so true sadly i think it was at the beginning of a hitchen debate when someone asked what would change your mind i cannot remember what the creationist said think hitchen required a large hand appearing in the sky or something but either way it was never going to happen in a debate there is no combination of words that will change either of their minds just have to hope as the kids in this video grow up they start asking more questions than ken ham ever bloody did and convince themselves through their own discoveries ,2,videos
SupaTroopa24,poor bill love the guy but you cannot expect him to know the intricacies of so many varying sciences to be able to smack ham down and you can see it frustrating him too not having the knowledge he knows exist on hand to refute some of these insane claims ,58,videos

SupaTroopa24,god damn this film is sooo good even wes has said it was far too extravagant and that why i kinda love it it basically what happens when you let an incredible mind roam free with a lot of money beautiful over the top madness with bowie covers ,2,movies
SupaTroopa24,it a fucking lovely film very emotional nicely shot great casting whoever made it has got some serious skills and will definitely get picked up by a production company and good on them making spec work like this is not easy or cheap so massive kudos for getting such a beautifully made film out there on their own back but is it a good ad for adidas not really i am afraid and obviously adidas rejected this there quite a lot of discussion in sport about the damage certain sports do to people long term so showing an athlete that lost his mind is definitely something a sports brand will never want to bring up also why have the mental health angle at all why have the man watering his tele it does not need it to make it an emotional film i do not think if it does need the mental health angel to make it emotional then it probably not a great concept if you are going to use the concept break free there are a million other ways of doing it that would resonate far greater with who adidas want to talk to the drudgery of office life our everyday routine breaking free of that is much more what adidas are about hell even a film about a kid trying to break free from school and go running would match better but then breaking free of office life isnt that original so maybe the concept of break free isnt that original i am not trying to be salty or mean just explaining that something can be both a great film but a bad advert and that what i think this is fuck it just take the logo off and go hard on being a director instead of trying to become an ad creative it much more fun anyway source ad creative here please do not kill me,2,videos
