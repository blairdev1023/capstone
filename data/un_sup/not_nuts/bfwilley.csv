bfwilley,under sharia the testimony of a woman is worth status of women testimony in islam https en wikipedia org wiki status of women testimony in islam the status of women testimony in islam is disputed muzammil h siddiqi a notable scholar from north america has said the quran makes very little reference to genders in terms of testimony 1 in cases of hudud punishments for serious crimes 12th century maliki jurist averroes wrote that jurists disagree about the status of women testimony 2 according to averroes most scholars say that in this case women testimony is unacceptable regardless of whether they testify alongside male witnesses 2 however he writes that the school of thought known as the zahiris believe that if two or more women testify alongside a male witness then as in cases regarding financial transactions discussed below their testimony is acceptable 2 3 4 5 in case of witnesses for financial documents the qur an asks for two men or one man and two women 6 7 it is disputed whether this means that a woman testimony worth half that of a man either in disputes about financial transactions or as a general matter on the other hand javed ahmed ghamidi writes that islam asks for two female witnesses against one male in the case of financial transactions because this responsibility is not very suited to their temperament sphere of interest and usual environment he argues that islam makes no claim that a woman testimony is half in any case 8 he interprets the qur an verse as only a recommendation and argues that it will be for the court judge to decide what kind and whose evidence will be enough to prove a case 9 regarding the prophetic narration that is used to prove half testimony status of women javed ahmed ghamidi and members of his foundation al mawrid argue against its reliability 10 and its translation from arabic 11 ghamdi also contends that the narration cannot be used in all general cases because it is related to the qur an verse whose subject is related only to financial matters citation needed another pakistani religious scholar ishaq argues that acquiring conclusive evidence is important regardless of whether it can be obtained from just one man or just one woman 12 of course that all goes out the window along with a lot of people and things when ma sharia is involved ,1,uncensorednews
