Deuceman927,as previous commenters have mentioned the cars cabin heating system is a part of the engines cooling system there are channels and jackets all around the block of your engine where coolant liquid flows all around while the engine is running there is a thermostat essentially a valve that opens at a predetermined temperature and allows the coolant to flow into the radiator heater core part of the system what you do in the car has no bearing on how fast the heat will be available some people think that revving the engine will make the car heat up faster but i believe that under no load that the difference in time to warm up the engine is negligible and it wastes fuel if you have ever seen cars with an electrical plug sticking out of the front of a car this is typically a block heater which is essentially a small electric blanket that is wrapped around the engine block the use of these ranges from giving instant heat when you start up the car on a cold morning to being essential for the car to even start in very cold climates ,2,explainlikeimfive
