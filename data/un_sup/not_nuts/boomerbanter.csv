boomerbanter,shutting down titanpad hi christian hofst dtler michael prokop and i launched titanpad com more than 6 years ago the idea for the project stemmed from the need to provide users of etherpad com ourselves included a safe haven to move to after the rather abrupt shutdown notice given after appjet acquisition by google we believed in the idea of real time hassle free collaborative text editing and wanted to give access to this new way of working on content collaboratively in the years following the shutdown of the original etherpad com we hoped that a community would form around the etherpad codebase which would allow us to foster grow the service in the coming future however while there was a rewrite of the service in node js it was lacking the maturity and features of the legacy etherpad codebase the availability of etherpad lite also meant that the now dubbed legacy etherpad com codebase was doomed to obscurity six years later the situation from an foss perspective is unchanged etherpad lite still lacks features and etherpad legacy remains unmaintained the risk that an unmaintained application poses is non negligeable and compounded by the success of titanpad com over the years we invested considerable amounts of time and money to keep the site running and support its users although the resources needed to keep the site running could be covered by crowd funding the unmaintained application code is not something that can be easily fixed without steady development improvement the project is unsustainable the underlying technologies of the web are in constant evolution and we cannot keep titanpad up to web standards to prevent getting left out in the rain by an incompatible browser update in the future we therefore decided to do a graceful shutdown of the project and give all of you a chance to migrate your data teams and workflows to other services we cannot give recommendations on which service to move to since the needs of all of you differ hugely for some the data privacy aspect was the most important one for others the ability to create private subdomains here are two sites which have compiled lists of alternatives to titanpad com similarsitesearch com moreofit com our schedule for the shutdown is as follows 1st may 2017 all pads will be made read only no new pads can be created 31st dec 2017 titanpad com will shut down best wishes from all of us and thanks for all the pads ,2,shutdown
