german_meatball,i was stationed in germany when i was not in iraq so i know a little about how europeans view us and i thank you for your compliment on the astronomical size of the balls lol one of the biggest views on the iraqi people i now hold close to me is that they have lived their whole lives mostly in sheer terror and that most of the radicals sects from that part of the world are mostly motivated by bullshit propaganda and lies told to them to get them ready to fight as for going back i dont know if i will ever return voluntarily or as a civilian if i was called up by my army again i would do it without question i truly believe those people need to see life without fear even for just one day ,3,AMA
german_meatball,you are absolutely right the military provides you with the tools to get the job done the discipline and the training very quickly become who you are anymore but in some cases like mine and many others something does happen and this is where the military training stops how your brain processes the event is what puts you in the good to go column or the damaged column i have not tried any holistic remedies yet and i am not opposed to them but i would prefer to wait till the va has exhausted their efforts in my mind then i will start looking to the world of natural medicine i thank you for helping my brothers and sisters we need it ,1,AMA

german_meatball,first please realize that ptsd triggers can be different for anyone my triggers stem from the things that scared me the most when i was there i have severe problems with pot holes in the road or piles of garbage on the side of the road these were very likely to be ied while i was there also anyone driving too close or driving crazy was a threat and was to be shot and killed another trigger is fireworks and loud sudden noises while i was in iraq my base recorded approx 400 indirect attacks mortars and rpg every 7 days so every day was possibly my last so loud noises terrify me to my core i spent time in the general public in iraq and everyone was a target women and children alike so now more than 10 years since ive come home i cannot be in crowded places without being able to constantly check the exits sizing up everyone and planning my way out i cant enjoy things like concerts fairs if i am not already a hermit i will be soon ,6,AMA
german_meatball,i was a desk jockey for most of the deployment i had guard duties perimeter details and convoy runs so i was by no means safe or useless the survivors guilt stems from the fact that no matter how hard i did work and how hard i fought i did not step up to the plate ive been in really shitty situations where people around me got hurt and killed i feel that i could have done more and that because i did not i fell somewhat personally guilty for my brothers and sisters that did not make it home i see the events of these bad days constantly just give me 5 minutes where my brain is not actively engaged and i dive head first into a deep downward spiral i almost despise when someone thanks me for my service cause i feel like i did not give my 100 i hope this answered your question please let me know if you would like more info ,11,AMA
