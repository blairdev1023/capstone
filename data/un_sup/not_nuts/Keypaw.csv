Keypaw,i am holding out hope too it why i made this post ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i gave him every chance i saw a lot of myself in him to be honest ,3,gaming
Keypaw,that would be nice ,-1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i mean where did you come across this post there people on both side of the fence my friend ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,eh some people are just salty leave them to their sad little worlds it does not hurt me none but thank you for standing up for me there though perhaps your tone might be a bit harsh haha,2,OutOfTheLoop
Keypaw,well for the first point in overwatch the event skins cost three times the amount to craft but when you get a duplicate of one you get the normal amount of duplicate shards when i say fair what i mean is the value to value amount we have been taught to expect within their own system fair skin prices as in these skins that are only avaible for a limited amount of time make them fair in that free to play players with limited time can get one or maybe two of the skins kids with no income parents who get to play for maybe an hour every other day casuals who help keep the game populated and afloat because a game might make money off the whales but the free to play players keep the population alive and yes i do mean that part of the fun of the event is getting the event related goodies i do not think free to play players should get them all but i think it not too much to ask that it possible for a casual player to be able to get the one that they really want also i quite like your last point it really would not add up very much not unless you got your hero to level 100 and higher like that one lunara player and by that point you probably do not need any shards for that heroes specific loot you would be liable to have it all already haha,-1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,thanks ,2,OutOfTheLoop
Keypaw,i am also curious about this please comment if you get an answer ,-21,OutOfTheLoop
Keypaw,you did not even read the post,-1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,you did not even read the post at all,-2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,or reading the whole post t t,-1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i am with you on this pro consumer practices are good for the life span of games ,-1,Overwatch
Keypaw,i was not able to pin it to the top but you got enough upvotes that that is where you are d,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yeah like i am with you in that top section of your post i made this post for people who cannot afford it or do not have the time investment i want everyone to be able to enjoy the game and all of it goodies ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,this is a great well thought out comment thank you for contributing rather than spitting vitriol at one side or the other ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,amen ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,you and i both,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,events are fun i love them and want to keep having them like i said in the main post seasonal skins do not bother me i just like you said want to rally people to help keep hots as consumer friendly as it has been ,-2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i am only speaking for the people who upvote me and agree who do not want to take the time to post that why i am asking you those questions that you decided not to answer btw so people can upvote you and their voices can be heard this is a discussion not an emperor speaking down to his people how would i even manage that ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,wrong they were going to introduce a gold sink in the form of those ruins from league way back in alpha so we would have less gold to buy free things but they listened too us and removed it we told them the veteran rewards for 2 0 shift into loot boxes were unfair and they listened too us they listen too us ,-1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,please read the entire post before you comment how else can we have discussions ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,it easier to prevent something from being added to a game than it is to remove it from a game why not raise our voice and let them know we do not want something before the fact what does that hurt ,4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yup that what we are having a discussion about and rallying against here 3,-2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,if the community does not agree with me i get downvoted i am giving voice to people with a similar mindset as myself but you are always welcome to try and dissuade us to raise good points and argue in favour of shard increases which no we do not have the point is to prevent them or anything else you have issue with let have a discussion ,-2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,oh then that sad ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i am more concerned with the fact that a bunch of kids and free to play players will be left out there just not that much time to get things you want out of limited team loot boxes if you have got school or a summer camp or something i pay for things i want this game is where my very little extra income goes because i love this game and want to support it but i want everyone to have a fair shake at getting the goodies we also get ,-5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yes and this is why these kinds of posts are important to help amplify these messages ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,that an awful way to put it i would be thrilled if everyone could have all the billie i have but they were exclusive to certain purchase periods i want everyone to be able to enjoy all this great content i am not saying they should not make money off their game but i do not like the idea that casual players or kids of which i am neither i pay for the content i want cannot also get some of their favourite skins and mounts it does not matter if things lose their meaning if everyone is having fun and happy and if you need to feel better than people and have things they do not to have fun and be happy that kinda sad i am sure you did not mean it like that though like i said the way you phrased it was bad i do not think you actually feel that way but there are people who do ,4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,we are not complaining we are expressing our thoughts on what we want to see in our game because once it already in game it much harder to change the point of this discussion is to encourage the same high quality we have come to expect and appreciate ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,see this is a good comment i would love to pin it too the top because i do not agree with everything you say but it a good discussion comment the whole point of this subreddit so many people are getting aggressive at me for this post without actually contributing ,4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,overwatch from whom we have taken our loot box and crafting system this post is not about saying no to something we have confirmed it about saying no to something we do not want to see happen once it in the game it much harder to make the change ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,you did not even read my post did you i do buy the things i want i am making this post for the free to play players who either cannot afford the skins they want or who just do not want to spend money we need them in our community too to help keep the game healthy and successful ,-1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,just look too overwatch for a guide of what they have been emulating their prices are triple they do have the same bosses after all probably seeing the success of overwatch and trying to push it into heroes ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,it is confirmed there a post with all the seasonal loot box data presented in the rising section of the subreddit ,-5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,exactly blizz has been doing right by us but look at wow overwatch and hearthstone they are not great examples of blizzard kindness ya know i do not want hots to turn into an overwatch or hearthstone situation ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i am not speaking for anymore than i get upvotes from that the point of this post if people do not care like you i get downvoted and that fine but so far i have got 20 upvotes so that at least 21 of us who care and they are the ones i am speaking for this is how reddit works dude ,-6,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,then read the whole post that one of the things i want to rally against increasing gem shards costs ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,it is not confirmed the point of the post is to make sure it does not happen because that what they do in overwatch we need to work together to make sure the heroes team knows we do not want that ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,you want skins that cost triple to make but only give you the same as a normal duplicate ,-3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i like all the skin tints tbh because it helps with mount synergy haha,3,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,tracer skin is awesome it suits her sporty personality perfectly way better than a thong would ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,he my favourite but he does not fit sad to say ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yeah but there are other dragons in final fantasy lore maybe just a dragon in the ff style would work but bahamut is the dragon haha i have always wanted to see a mario luigi wario the lost vikings skin if i could pick a cross over maybe bowser instead of wario but i think wario fits the theme haha my favourite final fantasy maybe nine as for character hmm gilgamesh from final fantasy five he actually in most of the final fantasy games after five as well because he can travel between dimensions ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,no worries null must be from the mmos or maybe 13 i was going to suggest stop for the stasis trap but having blizzards helps thematically what would you make her dragon bahamut ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i love your skins though i would make her slowing sands the slow spell big orange clock greats rotating slowly im not sure what null is,6,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i am a level 56 azmo player zag does not beat me she going to lose the obj and the fort on braxis see we can both use personal experience ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yeah its so dumb at the start huge waste of mana,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,people undersell his summons so much its good to see someone who appreciates them,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yeah and do not dunk the enemy hero unless they are on theurnminions always hit the minions use your q and w on cooldown its amazing pressure few heroes can keep up with azmos mana just try to grab every globe and do not be afraid to tap fountain to touch up your manager even if you do not need health the sooner you use fountain the sooner its avalible again ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,my pleasure you have got a great talent i would love to help support it ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,thats why you do not make it a fight you just need to bully him out of lane do not try to laser just as and back off if he connects drain hope ,4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,just focus rexxar keep yourself at range to avoid alarak silence and rag cannot even keep up ,-1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,never had a problem with zag she rubs out of mana way before you ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,still no azmodan though i really liked this list last time and even this time its good but azmodan is a very strong solo laner sonya and artanis are two of the only ones that can beat him in lane ,8,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,ahaha john bravo quote you are my new favourite person ,7,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,hey dude i loved this you really nailed it did you do a voice over in another language as well where are you from if you would ever like i would be happy to record some lines for you in english for future projects or coach you on voice acting i have taken some classes and i would be happy to help you in some way ,1,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,i tried this too it seems the battery must be bad i cannot afford a new one so i guess i will just be using wall power from now on haha,1,techsupport
Keypaw,i do not have a differe not charger sadly and i have tried many outlets but the thing is it getting power from the wall it just not charging at all ,1,techsupport
Keypaw,i mean is not that more telling of the fact that he knows when to support rather than just forcing himself to support ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i only accept this if the enemy team banned one and picked one i do not hold it against someone if they have got at least two they are good with ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i agree with you so much last pick is the flex pick you use it to counter the enemy draft honestly i would go as far to say as all of my best drafts happen when my first pick is tank and second is support because we can always add another support or tank if we need it at that point but we can build our team with the last three picks in the optimal way no matter what ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,the agony of those words,6,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,no i am not she did not have to die at all that true but she did but by the logic you just gave me why would she have to die in any one particular way why not let the creators try to take that iconic moment and make it their own ,3,movies
Keypaw,yeah it like he was mentally unstable or something haha you can grump all you like though i will just keep enjoying the movie ,5,movies
Keypaw,it totally related to your comment because movie gwen is not comic gwen who is not spider gwen now you might ask why i brought her up i do because it goes to show you gwen stacey does not have one set fate in all realities fun fact about that scene the time the clock stops at is the issue number gwen died in ,2,movies
Keypaw,the music in the second one was so good and electro was honestly really interestingly done spider man biggest fan turned evil i loved the hell out of the second garfield was an amazing spider man mediocre peter but amazing at spider man ,2,movies
Keypaw,because each movie universe is a different universe than the comics but still it a real one like the main marvel universe is 616 you could theatrically have the comic book version of spiderman with all the history you know appear in a movie during a cross dimensional thing but the events play out differently in each universe all of the movies are canonical in the comics in that their realities exist even though they never interact what with their being infinite ,2,movies
Keypaw,max value,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,that was not my advice at all the laser build is for holding objectives because you can 1v1 almost anyone easy with it,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,this is my vacourite subreitdddeit ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yeah that why i want it to be a thing where i click the button and it tells me negative feed back like the negative button so you know it going to tell you in what way you sucked ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,learn the e build and how to play with it the best maps for it are small ones like dragon shire tomb where split pushing is not as important it especially good on dragon shire as it makes you the most powerful 1v1 character in the game as long as you play well there very few who can beat you sonya stands out because of her low cool down stun other than that if you want to get even more like small detail oriented with it before the first wave set yourself up so you are near the enemy gates but not near enough the cannons will hit your summon as the enemy minions pass use your summon to draw the archers and stuff leaving their sword users to fight your wave on their own summon your second minion and your general with your first take out the ranged attackers then help your guys finish off the melee minions that way your wave will be mostly fresh and able to tank a lot of tower shots early usually before your enemies rotate from the middle fight ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,sieging wrath is the 25 stacks one you only grab the e if you are doing laser build and you only do laser build if you are expecting a lot of team fights or perhaps on a very small map like dragon shrine tomb ,5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,sieging wrath most of the time esspecially maps with a channel objective the extra range is worth it weight in gold bolster your w and your d as often as you can especially bound minion and forced recruitment take born in battle i think it is the one that summons a w on q you will be a pushing machine your w will be relevent in team fights and your d will push lanes while you are on obj with your team use d on cooldown put it on a sword minion once you get bound minon and it will turn that sword guy into a super tank to suck up lots of ammo take demonic invasion use it on cool down if you can just drop it in the lane you want to push to use it in fights drop it ontop of their backline ideally their healer if they have someone like kael or jaina wait until they use their aoe skill then drop it so it not cleared right away it will ruin their back line and split them hard then help your team take the front line you are a mid line people like chromie and malf are back line artanis and etc are front line but you you do not have any cc but you do have a big body and a big health pool be behind your tanks but infront of your squishes with your laser if you are not using your laser you are dropping your demon warriors on cool down azmo hits like a truck with his aas if you are in lane always drop your w against their waves in the back of their waves to suck up archer shots is best drop your qs on their waves try to get a hero if you can no big deal if you do not do not use your e waste of mana during the laning phase unless you think you can get an early building out of it and when you are aaing it not enemy minions it the enemy hero you want to bully them out of xp soak range also try not to stand in your minion wave it let people like chromie zagara kael etc hit you and your minions force them to choose ,15,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,that fine anyone who is getting persnickety about this needs to stop and think they are not making it sex neutral the baby will still be male or female they are just making it easier for the person as an adult to decide their gender man or woman or perhaps something else i am personally not educated enough on the matter to know if there is a something else but i honestly do not see why there could not be and again this is not about the bodies physical sex it about gender which is all in our heads and our society and if you think i am attacking traditional values i am not saying gender is bad i am saying options are good and people should not be beholden to societies pearl clutching when it comes to a personal choice that affects no one but yourself ,-5,canada

Keypaw,zarya take the grenade talent that is a quest where you need to get a bunch of hits to finish it take the grenade talent that makes the middle of the grenade do more damage take the grenade talent at level 20 that gives all grenade stacks back too you everything else play with as you like but i like the shield two allies ability and the one that increases move speed for my melee assassins to chase i also like the ability that let you spend energy to make a new shield after your first shield is gone people think you are defenseless and blow all their skills on you this way you get to just absorb them mastering the grenade build you will be topping the damage for most of the game trust me ,2,Overwatch
Keypaw,hey i will play with you in quickmatch if you want i am pretty decent at the game and can help you out ,1,Overwatch
Keypaw,yeah hots loot boxes are way better ,9,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,oh wow they do not even include his name in the video description which i assumed they would just her name though google is clever it might pick up on the connection between her name and his name the old case and the new one and present this in results when researching the case in fact i am almost positive if the case itself is googled this will turn up ,20,videos
Keypaw,and that what everyone is ignoring she was 17 scared of an abusive mother and she told what she though was a lie without harm but they found the guy now she in deep more and more scared i am not saying let her off scott free but the people who are calling for her to pay millions of dollars which she would never ever be able too do or to put her away for 25 years have obviously never been in an abusive enough situation that you would say anything to avoid more abuse for the record i think this sentencing was too small as well as the 90 dollar compensation but i am no legal professional ,29,videos
Keypaw,yeah thanks to reddit that video will be at the top of any search for his name ,1,videos
Keypaw,i mean it probably going to catch traction thanks to reddit,22,videos
Keypaw,yeah that what people are missing here she made up a lie that she did not think would happen to protect herself from an abusive parent she may have been a young adult at that time but fear for oneself can drive you to do many things who knows what kind of abuse she lived through before this do i think she should be absolved of all guilt of course not she needs to be punished and i think more harshly than this this is bullshit the man lost 4 of his best years to this lie and there no way to bring that back but just because she made a huge fucking mistake does not mean it was not a mistake she was a scared young person who honestly thought the lie was harmless at first she deserves a bigger punishment but not this insane mob of internet do gooders who would see her life ruined while teeming with this seething hatred hate the justice system for allowing this kind of abuse hate the judge for sentencing that man so harshly with no evidence other than one person testimony hate this judge for being so lenient in her sentencing but pity her in her youth and her fear she told a lie and made a mistake that damaged someone life but she came forward she never ever had to do that she realized what she did was wrong and maybe she was able to get out of that environment of fear and that what empowered her to come forward i know people are going to pile on and hate on me for the sentiment that she too is a victim but i will stand by anyone with abusive parents oh but you are just taking her word about this like the judge did before about him assaulting her i am not i am not just taking her word i am taking her actions why would she come forward like that she knew it was wrong why then would she make up another lie to compound that one during her truths i feel her action of coming forward lends more weight to her testimony but obviously i could be wrong too i could be very wrong so before you jump down my throat with your pitchforks i just want to say it not our job to mete out justice do not turn her into some villain when you do not know the whole story let the courts do their job if you find it dissatisfactory the judge is a public servant write letters to people in power and people above her and let it be known that this judge is not serving the public will but if we vilify all criminal forever where then is the hope for rehabilitation as important as justice and punishment is so too is understanding and forgiveness i disagree with the sentencing but i also disagree with burning her at the stake as some posters seem to be metaphorically suggesting,-2,videos
Keypaw,well diablo entire game is just collecting more loot lol i am fine with that but legendary in ow is less than 2 despite having already paid for the game that disgusting ,8,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,wow that awful ,11,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i got banned there because one of their moderators had a username like autisticorangutang or something and he commented on a post in a fashion that lived up to his username so i said something like way to live up to your username haha,1,worldnews
Keypaw,mechanically represent how do you mean ,2,Pathfinder_RPG
Keypaw,cookies and cream for the ps2 not only is it skill based but you use only one hand and you play co op so you would actively be playing with your father i beat it with me mum should not be too hard to emulate it and get two usb controllers,1,gaming
Keypaw,i know you said you did not want to be a caster but consider the summoner archtype where you wear your eidlon like armour then make your eidolon materialize as your junk swirling around you and turn into a giant angry junk golem to fight that would be ballin and like you can be super angry because you always need to pick up all the junk after the eidolon dematerializes because he never puts it back that would also be an intersting weakness if you wanted to play it extra hard you cannot summon your eidolon without sufficient junk to tempt it into the real world so yeah you still get to play a smashy frontline brawler just a different flavour than you were thinking ,4,Pathfinder_RPG
Keypaw,azmodan easiliy i am level 55 with him but once you get good with him you own that lane ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,if they are suggesting you a hero that fine it good to build a comp that works with what you got i play tlv and zarya a lot and both are dependent on having more specific team comps them being angry after you and yelling at you if they do not like your pick is bullshit tho ,8,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i wanted to tie her into it actually but the only similar thing is summoning banelings and this is in a different fashion she actually summons roachlings and hunter killers so for the swarm the hyrda would be smaller and do less damage than zag hunter killer and the roaches would be bigger and sturdier by tie her in i mean make it evident they are the same race and part of a greater swarm ,1,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,yeah he and pam are best friends as for kreiger he was jewish so he faked is death and signed up with the nazi army so he could waste millions of their dollars on his projects so they could not buy more bombs and guns he joined the nazi so they would have less money to spend on the war despite being someone they would murder immediately if they found out ,8,ArcherFX

Keypaw, but there is almost no instance where taking boss is better than taking a fort this is one of those almost instances i mentioned ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,oops my bad replied to the wrong comment yeah it hard to convince a team of it eh ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,oh for sure i got a chuckle out of it myself it great art and the thing that makes me sad is the fan artist gave the characters more character than the show lol any newer anime you would recommend i watch ,1,todayilearned
Keypaw,also this panel is from the gutters webcomic by blind ferret ,2,Marvel
Keypaw,i was browsing through some of my submitted posts and i saw this one and it made me laugh again i hope it makes you all laugh again too ,2,Marvel
Keypaw,i watched the anime up to when they are running through the field with a lady titan chasing them or they are chasing her it fuzzy anyway the entire time i found the writing stilted and very generic anime that is not to say you are wrong for enjoying it of course but i have been watching anime since i was born and the characters just so often seemed copy and paste i could not get invested when generic anime dude 3 got eaten or was freaking out because he let other people get eaten i had already seen him in so many other anime that i just could not invest ya know the stoic emotionally dead characters hardly ever resonate with me and that was basically their cast take full metal alchemist there an anime with nuanced characters or more recently one punch man while having those same generic anime tropes one punch man leans into them mocking them and taking them apart i love it again i love attack on titan concept it animation is top tier the music is stellar and the voice actors are great but it the script that loses me the thing is i can see why people would love it because back in the day i loved inuyasha which has the same problems and strengths though i would like to think the inuyasha characters have slightly more personality that might just be nostalgia talking though haha ,2,todayilearned
Keypaw,yeah purely fan art those two characters are basically dead inside it a horror story of sorts set in a kind of feudal steampunk japan setting it a hugely unique concept just not incredibly well done ,1,todayilearned
Keypaw,attack on titan fan art it not cute at all very gory was super popular for awhile i found it was kinda poorly written ,2,todayilearned
Keypaw,yeah you have got to consider all of his abilities and qualities his w will wander off if it does not detect an enemy his laser has a small engagement range but he can chase with it and it can be talented to grow his health pool is as enormous as he is boasting one of the highest health pools in the game under cho gal full soul diablo and avatar muradin his w is there to deal some damage block skill shots and disrupt channels he is there to block skill shots that are heading into the back line and provide a body to watch the back of his tank bruisers ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,level 20 azmo here there azmodan was not so much on point with his timings as using the globes on cooldown luckily he had his minion spawnign from it to provide a second layer of poke but he is the one who lost them the game look at that team fight at the start of the video he barely in it at all his health stays pristine until his team starts to fall azmo is a mid line character he big with a big hp pool and autos that hurt a bunch plus his laser he should always be between the front line and back line but he was way back line where his hp pool his autos and his lasers were not worth anything ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,most often bottom is the solo lane most of the time because of saftey the rest of the time out of habit there are some maps you will see top lane solo but really the maps are super balanced so it does not matter too much ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,those are rare and far between and someone looking for abathur tips will not be able to recognize them ,4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,also bushes are not the only place to hide often there are curving walls and what not you and hide behind feel free to either spread your mines out for scouting info if you keep an eye on a mini map or fill your hidey hole and the area leading too it with them so someone coming to gank you get surprised also monstrosity is terrible compared to ultimate evolution your locus will push just fine and you will be more valuable in team fights especially with heroes like jaina her trait will combo with clone jaina ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,and of those skins the lost vikings still only have their original nine t t,61,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,you can also pick your domain first and then find which gods use that domain ,5,Pathfinder_RPG
Keypaw,she sounds quite lawful too me you see lawful is not following the law of the land it following a strict code your code is two fold 1 never murder an innocent 2 serve your master in this case your master is your addiction you do what ever you can to serve it you could easily play her as lawful and that might add some fun flavour for you ,2,Pathfinder_RPG

Keypaw,playing the game ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,nah common give like five shards i think one rare duplicate gives 20 so u madmax569 did the math and it turns out that you are doubling your chance to get rare in all of the boxes with one reroll as opposed to a 39 chance or something like that with the extra box one rare duplicate is worth the same as 4 common duplicates ,6,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw, u madmax569 did the math on it in a comment lower down check it out ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,because that not relevant to the conversation at hand brawls should have been giving xp from the start in most people opinions ,28,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yeah i figured that would be the actual value double that is too say but i was not sure of the math ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,you cannot because it random but you can compare the average value of one extra loot box vs four re rolls the four re rolls win everytime ,5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i think they were they same guys supposed to move in with me but they got lost on their way here ,20,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i was supposed to get three new roommates but they got lost on the way here ,9,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,nah just like on warhead you can hold three nukes each viking has their own f ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,not true i have played as them and each one can hold an item ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,oh man tlv are amazing on this map one player can rush a payload to the otherside on their own or they can split push soak with two guide a payload on their own and enable their team to kick ass they can grab three items dropping turrets and heals left and right you will see tlv grouped up more often than usual on this map that for sure but at the same time it because they are hitting camps ganking someone solo with how small the map is it super easy for tlv to gank finally very few heroes can handle all three vikings very few people realize this though which makes ganking so easy pushing carts scouting vision taking out a fort etc etc etc it so cool ,13,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i like all those things you are bemoaning but as someone who loves the lost vikings i might be biased this is my new favourite map because of how busy it is you are honestly doing it wrong if you are in lane for most of it even pushing seems a waste of time and i have a level 20 azmodan so i love my push it hectic bombastic and off the wall fun 10 10 would play hanamura again and again ,3,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,i mean since they did not even get a tint i unno ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yup this guy gets it you need someone who wont be kited while chasing the vikings because at least 2 will be hitting you while you are doing no damage chasing one and you need a way to keep yourself alive i am happy to see someone popped in here to back me up against people spreading miss information kael is only good against the vikings in that he can out lane one viking really really well kael is good as pve not pvv ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,man blizzard needs to give you a job already ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,just like zeratul ,75,Overwatch
Keypaw,that what i mean a vikings player with any level of micro will not be bothered by living bomb at all i have not had an issue with it since like level 8 i do not even take jump anymore ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,kael is one of the worst at fighting a good vikings player his abilities require an uncoordinated team to get the most effect and neither dehaka or arthas can do enough damage to land a finishing blow if you have your heart set on 1v1ing a clump of vikings someone like illidan or thrall or sonya people with sustain and decently high damage are what you need because the vikings will out last you though i would recommend against illidan and thrall if you can help it thrall is better off than illidan though ,8,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,as a level 19 viking in the old system not sure what 2 0 level i will have there are very few heroes that can take on all three vikings at once with the minimum of micro you would pickup from the starcraft training missions ,17,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,i did not delete anything and i never said hots was all rainbows and unicorns ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yeah whenever i play tlv i always say the secret of a great tlv player is not the play it how good his team is at playing with tlv like i will push the shit out of every lane and carry the entire game to victory if you let me but that the thing you need to let me i need a talented gank squad backing me up or i cannot do anything at all ,10,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,go for the vetran chest i need 35 levels and i am going for it much better value one extra item and it legendary guaranteed ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,another fun thing to do is not grab metamorph instead grab the hunt and pick off anyone dumb enough to solo lane there are very few characters that can take illidan 1v1 and quite often he can get a kill and escape during a 2v1 though going after someone like kael when they have etc with them is just dumb pick your battles but yeah i love both sonya and illidan and i choose illidan if i want more kills i choose sonya if i want more damage think of it like this sonya is way better at setting kills up for people like valla lunara kael etc illidan is better at sealing the deal after an enemy has been poked down enough he also awesome at supporting out of position allies iwith the hunt oh what is that zeratul is harassing my out of position support you are not prepared and illidan is one of the few people who can chase zeratul down after he blinks away ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,right ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i would not be able to run a 10v10 ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,this is very exciting i am very happy what blizzard has done in regards too their veteran players one thing i am concerned with is the gambling nature of this whole thing i get that it makes money but i am uncomfortable with the loot box system in general many players have already discussed the perils of gambling addiction in their own lives and the lives of family my question is how frequently will be be able to buy the skins we want to reduce the need to gamble for them obviously this is not the q a before someone climbs up my arse but i might not be here for it and if someone wants to post this question that would be great i have got two more questions that are more personal i will post below here but they are not as important the lost vikings where the love are there any skins in the works even just extra colour tints getting an eta on it would be great but i would honestly just really like to know if something at all is coming our way i love those guys their games helped me learn to read when i was young they have got a special place in my heart and another quesiton each other modern blizzard game hearthstone world of warcraft and diablo iii all have heroes of the storm mounts you can gain by progressing in game i was wondering if starcraft or overwatch would ever get something like that i understand an overwatch mount might be tricky since we are obviously never shown anything but something silly like a unicycle with a junkrat wheel would be awesome you can use the treasure goblin mount stature for it so yeah neither of these two questions are important but i think the first one is if someone could be swell enough to ask these questions for me in the q a that would be very nice ,13,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,oh nice yeah thats the kinda idea,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i love that song and as one of the whiners i would just like to say you are welcome ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,what does superstition do ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i was one of the people complaining this makes me much happier thank you blizzard for listening too us ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,the big bad corporation did not deserve all the pressure it got oh no you know what i love blizzard because it gives into pressure few companies do and it makes blizzard a better one because it listens guess what if a bunch of people complain about something a company does it not your place to tell them they are wrong and entitled the feel wronged for a reason and the company made them feel that way this right here this is blizzard doing it right thank you blizzard for stepping up for the little guy not many companies do that ,4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yeah i got 16 common boxes on beta and after a few games and more bixe,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,find heroes with a common theme but have different qualities illidan diablo and kharazim are all similar in positioning but different in use learn how to use them then learn how to use others like them illidan can help you learn greymane who can help you learn other ranged heroes diablo can help you learn etc or even rexxar kharazim will teach you when you need to use your heals and on whom which translates into other supports of course thats just what worked for me ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,honestly if you like playing the ptr at all i would suggest it it will give you a head start building stuff up it a good way to test to see if you would do better on a smurf account as well ,-1,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,i even prefer invasion it often catches folks off guard i also take the talent at seven that promotes a minion with your general love the split push again obviously i am not in competative levels or nothing but at plat i see huge sucess running him this way though everything else is the same i obviously take the forced recruitment at 20 double super catapults on core while you are all fighting on obj will win a game easy but that neither here nor there great post at the end of the day was just surprised to not see azmodan on the list ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i suppose i am only in plat not quite at competitive levels but i often go a w build and it works out amazingly ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i feel like azmodan might be someone you are missing from this list getting him to 20 he a very dominate solo laner,14,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,again we are in plat i am not saying anyone is great but my azmo is level 20 so i would like to think i play him above my level with other heroes ,1,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,honestly i am on your side you put all the effort into organizing this team you gathered them together if it was not for you they would probably not have even joined chairleauge if they wanted to replace you thats shitty but they have the right to pack up and leave you started this team because you wanted to play you out the effort in so you could play and practice it would be like if you made a baseball diamond for a big game and people decided you were not allowed to play on it for the big game ,7,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,fuck that shit if i was in a band i would wear that shirt all the time why my shirt say donkey cunt punch you ask well lemme tell you ,1,pussypassdenied
Keypaw,one question i would love to get an answer too is will starcraft players ever get a reward like a mount in heroes of the storm just for playing the game hearthstone has their card back for winning 100 games wow has ironside for reaching level 100 and diablo 3 has maelthels phantom for reaching level 70 with a seasonal character i know some people argue we have void speeder but thats for preordering and spending more money not playing the game we already love i was wondering if there ever be a reward like a zerfling mount or and overlord designed o be sat on like the treasure goblin ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i can answer the second half specialists were good at lane clearing and pve but thats just because of the ones released the real point of the specialist role is to put the characters that are too weird to fit elsewhere without it you would probably squeeze then into a variety of other roles but they would not quite fit ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i will be honest the fact that you are working on loosing weight would keep me around too but maybe for different reasons i do not mind gals on the bigger side anyway but just knowing they are working hard to improve themselves is one of the biggest turn ons i have been surrounded by people all my life who complain and never take action so you pushing yourself you seeing something you do not like about yourself and changing it that an amazing and beautiful thing about you even if it the long game and taking you a long time or you have set backs the fact you keep trying to improve it is seriously an awesome trait to have in a partner ,2,AskReddit
Keypaw,being tall oooh a love a man who is six feet nah i do not need any help i can get that myself you say as you reach to the top shelf where the employee needed a step stool just so they could stretch and maybe almost knock it down with their finger tips but houses are not built for us or cars straight up if you ever go on a drive more than 20 minutes with a tall person give them shotgun so they can push the seat back please or public transit if you ever see a man sitting kinda sideways so he sorta taking up two seats worth of space he almost certainly is not doing it to be a dick and if you try to sit next to him he will straighten out but just know you are condeming him to smacking his knees against the hard metal plastic of the seats in front of you and the reason he does not just stand is because he got to bend down so as not to hit the ceiling for every bump in the road you will always be called on to get that high thing off the shelf even though you are relaxed and doing what ever in another room it just easier for you to grab it than for me to get the step stool out and use that and pants dear god the pants good fucking luck finding anything with longer than a 32 leg but still reasonably fitted for your waist shirts are also difficult the big and tall shop is quite literal it not big or tall no you get something with the right sleeve and torso length and then you realize it looks like you are wearing an elephant discarded skin for how baggy it is on you but lord help you if you shop in the regular person section looks like a regular person shopping in the kids section and honestly i could go on and on but i will let other tall folks respond with their own issues i would not trade being tall for being average but there are way more cons than pros it just one of the few things that makes me feel special story time i was short until junior high where i grew from like 5 4 to 6 3 over the course of like grade 8 9 growing pains suck it literally your bones growing faster than your muscles and ripping them to fit but that not the story the story is funnier i was not used to being giant so i would constantly walk into street signs that i used to be able to walk under just like for a year and half constantly walking into them because they were just above eye level for me but not forehead level ,2,AskReddit

Keypaw,if you honestly have players that cause that much of a ruckus they are not looking for a fun fantasy adventure game they are just looking to argue to make themselves look superior ,1,worldbuilding
Keypaw,yeah man go for it the thing about evolution and physics in these worlds is there are literally dozens of creation stories for the different races and creatures and upside down flowing waterfalls that you can directly ask a god and your god will respond there very little room for people to refute that trexes would not live in this part of the world alongside modern deer when bobo the god of doesntgiveashitaboutyouropinion decides hea going to do that and make the trexes opera singers while looking your character in the eye that and you are the final arbiter of even those gods you are king of the world you can make a new god who does all these things if you want you could literally add bobo or you can just make rocks fall from the sky until your players agree with you,1,worldbuilding

Keypaw,yeah i know your pain in my case i would not fuse my main with anyone who would push him above a rank and i would just use low level people often a rank or lower try fusing chaitzu and tien for a super cool powerful but not op character he honestly has one of the best character designs chaitzu and guldo also makes a super cute cool guy but that almost post game content honestly i just love all of chiatzu fusions even though i hate chiatzu haha,1,DBZFusions

Keypaw,here the thing he chose you if it causes you too much stress for him to see her you need to end it but he likes her hell he might still have a crush on her but he chose you the thing is love and attraction is not a binary you are in love and attracted to this person or they are my platonic friend there are so many layers but at the end if the day he chose you if you think he will cheat with her then you think he will cheat with anyone but just because he attracted to other people and he is does not mean he would want to betray you for them he wants you more than anyone else thats why he is with you but he still has friends and he probably attracted to several people often make friends with people who are about as attractive as them selves but people usually try to date up so he can see an attraction and appeal too this person but she is less than you in his eyes do not another his friendship but instead reinforce your relationship do not tolerate any betrayal or foolishness do not punish natural attractions or crushes you cannot help who you are attracted too but he wants a romance and future with you until he makes you think otherwise ,0,relationships

Keypaw,to all of the people saying that it would make them a hots hero no it would not here is how i would do it release an overwatch comic have the character discussing with one of the main cast in ways they think they could help overwatch or maybe just talking about how awesome it would be to be a superhero or some such i make this character a giant nerd with collectables scattered through their home from nerdy properties like blizzard games and overwatch stuff they fall asleep and begin dreaming of themselves in a battlesuit with an awesome weapon they have never seen before but they are in the nexus battling characters and monsters from all the games they have known about for years but now its a battle to the death they wake up from their dream was it really a dream maybe have a gift from tyrande fall out of their pocket and roll under a couch so you are left to winder if it is another collectable or an actual artifact from azeroth and are inspired they use their engineering knowhow to produce the same gear they wielded while in the nexus they call their friend again and tell them give me a few months i have an idea release this hero in hots first you are playing them in their dream then release them in overwatch they were introduced in overwatch first via a comic so the character is actually from overwatch ,1,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,i am all for him sharing that side of himself in the right context the context of this scene was not a bonding one though and they do not know one another very well yet as for discoving he gay i think it could be something as simple as he talks about a date he went on the night before and how great the guy was just common back and forth talk rather than busting out this out of no where i do not know if you read the issue but myself and many others seem to feel it was placed after the fact by someone higher up than the writer someone just saying let make sure people know we have a gay person in this comic add this panel because the writing for this chracter is top notch otherwise so that another thing that makes it weird he very professional and like just two panels before this was asked to call her by her first name because again he works for her i have met many gay people who joke around like this with their friends or in social situations but not in the office helping your boss you barely know out of the building because she just had a panic attack ,0,Marvel
Keypaw,yes but that does not make the lines okay either i like good writing and i especially think that under represented groups need good writing to depict them now the iceman and romeo relationship is cringe worthy in xmen but that because they are teenage boys so it cringe worthy in a realistic way and i love it this on the other hand is kind of insulting and not because of what he said but rather how and when it was said ya know he is a very good character in ever other instance even those immediately leading up to this point i honestly feel this was included after the fact by someone other than the writer ,1,Marvel
Keypaw,oh god that awful i read that but i did not remember it i actually like how they did him and romeo it a cute young teen relationship that just happens to also be a gay one it really works but having another person declare you are full gay kinda takes some of the agency out of it like he his own man i know she a mind reader so she can know but it shitty she took all the inner conflict and questioning out of him like that also we need more bi characters ,3,Marvel
Keypaw,oh yeah my bad,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i suggest you buy the book hulk 2 it is really good but for context she suffered a panic attack he is walking her out of the building being a supportive coworker explaining if she ever needs anything he here for here its all very well written exactly what you would expect in that kind of delicate situation then they drop this panel in as the last of their interaction no build up no nothing then nothing afterwards she on the street by herself ,2,Marvel
Keypaw,thats intentional they made it more of a skill shot to make it harder to poke with but they buffed it in other waya,-4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw, you have been dropped and then being forced to restart the entire client whereas when you actually get dropped because of your own connection it just recconects you like normal ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yes yes this is why i posted this i want diversity much like ms marvel i love her character but i want good diversity i want the characters treated with the same care and respect as their straight white counter parts like they did with ms marvel you get to see her family and her culture in a context appropriate fashion not just like her declaring in one panel all the things that make her diverse and interesting i really love how they did her ,3,Marvel
Keypaw,is that a reference to something ,1,Marvel
Keypaw,she does not even react with humour she takes it as a face value comment if they made jen laugh even a single like the kind of amused sigh you make when someone tells a pun that would have been better but the panel just feels out of sync with the rest of the story thanks for bringing up tracer by the way her reveal was perfect they treated her like a normal human being as opposed to a token or a joke like souch of media pulls on lgbtq characters tracer is my favourite modern example no fan fare just her going home to her girlfriend so they can get ready to visit their gorilla buddy and the best thing about all of that is nothing in that sentances is weird because of how they treat their characters including winston sure he an ape but he just a nornal dude sure she a lesbian but she just a normal lady because being gay is normal i will always appreciate blizzard for that one ,-5,Marvel
Keypaw,i am not sure what side you are taking here i am saying this as a man who enjoys the occasional penis that i want better inclusion this character is really good and had they just approached him like a human being instead of their token gay character he would have made an amazing token gay character instead now he feels like he was put in just to check off a box and that makes me sad ,2,Marvel
Keypaw,to a boss you barely know coming down from a panic attack that you know has super powers based on anger ,-2,Marvel
Keypaw,i think posts about this bug need to make it to the front page every time they come up because it not on your end when you get this you have been dropped bug that only lets you leave and restart the game when it on your end it reconnects like normal and blizzard has not acknowledged this yet ,4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,amadeus is the totally awesome hulk but the hulk on going stars jennifer walters she hulk hah i would love it if he was a super gay symbiote that would be awesome he in it before as a well written character a coworker a subordinate who is professional and cares about his boss then the crapped out that panel for some reason very out of the blue for his character i fell like it was less a writer choice and more of a we need diversity make him say he gay choice from the higher ups ,4,Marvel
Keypaw,i think super gay secretaries would be the we he was referring too either that or he and jen the writing for that panel does not flow very well with the rest of the issue ,5,Marvel
Keypaw,which is a huge bummer but oh well ,-3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yes exactly and i bet you won that game by a landslide following that even if you are way behind before that moment the chance they could come back is so far away,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,r plumbing,2,gaming
Keypaw,i do not mean that azmodan is pushing uncontested but he can beat anyone solo lane if done right and it not even strictly azmo it whomever you have as off lane ,-5,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,actually i am at 200 won 200 lost pergame haha,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,what about the gay police officers who enjoy participating in this parade to show that there are gay members of the community who also protect the community who are no banned from participating in this celebration as their career it literally telling them to keep quiet about who they are or they will be excluded and shunned ,40,canada
Keypaw,are you having fun enjoy the content if no it is below your standards proceed to complain if you get upvoted people agree if you do not people disagree ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,and if i recall it was really strong with a short range,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,he saying devs should not be above scrutiny when something they push out is below standards ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,if you want to solo lane as him now you need to take the mana ablity so you can self spam shields and storms ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i think it disgraceful people are downvoting this this is a persistant bug that has been effecting the community since the zarya patch and should be on the front page every day because neither here in this subreddit nor in the offical blizzard forums has there been a comment on it by one of the blues ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,nope both exist in the comics and have very different properties captain america shield is one of the few things that made of a hybrid of the two a feat commonly thought impossible ,2,marvelstudios
Keypaw,this this is what i mean sherlock is a damaged man john is such a close friend his first since his childhood when john goes to mary he thinks he loosing his friend but a man cannot be vulnerable without it being gay love so obviously his relapse is because he in love with john and not because he feeling abandoned by a friend starting a new chapter of his life that the one song we know he wrote and he is a virgin yeah of course the equate it because sherlock is not close to anyone until john comes along and then sherlock becomes very close to him this is what hurts me about this this is what i mean by toxic masculinity obviously the must be gay because they cannot possibly be emotionally vulnerable this kind of thing makes me sick as a man with feelings who wants to have the kind of close friendship i see in sherlock i know i will probably never have it because of the way our society views male vulnerability ,31,Sherlock
Keypaw,i do not remember the girlfriend thing but i always got from it that irene was teasing john,12,Sherlock
Keypaw,vibranium only stops things with energy or momentum he could easily slowly pull his arms apart there a scene in one of the punisher comics where a guy uses an energy shield with the same properties as vibranium and brags that nothing the punisher hits him with will every be able to penetrate it so the punisher laments the fact that he will need to slowly inch his knife through the shield repeatedly ,17,marvelstudios
Keypaw,and tarrasque baseline ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,hi guys level 17 tlv player here can flex into any role etc and diablo for tanks sonya artanis and thrall for brusiers kerrigan and illidan for melee dps kharazim and morales for support valla raynor sylvanas lunara zul jin tracer for ranged dps zagara and azmodan for split lanes xul and murky for double soaking on bhb and tomb leoric zarya butcher abathur and cho for situational flex picks and of course tlv for winning on just about every map https www hotslogs com player herooverview playerid 611405 alabaster 1763,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,or you could let people complain about things they do not like in an online game that constantly gets updates so the devs can see these complaints realize how big of an issue it is for the community and allow it to work for positive change in that direction ,8,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,well that the real reason,4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yeah i love the aa build if they have a lot of squishy heroes i take banshee but i usually grab hyperion for the zoning potential if your team is being chased fire hyperion down the path you will be running that way it follows you and gives you covering fire ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yup i always go with the two assimilation talents plus the ravage heal just to feel like i can keep myself alive,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,she stabs people with them when she jumps super high she also uses them to grip walls ,5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,he super fulfilling once you nail it a tip for the laning phase never attack enemy minions just auto the enemy hero if it zagara kill the hydra then go back to autoing them but do not chase just try to zone them out of xp soak range like the furtherst you should ever stand is at the back of their minion wave your extra range allows you to dance at the edge of their sanity ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,hah yeah she stressful ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,oh man auriel gets me too like i have seen amazing auriels and i just do not get it like how are you healing that much it incredible she probably my worst support and that saying something ,5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,oh yeah anyone micro is easy in lane or on camps but when you are in a 5v5 it hectic as hell ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw, and how is producing a tank every 15 seconds different from grabbing mercs on re spawn or efficiently soaking xp or bribe stacks different from harvesting resources moving to capture an altar different than building a vulnerable expansion or capturing a warhead different than building one macro is a very important part of heroes of the storm a purely micro game would be something like geometry wars ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,you do need to micro them but i am talking about knowing when it best to have olaf grabbing the siege camp or being in lane when it best to have baelog holding the objective or in the team fight when you should have eric in a bush to scout or gathering globes tlv has a lot of macro knowledge necessary to pull them off i find their micro is much easier than illidan ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,anad ,1,Marvel
Keypaw,thank you it the same with my wonder billie if blizzard wanted to re release her i would be just fine with that ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,and you had it for two years longer than everyone else who got it they never said they would not re release these things ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,right haha i would like to think my advice is the advice you would use most of the time on the map but i know it not an all the time thing ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,thank you everyone seems to be piling in here with their umm well actually you are stupid comments and bringing up the specific scenarios in which it is better to get the boss this is obviously not a comprehensive strategy guide for towers of doom haha,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i am proud to say i have 100 winrate as azmodan on that map i mean i am level 20 with him so i am probably not an average azmo player but i still get excited everytime i see that map ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,lol again i think antagonize him was wrong but fucking savage ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,obviously if you cannot see them they are back at core ,5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,nope the two closest looking things are warcraft mounts the eyepad for the old gods and the legion exclusive donkey demon wolf thing ,7,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,lol i am u keypaw,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i learned this in customer service,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,that usually true obviously if he tilts this easily he loses a lot of games but he still at your rank he doing something right i never thought of it like this ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,that actually a great idea for a new style of mount spheres zagara shoots banelings btw https www youtube com watch v fzmhh8zhtiy,16,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yup i often find it turns around if you can convince them to stop and your way is the best way too the only problem is they do not all listen ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,then you are in the situation that i discuss and there nothing you can do ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,was not expecting any gold thank you kindly truth be told i assumed i would be downvoted into obscurity ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,the other three who are hoping that 20 will pay off ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yup they can stop the bullshit just by being quiet but they wont silence their own sense of justice that way they are the good guy mean while the other three just lost a game so the other person could feel like he fought the good fight ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,is that your official title ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,honestly just summed up my entire rant in two lines well done ,7,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,dragonshire is the bomb i love it i always take the eric stealth at level 1 and sit him on the furthermost corner of the dragon shrine it hilarious to watch people attempt to capture it ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,that not what i am saying at all ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,it is replies like this that make me love posting these kinds of threads i see people like you and i can just say to myself this guy gets it ,6,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yes very much so ,0,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,oh i think so too this post is just going out to those ones that provoke the trolls even further ,5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,and momentum that the key there you are up a fort while they are taking it you can take a different fort they are doing less damage on shrines they have less room to run away or circle around for attacks it not so much the damage benefits as the strategic ones ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,that just my line of trying to convince people that if you need to say it wait until everything is done ,4,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,or you can say sorry and not mean it to get on with your life because taking some righteous stand and losing the game is not worth it a good skill to have is to learn how to pick your battles i do not feel like chewing out some random over the internet for a bad choice that he could have made for any number of reasons making his day worse leading him to make my day worse ,-3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yes my advice is obviously not a catchall no advice is there will always be times you need to use critical thinking but by and large this is good advice ,17,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,man i admit i would have done the exact same thats a very strong team composition ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yup that why you mute them and tell the others too as well arguing will never win you the game i am willing to speak up once if he argues back i just stop ,0,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,what ,3,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,err i meant sc broodwar lol my bad but yeah what i mean is he never really had any support esque traits especially now that his more iconic form is the sc2 version ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,is not he a ghost battlecruiser in sc2 ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i thought they would make a great third ult at level ten you take fang and you get the werewolf with a life steal on auto attack as a fourth tlv to control and then at level 20 you take and scorch and you get the dragon with a dot burn effect as a fifth each time every vikings respawn counter increases by ten seconds mad micro for days ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,i love this concept it fits him way better than the support build i read for him awhile back instead of the spine crawler though i would give him the infested tank he gets as a custom unit in his co op version ,56,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,nice you should reach out to the community i am sure there are talented folks who would love to help ,1,RoleIt
Keypaw,sounds good my man if you want to add me as mod of the forums or something i would love to chip in i opened the december lfg thread and i would be happy to do one each month but as for web design my idea was pretty simple display the image of the map as a background and just add buttons in reach region that players can click on to get information about the region it way better than looking at a list and trying to line it up with the map makes it more real ya know like someone can click on this country read about it and rather than look for their neighbors in some alphabetical ordered list where they are seperated and it seems kind of disjointed they are just right next to each other so it easier to visualise also and wood and brass colour scheme would make the site look great and fantasy esque ,2,RoleIt

Keypaw,i hate that people down vote these threads because they are tired if seeing them the only way we will get blizzard to acknowledge us and this issue is to address it over and over to uovote and draw attention too it and to report it to customer service time and time again its been happening too me since the zarya patch and i think thats the earliest i have heard if it happening something happened during that patch that has been getting worse with every major patch since ,41,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,it even better that he infested hah,5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,yes he is hated by unskilled players or by players used to folks forcing him into a team comp but if you draft well as one of the last two picks draft into your team so with heroes he works with two solo lane heroes in the party etc and play him to the best of your ability it should be fine if you can fet an ally in the draft by being very excited when you see their pick ooh an illidian eh badass you will make my aba shine basically say that to any melee assassin and other will be less likely to jump on you for your pick because now there two people in the yay aba camp and people who play melee assassins are very vain and love the thought of having an aba hat source level 9 illidan and butcher lol also a tip during objectives get into the lane farthest from the objective and soak the xp with your body and use your hat to either push and soak a second lane or help your team ,5,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,with the demand for supports i see zul jin coming out as the first debuff support harming the enemies rather than buffing the allies that will add more diversity too the support pool plus give us a unique role not yet filled though i do think he will have big bad voodoo all allies in a radius are invincable you are not from warcraft 3 and probably his serpant wards places an attacking ward somewhere in a large radius around him good for scouting and gives a different flare than gazlowes turrets chain heal rehgar inherited that and hex aoe poly morph they might add it as a skill shot i doubt will see the light of day unless hex comes in as an ult ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,another way to do it is if you are at full health when shadow stalk triggers you gain bonus damage to the amount that would be healed on your next auto attack that plays to her theme of being a damage support and gives you a reason to use it as a ganking tool before the fight starts ,11,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,i would love to see what people come up with but two thoughts i had were seeing the main character being driven insane by the foolishness of everyone else like we as viewers often are or the main character using these awesome new powers becomes the talk of the town think the invention of lying but with common human decency ,3,WritingPrompts

Keypaw,you would be out of q range easy if he out of your laser range and by the time he hunts you your cooldown on laser will be back up and it start all over only now illidan does not have his ult ,1,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,then he backs off in the opposite direction until his cooldown is fixed or he chases you depending on the terrain you have fought in ,2,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,laser build azmodan would like a word ,21,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,then you are playing in a different league than op and the vikingnplayer will be able to respond in the way i described it is very easy to lightly harass two lanes and keep olaf alive if your allies are keeping pressure on in ops league with a viking of that level his plan works just fine but there a reason vikings are viable and its because as simple as this counter play seems its never that simple ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,he only got two lanes to cover because of his split baelog and olaf are bottom vs eric this guy is obviously a new vikings player even if the skin was not a give away that nothing against him but that why vikings are such a high skill cap you need to be able to control all three but you can tell he does not even check on eric more than once or twice after he sits him in the gate ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,as someone who plays vikings that wo not work for someone like dehaka that eric can kite him all day and should have been peppering him with attacks if it was a tanged hero or he was against olaf yes that is an okay strategy but even then with micro olaf can soak run heal since he has the muradin trait baelog can do the harass thing like eric just not as well ,5,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,their sunglasses are amazing and it only 5 bucks more to tint them you can even pick the colour though they do have transition options too expensive for me and mirrored which look rad as hell and i use my glasses for driving and reading so i would say you are probably good ,7,television
Keypaw,do it if i can even put one more customer onto them i would be glad i do kinda owe them ,4,television

Keypaw,as someone who loves specialist heroes naz is just an unwieldy assassin he does great damage but no burst he has great wave clear but his sustain is not strong his crowd control is cool in concept but easily countered unless you are on his team then it the best cc in the game a great nazeboo will be amazing a good nazeboo will be okay an okay nazeboo will be bad and a bad nazeboo will literally kill his teammates and if you are amazing with nazeboo you are probably pretty great with some better heroes ,50,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,laser isnt as strong as it used to be with bound minion being on the same tier as march turning you into a one trick pony where it used to be zoning teamfights and pushing it now just zoning but any map where you need to hold a location skytemple for instance or blackharts or any map that narrow and hard for people to run from you tomb or the between lane areas of dragon shire for example it super powerful vs the like of illidan or thrall very few heroes can out duel you and high level players know this so once you drop a laser they run away giving you an escape or if they do not you get a kill if they have plenty of stuns even micro stuns do not risk it just buff your demon warriors and push to win ,1,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,that pretty neat i could see building a class around this class skill start each round drawing a card as you level up you can add multiple draws make it so you are able to draw from a specific suite at will by specializing in it another ability to draw an extra card as a move action etc actually i might make a custom class like that using this deck of yours it becomes less random the higher level you are whereas at low levels you are either mighty or middling ,5,DnD
Keypaw,nah i like the idea that any mage can make one card a day via a ritual and once all 52 are assembled you are good to go so like it wont be super common because not everyone has 52 days a year to spend making one but there will be a few floating around ,3,DnD

Keypaw,i just find it weird that so many comics are talking about the fight as though it in progress ,2,Marvel
Keypaw,no no i figured it out i designed a rak hir concept basically they fight in the middle the whole time and you try to build a big minion clump then after a set timer the clump all dies whomever had the biggest clump wins who ever gets five wins wins the game this would make farming mercs and wave clear very important though this way there is no push to one end of the map or another ,1,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,d va is the most likely in my opinion but she would probably not make it in until after fenix because of death mechanics being a thing they do not want to dump too many of it why we do not already have fenix because they really want to do a death mechanic with him ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,this would actually get me interested in kael,6,heroesofthestorm

Keypaw,a good azmo will tear down any lane with a single viking though ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,falstadd can fly next to and kill any viking maybe not olaf even with imediate dash response azmodan can push erics lane in so hard the xp stays the same and the viking team is down a lane as a viking main those are the two characters i hate the most thrall greymane and lunara are also hassels illidan can do good work ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,not gold though you would have people spamming for gold but maybe you get 10 gold every five commendations you put out like this would encourage you to commend someone every game even if it was an enemy for some solid plays because your team was a swinging bag of dicks this would now encourage you to play just one more game ,15,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,a commendation system that you could not use on friends would be great with a portrait reward for ten of each different commendation you get ,35,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,you are right just look at the shitty apartment archer grew up in ,5,ArcherFX
Keypaw,if any hero is played right they seem op you ever play against a good viking ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,there is no set definition for specialist azmodan has two wildly different builds laser for team fight and lane pushing globe for wave clear and sniping fleeing enemies and he is different from abathur who has mines gank hat support and locus lane push who is again wildly different from the vikings constant global pressure as opposed to abathurs regular global pressure because someone e will call me on it who are different from gazlowe amazing at mercs and zoning out fights who is different from slyvanas highly mobile dps with abilities for disrupting the enemy team who is different from murky a lane pushing pseudo tank annoyance etc etc but none of these people fit into any of the other set roles one thing they can usually do is push well but depending on yourself and your build you might be built for that ,6,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,as an azmo main yes ,1,heroesofthestorm
Keypaw,hah mine too thy will be done ,2,Overwatch
Keypaw,hah there are people who expected to get in because they bought diablo back when the first game came out i understand your disappointment i lived it myself up until this weekend who your favourite hero i will play a game for you i will even yell a war cry of your choosing followed by for slimabob i will die but i will do it ,2,Overwatch
Keypaw,that is not what i am saying i have been applied since the start and i did not say anything negative i am speaking up now because when i was accepted i came here to celebrate with people only to find a torrent of negativity and anger sent after blizzard i shared that piece of information for transparency sake and people can be disappointed sure people can have frustrations of course but the arguments i continue to see and the ones i direct this message towards are the i am better than these other people who got in the beta because i actually love blizzard these people are the ones who are not trying to look at how blizzard produces overwatch but rather feeling victimized for being left out despite their obvious superiority as a consumer ,-1,Overwatch
Keypaw,you are allowed to be disappointed but i was just using this post to talk about the nasty angry salty but i spend all the money i ever earn on blizzard swag i deserve this people like you mentioned ,2,Overwatch
Keypaw,you are allowed to be disappointed i wish it was an open beta but i was just using this post to talk about the nasty angry salty but i spend all the money i ever earn on blizzard swag i deserve this people ,2,Overwatch
Keypaw,exactly they do not care so much about you as they do your region rig in this case those are very unique and valuable metrics for them ,2,Overwatch
Keypaw,it not even that they 100 put some of those people in like i preordered but that the thing they want some of everyone ,-2,Overwatch
Keypaw,this is a perfect idea make them fell orcs though and you are onto something great i would buy this legend skin in a heart beat,35,heroesofthestorm
