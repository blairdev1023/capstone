MetalRetsam,the holy roman empire like other states of its time circa 800 1806 was a feudal state before the modern centralized state with its professional bureaucracy sovereign kings and emperors needed another way to manage the huge swathes of land they owned this was done through personal ties running an empire is a tricky business and lots of jobs need to be filled early emperors would distribute these jobs to their vassals for certain obligations in return so called privileges each estate a certain group of people would negotiate their rights and obligations with their immediate lord these privileges ran from the right to run a market on saturdays to tax exemption to purely ceremonial titles that came with prestige and were known as german freedoms one very important privilege was imperial immediacy direct vassalage to the emperor and a certain sense of autonomy initially these were mainly dukes and margraves but their numbers grew over the centuries so much so that by the 16th century new regional administrative divisions needed to be set up hundreds by the empire end possibly thousands of course feudal ties are famous for being inherited and this became the practice quite quickly after the establishment of the empire as successive emperors declined in power relative to their vassals there were also ecclesiastical church territories but since you could not properly inherit those we will leave them for what they are initially the empire was supposed to consist of various kingdoms which consisted of various duchies and duchy level titles which consisted of counties etcetera however as we saw with imperial immediacy this system was not static the kingdom level titles were kept in the carolingian family leading to civil wars whenever more than one son inherited it was later decided that the emperor would own all the kingdom titles even those like burgundy that had a very tenuous link to the empire by that point the exception was the kingdom of germany which would occasionally be handed down to designated successors as imperial coronations were kind of a big deal and difficult to plan and national unity tended to be less than perfect around succession time the expectant emperor was always crowned king of germany immediately to ease tension in time the german title became associated with the empire there were other problems with this system it was extremely difficult to rise in the social ranks the stability of the empire depended on the rigidity of its structure after all influential counts and dukes were not happy with this and many desired an upgrade call it title inflation if you will occasionally it worked as with the duchy of bohemia which became a kingdom in 1198 after the tumultuous early centuries of the empire however it became increasingly important to affirm the age old hierarchy and it became legally impossible for another kingdom to exist in the empire this was especially helpful since the ruling dynasty the habsburgs inherited the bohemian title along the way uniting all the kingdoms once more the electors margraves with the added privilege of formally voting for the emperor in practice a traditional confirmation of brandenburg inherited the duchy of prussia which was under polish jurisdiction and lay outside the empire after becoming independent from poland and being a rising regional power in central europe the dukes of brandenburg prussia saw their chance and pressed the pope to elevate them to kings kings in prussia not kings of prussia this may seem like a minor detail but it was a huge deal at the time no kings in the hre prussians happy wars happened in the hre but conquering stuff was tricky brandenburg prussia expanded mostly through inheritance i think especially in the early years their conquest of the silesia a habsburg territory 1740s and various parts of poland together with the habsburgs and romanovs 1770s 90s were something of a breakthrough then napoleon attacked and everything changed napoleon called himself emperor of the french because still there was no empire of france title created the confederation of the rhine as a puppet successor to the now moribund empire and presented an ultimatum to the emperor who disbanded the empire and translated his title to his personal territory austria hungary prussia who fought valiantly in the napoleonic wars was rewarded with huge territorial gains the story is not over yet the german part of the empire was succeeded by a confederation consisting of 39 now consolidated states now the austrian prussian rivalry began in earnest both wanted to unite germany under their own leadership catholic or protestant gradually prussia began to win influence the areas it had gained over the past century proved to be rich in coal which was great in the burgeoning industrial revolution they presided over a zollverein a customs union allowing the free transport of goods and services through germany which considering the miniature size of some of the states was preferable to the alternative when the rivalry came to a head in the 1860s the confederation split up in two north and a southern alliance north won all states bar austria were integrated into the new german empire yet another successor to the hre yet even here we see the heritage of hre because empire consisted of various territories duchies and kingdoms and counties that were the descendants of those old old feudal states even though the aristocracy was ousted in 1918 in favor of democratic states and the short lived communist states of bavaria and reuss the latter of which i can only imagine was fed up with centuries of following a regnal numbering that was arcane even for hre standards the state infrastructure prevailed right into the weimar republic with some minor changes thankfully seven states merged to form thuringia in 1920 leaving 16 states and 3 free and hanseatic cities the nazis finally reorganized them as they did with everything between 1933 and 1935 with one more reorganization at the end of the war prussia was officially abolished in 1947 ,1,history

MetalRetsam,the problem with new paradox gsg ips is that all the interesting eras of dynamic conquering are covered paradox games are based around maps and the most interesting maps are the ones that change hence the middle ages sengoku japan the early modern era the napoleonic wars victorian times and world war ii most history that paradox has not covered is pretty static mapwise so where to go from here the answer lies for a part in the games themselves each franchise plays to a different niche ck is about feudal ties eu is empire management vicky is economics and government systems hoi is a war simulator and stellaris is space ideally you would need to find a fresh angle i think a capitalism based gsg similar to ck2 but set in the history of the united states would be interesting or one based around the holy roman empire and its estates a religion based gsg could be very interesting though potentially controversial maybe a more politically oriented victoria that starts in 1750 but you cannot zoom in too far or you lose that grand aspect if a paradox game is not totally overwhelming at first glance it not doing its job correctly ,1,paradoxplaza

MetalRetsam,what i cannot understand is how you equate sociological changes with genetic ones i am not saying there no genetic variation between peoples i am saying that it purely cosmetic after all tens of thousands of years is a blip on the evolutionary timescale natural selection takes ages to work out and what are the different groups you are talking about by and large europeans are descended from the same three waves of migrations what did the dutch have that the english or the prussians or the finns or the neapolitans did not have ,1,history
MetalRetsam,i see you sure you are not willing to discuss with me this is not meant to be some sort of personal attack you know do not you like your ideas to be challenged once in a while if you are sure you are right you have got nothing to worry about and if you are not you might learn a thing or two as well best case scenario we both learn your take on genetics is so unorthodox where did you pick it up ,1,history
MetalRetsam, yes i am the sort of person who thinks all people are equal and the only differences are circumstances and besides genetic differences on an individual level do not translate to a societal level certainly not if that society happens to be one of the busiest corners of the european continent even if the dutch were ever at any point markedly genetically different from their neighbors which is ridiculous then the centuries of interaction with their neighbors that preceded the golden age would have annihilated that the dutch were never isolated as a people at any point in history and with the countless invasions in european history you could hardly call their bloodline pure which you do not but is pretty much a prerequisite if you want to talk about genetic exceptionalism urbanization and evolution have nothing to do with one another one is the random mutation of genes over millions of years the other is people living in larger communities natural selection is neither quick nor accurate enough to be the cause for anything at all in history urban communities attract art and science because that where the money is patrons with a disposable income people willing to show off their wealth and good taste by promoting the arts and sciences and still all of these things have nothing to do with op question which are economic and political in nature areas in which human agency not genetics is a prerequisite how does urbanization give more ways for the talented to express themselves and what does that have to do with evolution genetics has nothing to do with economics economics is rooted in sociology and sociology is universal culture is circumstantial never innate ,1,history
MetalRetsam,i that not how genes work like not even remotely the dutch of this period were taller and better educated but that down to nutrition and education policy not to innate genetic ability urbanization during this time certainly did not lead to physical advantages in fact one was much more likely to die in the city with all those diseases squirming around not a healthy place genetics also does not explain politics and economics which is what is in the question ,1,history

MetalRetsam,we are talking about someone who needs a basic introduction to american history here so when i say all of it i mean there a couple of key points he needs to know about indigenous history and cultures and that these are spread out from an indeterminate time in the past you say 15 000 years up until and including today these are in my opinion pre columbian indigenous cultures were rich and diverse their societies complex columbus feeble grasp on geography and the unfortunate naming convention that resulted the various relationships that existed between natives and colonizing powers promised land and broken treaties the trail of tears and the indian wars reservations and the residential school system the resurgence of indigenous culture and languages in recent years indigenous activism and emancipation in the 20th and 21st centuries there might be a couple more examples that do not neatly fit into these categories especially if you start including america colonization in the pacific but if you are trying to dispel the cartoon image of the red indian this is a good place to start ,7,history

MetalRetsam,piggybacking on this comment because you seem to have a lot of good ideas what i like about paradox games is their historical basis the fact that they are grounded in the real world that where they have got the upper hand over games like civilization which is more abstract in terms of history yes it alternate history from the moment you start playing because we should not forget the history part of that i am fine with secret societies and brotherhoods and all that da vinci code shit cause that just cool but the heart of the games is strategy and strategy means survival you look at a map of the middle ages and what do you see a collection of fallen states from the early northumbria to the middle burgundy to the late the hre paradox games are full of the states that did not make it because they failed to adapt with the times only the few and the fortunate make it france castile and down the ages only in modified form no capets on the throne anymore at the same time it anyone game luxembourg and san marino managed to survive despite all odds so it obviously not impossible there no abbasidblob in real life today even the mongols legendary though they were eventually fell the player however has a basic sense of history which might give them the upper hand in some cases what is the idea choices long term benefits versus short term benefits expansion means more resources but it comes at a price focusing your energies on prosperity might be better for the land and its people but you might be too wrapped up in that to notice your cousin with that dagger behind the curtain republics are more stable if you have the income to maintain them specializing your military units might give you an advantage today but where will things stand in fifty years time you may fight in jerusalem for god and glory but you cannot control the troubles at home that way every decision has good consequences and bad ones but you know the beats of history when the mongols come you submit when the plague arrives you flee to the countryside the player needs to find the right balance between specialization and adaptability you may have the most splendorous court this world has ever lain eyes upon if you do not bear a son in time it might all be up for grabs within a decade do you oppose or embrace christianity islam whatever up and coming religion is moving into your backyard well that depends on where you are and what your neighbors are doing do you draw yourself close to rome keep away from its intrigues or try to dominate them all is the benefit of maintaining a fleet worth the price do you embrace the new heretical learnings or stay away in fear of public outcry when a civil war comes on whose side do you stand can you combine the ideals of being a christian ruler with the demands of medieval politics yes it adapted from an idea i had for a future eu game but i am sure you can adapt it to ck gameplay the questions would become more personal i suppose the principle should be the same ,23,CrusaderKings

MetalRetsam,but he clearly trying to convey something here he has a message a feeling of some kind no matter how fleeting and one of those feelings apparently is that they have not figured that the women are smarter right now than the men i cannot tell what he means by that women are genetically smarter than men perhaps through overhearing that girls are getting better test results something something hillary clinton conspiracies women are devious and shifty they are clever alright it the context that makes me think it the first one the these days comment so it not something about women in general and the comment on the position of women in iranian society he uses it as an example to show that the iranians do not treat their women right in the enlightened western way which makes me think that he genuinely believes women are smarter than men more hawkish or maybe that they have more cunning or something the men therefore have to play dirtier at least that how i think he sees the world it not that there some kind of grand philosophy to be found here but there still plenty to be mined from his stream of consciousness ramblings in the sense that it gives you an idea of the way he thinks he obviously trying to make a point here it not totally incoherent you just have to put yourself in trump shoes ,2,politics

MetalRetsam,gladly the first thing to establish is the year looking at the fashion and manners of the people tells us a lot about the era we are in winifred fervent activism for women suffrage places this before 1918 however there is one line that makes things easy for us in this respect during the song a british bank the life i lead mr banks sings it grand to be an englishman in 1910 because mr banks is a very serious man who would never do something as make up the year we can conclude that it is indeed the year 1910 next up is the season the following line of the song king edward on the throne it the age of men is crucial here the reign of king edward vii lasted from 1901 to 1910 may 6 1910 to be precise we can therefore conclude that it is before may 6th probably somewhere in spring this is corroborated by the blossoms in cherry tree lane as we have previously established mr banks is a serious and socially engaged man at the very heart of the british empire he is therefore a reputable source on the identity of the current monarch the seasons do not lie either that means that it must be sometime in spring 1910 the next thing to establish is the day of the week the final scene of the movie is londoners going out to the park to fly kites including a number of highly reputable bankers from the social norms and bank opening hours common in 1910 it follows that this must be a sunday a sunday in spring 1910 mary poppins takes place over the course of five days the last day is the aforementioned kite flying scene the events of the previous day saturday were mr banks taking his children to the bank the ensuing bank run and mr banks being dishonorably discharged the day before that friday was the tea party on the ceiling with uncle albert and mary poppins suggesting to mr banks that he should take his children to the bank the day before that thursday the street chalk scene with the hunt and supercalifragalisticexpialidocious which ends in rain mary poppins hired herself on that thursday morning after mr banks tore up the advertisement for a nanny the previous evening wednesday after katie nanna quits her job due to the punctuality of mr banks and admiral boom we can date the beginning of the film to wednesday afternoon sometime around 5 30 pm it is the punctuality of these two that helps us solve the final piece in the puzzle in which week does this film take place for this we turn to the saturday after jane and michael run away from the bank run they have caused they run into bert and later into mary poppins as well they lark about london walk over rooftops and behind them we can see the sun go down shortly after bert and the chimney sweeps perform the show stopping number step in time only to be interrupted by admiral boom and mr binnacle setting off their very regular and very punctual 6 o clock salvo that it is indeed 6 is further corroborated by mr banks returning home from his disastrous day at the bank punctual as always what we can deduce from this is during this particular day the sun has set shortly before six step in time takes about eight minutes in movie time the sun sets shortly before and we can also expect admiral boom to take to his roof well ahead of his six o clock salvo in case of any unforeseen circumstances i therefore estimate the time of sunset on that particular saturday to have been anywhere from fifteen to thirty minutes before six the rest is simple astronomy a matter of checking the calendar https www timeanddate com calendar year 1910 country 9 and sunrise sunset tables for london in 1910 this leaves us with two immediate candidates saturday march 5 1910 when sunset occurred at 5 46 pm https www timeanddate com sun uk london month 3 year 1910 and saturday february 26 1910 when sunset occurred at 5 33 pm https www timeanddate com sun uk london month 2 year 1910 of this the latter allows for slightly more time to fit in step in time and adm boom the previous saturday february 19 1910 the sun set at 5 21 pm this is a little too early for my tastes having established by measure of astronomy that this sequences takes place on saturday the 26th of february the rest of the film falls into place around it mary poppins takes place between 5 30 pm on wednesday the 23rd and the morning of sunday the 27th of february 1910 note i believe that the dates for oliver and company can be extrapolated as well through a somewhat simpler method if i remember correctly and i am not sure about that on one of the backgrounds in the film there hangs a calendar that says 14 april 1988 ,80,badhistory

MetalRetsam,by far the greatest power towards the close of the 2nd millennium was the european empire the europeans had much in common with their roman ancestors and commonly saw themselves as their successors the empire was a loose confederation of industrial sub states often in friendly competition against one another it was this competition that gave the europeans a scientific edge and allowed them to conquer and civilize the rest of the world which was still pre modern the european state religion was christian though it had split up into two sects by the time of the diet of worms in 1517 presumably after a period of famine orthodoxy was a major heresy as was muhammadism though there are some stories of jews having lived in europe most historians now understand them to have been a rhetorical fiction that grew into a popular legend or meme civil wars were common in europe as there seemed to be a neverending struggle for internal hegemony one of the earliest known events in the empire history is the revolutionary war which saw france take over the title of emperor from habsburg and led to the breakaway of the america from britain and spain over the next century many lands pretended the title leading to internal friction this came to a head in the great war of 1914 1945 when the hitler tried to take over europe they ultimately failed and europe was partitioned between the america and the rus in 1945 leading to the empire demise although the western and eastern european empires continued to claim the imperial legacy popularly they are more famous as the western and evil empires which are traditionally not considered european over the next 60 years all regions relinquished their imperial pretensions ending with portugal in 1999 there was much talk of a european union in the late 20th and 21st century among local separatists but there is no clear evidence that this was ever more than an idea ,2,badhistory

MetalRetsam,i think there another lesson to be learned from hoi4 and stellaris current gen paradox games have to be huge even on launch to compare to their predecessors their scope is enormous as we all know did not paradox create sengoku and march of the eagles to kind of test out the new engine and the interfaces on a smaller scale sengoku as a kind of ck1 5 and mote as a kind of eu3 5 i do not think that was a bad move in fact i think that one of the reasons why the launch of ck2 and eu4 was smooth compared to gsgs before and after it also pretty nice to have a paradox game for once that is not mind bogglingly huge in fact it might help to draw a more casual audience so i hope that paradox in the event that they throw themselves onto victoria 3 first develop a smaller game with similar mechanics perhaps a cold war game to test out some stuff i think we have the expectation that all the core four should be in some stage of development all the time but i do not feel this way at all i would love the ck series to get a bit of a rest with the odd maintenance patch coming out perhaps so that they can take the time to come up with a proper sequel while new people can come to a complete game and not be scared away by endless dlc coming out besides the games are time consuming enough by themselves i cannot find the time to play two campaigns at once let alone four ,6,paradoxplaza

MetalRetsam,we do not get headlines about crime rates in american cities where i live i am afraid personally i think that it simply being reported on more today than it was in the past which creates a feeling that it going up while it not really still you are right that homicide rates in the us overall are much higher than in other places in the developed world and it never a bad thing to put a stop to that i think the difference is that the left has a different approach to crime in general republicans tend to up the security sometimes past the point where it actually effective imo while the left is more concerned with removing the societal causes for crime ie poverty drug addiction where i am from the preferred method is local social involvement in problem neighborhoods which seems to be pretty effective blm have been pretty quiet lately have not they ,1,AskTrumpSupporters
MetalRetsam,quit being so antagonistic towards me and consider my perspective for a moment my media tells me that murder rates have been going down for the past 15 20 years with national statistics to back it up and everything as far as i know the situation not so bad historically while things may be on the upswing a little it nothing major then you say no that not true america is super duper dangerous and trump reaction is common sense you provide some examples i am trying to engage but i disagree with your methods of finding sources i come from a place of skepticism obviously but if you think that i am trying to argue with you for no reason well you are wrong i just asked for some different sources that all you retort with a thinly veiled ad hominem what did i do to deserve that re reading your earlier post i think i misread your use of the word narrative i thought you were accusing the other poster of being deliberately misinforming in order to push a political agenda you meant narrative in the sense of ideas about the state of the country with no political bias involved have i got that right still it not too much to ask for some quantitative statistical data right if you give me some sources and i do not think you cannot reason off of them is it too much to ask for different sources my reasoning is this there nothing that indicates that those cities are representative for the entire country and i fear that they may not be for whatever reason why did not you show any articles from the national media that would at least put it in something of a bigger context or federal statistics always a great source give me something quantitative you know let me be clear i am not trying to argument anything here i am just skeptical that all that a reasonable position to take for anything if trump wants to fight crime that great it just strange that there one side incl the president that thinks crime rates are exploding and one side that thinks that crime is not so bad it just a statistic a pretty weird thing to be divided on as a country i occupy one side you occupy the other i want to know why i want you to give some statistics that conflict with my own in order to argument your position the president should not have to make a big deal of urban murder rates if they are not is all ,2,AskTrumpSupporters
MetalRetsam,consider the idea that we are not trying to push any narratives this is just the idea we are getting from our own sources i could say that you are deliberately fearmongering with your articles but i do not think that the case so i am not going to i think you have some interesting data but i would like to see some statistics for the whole country after all it hard to judge a country on six cities alone the idea i am getting is that while homicide rates are on the rise currently we have not quite gotten to 80s 90s levels yet ,3,AskTrumpSupporters

MetalRetsam,i see social acts as a kind of credit that you can build up and spend for your own benefit being nice to other people and spreading kindness increases your credit with others when you reach a difficult spot they will be more charitable towards you in return of course this does not work one on one because people are individuals some are just nice others are just assholes so do not expect anything tangible in return but there a general correlation plus a consistent record of openness and kindness builds trust and that is one of the most valuable commodities in the world a reputation for being a good person will go a long way are you ultimately acting in your own interest because you act in other people interest yes but you also act in other people interest by acting in other people interest no man is an island and we are all in this together these days so we better start acting as a collective if we want to have some control over our own destinies ,2,AskReddit

MetalRetsam,i think the main problem i have with hawking statement is that he is so clearly not a historian or a philosopher neither am i but i at least have a background in the humanities rather than the sciences the representation of history is a very complex subject that you cannot simply dismiss out of hand i look at history as a record of all the ways in which people have attempted to organize society and their consequences it a record of human nature and a proud display of all of our shortcomings what i think we can learn from this is how to avoid those shortcomings and mistakes in the future when you look back in hindsight you only notice the differences things that were fixed later from our perspective we forget the incredible amount of craft and skill that went into upholding that society at that time the way people thought back then because those are not generally the kinds of those that are handed down to us and furthermore we do not consider them relevant anymore unless you are a history nerd specialist but they hardly impact society as a whole society does not value them at the same time our own society has its problems and contortions that are the consequences of those changes and fixings so we do not see those either of course your own generation always feels superior to those before after you you can only judge other generations and cultures in how well they would adapt to the world around you hawking is not completely wrong but that partly because social institutions work as a kind of ideal as long as no one makes any mistakes ever they serve their purpose but since society is such a fragile demanding thing and people fail to fulfill its expectations all the time everything constantly goes wrong the course of history for the most part is a kind of knee jerk correction to the most glaring faults of its day because real creativity is hard until people came up with the idea that it might be better to think over how everything fits together and how we would like everything to fit together and then base our institutions off of that this is where the enlightenment steps in the problem is that so much what followed in the next 200 years was widely off mark you wo not believe how much of the humanities starts with we started thinking about this in the 19th century but we were actually widely off in some fundamental aspects and it led to some pretty terrible things those times that people thought they knew everything about society and tried to remodel it ended up in failure fascism communism nazism we have decided to just sort of leave it alone since then see the humanities and the social sciences are hard despite knowing so much about where we come from and so on we are still really bad at making sure people do not do stupid shit on a massive scale in fact we are so bad at it that in trying to do so we inadvertently do stupid shit on a massive scale why because of science somewhere in the 19th century science just completely surpassed the humanities and we have been wondering what to do with all this scientific knowledge most we have just been using it for those knee jerk patch ups although it has on occasion led to some massive dead ends phrenology if we had half as much of an accurate picture of humanity as the scientists have we could really get somewhere instead people make do with really specific and specialist knowledge of humanity and it getting really hard to find enough people to see life through the same paradigm conservatism liberalism libertarianism confessionalism marxism postmodernism feminism post colonialism etc which is necessary because democracy everyone has pieces of the puzzle but nobody knows how they fit together and there goes overprivileged science fanning the flames giving them new things to debate about while the old subjects are still hot new knowledge to use in all the wrong ways and worst of all that false sense of certainty that blinds people from other viewpoints because they are educated and science is backing them up all of these things they then proceed to apply in their typical knee jerk way because they got issues this is where mr hawking perspective is limited no scientific discovery no matter how miraculous is going to solve mankind problems unless mankind figures out how to use it responsibly and given the historical record on this sort of thing i am not betting my money on it philosophy may be massively flawed as a science it is pretty much the one unifying place where people can come together and talk this sort of thing over it where human thought got its start history may be massively flawed as well but it the closest thing the humanities have to a laboratory there a lot of failed experiments in any laboratory but you never hear anybody talk about those in history they comprise the vast majority of our data so we kind of have to work with them we have a lot of minor successes just like you guys it just that we cannot have any isolated ones there always some kind of failure related to them we are working on it post modernist thought has only been around for so long we still have not been able to work through the backlog of human thought and achievement and adjusted everything according to its implications heck we are barely figuring out all of the implications tl dr hawking your privilege is showing come
