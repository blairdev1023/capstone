Shuizid,well in legal terms she totally does have the right to do that you might need an argument on why she should not do what is her right which basically means finding something that she likes which that reaction is hurting like you feelings though it is totally possible that she just likes to be angry and therefore wo not actually care about a lot of argument against it after all she is allowed to do it and if there is no actual damage done by it i personally would not know how to convince her otherwise ,1,LifeProTips
Shuizid,yeah this is wrong controlling your reactions needs mental capability and that one is not infinite ofcourse while beeing calm and full of energy it is simple to think before acting but when stressed out or after a lot of work one does simply not have left enough energy to think and just reacts the most basic way which might be different from person to person in fact you can train this ability like pretty much everything else as this ability is just impulse control ,1,LifeProTips
Shuizid,the 2 of them are merging together at the end neither ozpin nor oscar will remain but something new first indicator is that oscar can access the memory of ozpin which means the memory of the two becomes the new memory of the new emerging beeing second and more important indicator is that ozpin tried to convince oscar to certain actions and ozpin even said he choose oscar for his will to explore the world or something so ozpin choose oscar for having a fitting personality fitting for what well let call him ozcar the fusion out of ozpin and oscar i think of it a bit like the fusions in steven universe ozpin did not randomly choose someone but someone who has a personality that fits the role of what will become ozcar in that process both original personalities will sort of disappear ofcourse looking at the tale maybe there will be some kind of mental fight of who is more important or something like that though the fact ozpin did choose oscar for his personality and not his general location could have just choosen someone in the capitol of haven does not seem like ozpin will simply take over the body ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,makes the most sense so it must be true ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,you know there is no point for me to argue a lot as i do not know anything for certain either just the cinder part is quite interesting i have heard that it might have been her bow which at the time of the even she was holding in her left hand the hand which right now is either severly burnt or actually missing and ofcourse her left eye is damaged technically any weird movement of her clothing could also be due to flawed animation so maybe she still has her arm wo not make a difference ofcourse as a burnt arm is as useless as a lost one ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,what am i supposed to see in that chapter let get the first thing out of the way ruby as a character follows common mc tropes though ofcourse this can have a canon reason like the silver eyes i just do not see any indication of that beeing the case sew are the best warriors no doubt i just do not see why there needs to be a special sew combat stage acting different in a combat situation seems quite normal to me mostly becouse this is the common trope of those shounen mc and ofcourse acting serious in a serious situation and less serious in a less serious situation does not need any special ability this is totally normal apart from that ruby has barely shown any strong fighting abilities up until the end of season 3 pyrrha was the strongest warrior and we have not seen ruby do a lot of exceptional fighting ever she got beaten by mercury with her weapon and did not put up a lot of resistance against roman when she was without it this makes it pretty hard for me to believe that there are different stages at all we also know very little of what happened during the finale of volume 3 so there was white light that froze the grimm and did hurt cinder we do not know how that happened just that the grimm got hurt becouse grimm and cinder becouse maiden ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,i do not get it 1 and 3 are mostly just the exact things we have seen in the show apart from the whole sleepwalking which opens up the question where you got that idea from the rest really just describes the things we already know meanwhile i do not see why combat even has to be connected to the silver eyes rwby is inspired by shounen anime and there pretty much every protagonist is a joking dork outside of combat and gets dead serious in combat examples just at the top of my head naruto son goku monkey d luffy saitama so on that note ruby is not special ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,atlas is not just about dust but about dust based technology think about it that way africa has a lot of resources but no technology does it look like africa is going to rule the world no therefore even if salem manages to sell dust cheaper than atlas does atlas would just buy the dust and use it to further increase their wealth with technology salem on the other hand has no technology at all also salem cannot take over remnant by selling dust becouse atlas is selling dust and obviously not controlling remnant therefore even if salem manages to beat atlas she would at best have the same power atlas has now though ofcourse salem cannot defeat atlas with that plan sure she might sell cheap dust but atlas has superior technology that uses dust sure atlas would need to start selling technology rather than pure dust but this should not be problem plus atlas can propably still win against salem simply becouse the atlas technology inculdes technology to create pure high quality dust salem cannot do that either ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,looking at all the people who think pyrrha will come back better be sure ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,well it is like dunno a serial killer stopping a genocide surely the killer is not overall good just becouse he did one good thing ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,if you want a troll to get bored do not reply ,3,LifeProTips
Shuizid,or he protects and cares for ruby becouse he has known tai and summer since school and ruby is the half sister of qrows niece and tai dislikes qrow for beeing an emotional unstable drunk who sometimes comes across as pretty immature or becouse he is jealous as ruby and yang seem pretty chill around qrow hanging out with him and playing games while we do not really see tai do anything with the girls up until the training session ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,salem literally said cinder did everything right and defended her against watts she also did not so much patronize her but push her to her limits she wanted cinder to speak when asked rather than using emerald she pushes her to overcome her weakness and whatever is holding her back salem is not doing it like a loving mother ofcourse she is quite strict and seems less warm but she is completely supporting cinder at the end of v4 she uses her flamethrower which pretty much indicates she is ready to fight again it is just as salem said cinder did not fail in any way it was somehow the maidens power which limited her when facing ruby ,7,RWBY
Shuizid,i what just o o,2,RWBY
Shuizid,so you are whining and bitching about others whining and bitching cool have you considered ignoring stuff that annoys you newsflash if you make a provocating joke chances are people will reply and in the end you will waste a lot of time you cannot chill out meanwhile you now admit that joke was meant to silence me because without knowing anything of me you just assume i am immune to arguments and logic and you must keep me out of a serious discussion because you do not care about the topic well that is beyond stupid on several levels if you do not care about it then shut up and ignore it but no you need to make a snarky comment because you do not like thinking about sexism and certainly not about how people might react to your actions those stupid jokes are one of the reasons there are logic immune feminazis you pretty much insult me and do not bring forth a single argument but whine about how feminists do not care about your oppinion on the topic well yeah this is clearly your fault guess you are not so much into arguments or logic yourself ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,as i am not your friend making fun of me is different though i surely should try to be reasonable look i do not really care about that joke because i do not take it personally i just wanted to point out that others might do not be as level headed and that such a behavior might be one of the reasons for actual feminazis making fun of people and potentially hurting their feelings will almost never change their believes but simply make them turn away from such interactions you build your bubble they build theirs i know both sides make mistakes and both try to do what seems reasonable for them but i hope you get my point and i can stop wasting both our time ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,only vacuo looks like a female for the great war but i have to admit i did not thought about those so at least there was an important female though we have not seen any up to this point ozpin and his folks are the protectors of remnant they are protecting the world from a threat nobody besides them knows it even exists ozpin is some sort of immortal and one who worked on building the academys so he is propably the one who issued the protection and saftey of the relics i do not recall summer beeing a rolemodel for ruby as far as i remember her rolemodels were the heros in the books as said by yang when they were in mountain glenn and looking at ruby her style is focused around qrow to the point people consider him beeing her father meanwhile we know next to nothing about summer rose and her relation to ruby well yang once said ruby was to young to really understand what happened does not sound like summer could have been much of a rolemodel either i did make some brought strokes with my comment no doubt and thanks for clearing the situations up a bit but i cannot deny that the story is about girls dealing with a world that is mostly controlled by men while there is no actual gendered issue nobody seems to be opressed or mistreated due to their gender it just came to my attention this is not necessarily bad though it opened up a new meta perspective on the show ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,thanks i am glad some people get my point ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,so you admit the numbers are skewed but you somehow do not think my intent might be good that is kinda weird we do have male leaders of pretty much everything to this point and while they are flawed they still are the one place to look for advice nobody asked glynda on how to deal with salem and winter was there to tell weiss about summoning then disappeared again the females do not have political power and so far they barely influenced the story i am not just looking at numbers but at relevance and glynda winter and raven have not done anything important so far the best thing was raven saving yang which is nice but the scene of yang getting defeated was overall pointless did not change anything casting woman as fallible characters is not bad it is normal and apparently having less woman in important positions is ok for everyone as it is just as in real life yet somehow also showing failing woman out of real life is bad why who would say that except complete idiots and why care about them the maincharacters are females who fail and grow steven universe has a lot of failing and growing females and that show is not hated for that in the least also if crwby did not want people to complain about demonizing woman they did a bad job the big bad is female we have cinder who was the antagonist for the first seasons then there is raven who would have let her own daughter die the good ones however are glynda winter and kali who did do pretty much nothing at all ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,i will also have a hard time finding a girl named weiss or winter ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,making fun of someone is an attack on them an insult so why do you insult me for asking a simple question and what do you think this does to people who are not as cold as me what do you think would happen with people who are more sensible what with people who are more aggressive this is not just a dumb joke you want it to be one so you do not have to think about the consequences ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,so you are admitting you try to silence me good now can you give me reason on why silencing people is good what is the benefit of silencing a nazi a communist me how would you feel if people try to silence you becouse of whatever reason ,-2,RWBY
Shuizid, wor is the past yeah more males in the past is realistic it happened irl it sucks sure but that how history was just wondering if this is the reason and if so why did they design it with real history in mind did they just copy real history without thinking about it or is there another reason and what could that be it would actually because having too many male leaders is your arguing point swap some of the male leaders with females and there no more exism not that there any anyways but and your problem is solved it might seem like that becouse i did not put enough thought into the opening post but my actual question is apart from the meta is there sexism in remnant which i actually do not care why is the wor dominated by males and rwby by females ,0,RWBY
Shuizid,actually i think that figuring that out might help me understand how people are thinking and this inculdes myself becouse as written at the end up there i am doing a pretty similar thing in stories i am working on also i am wondering if the characters are interesting regardless of their gender or becouse of it would the show be the same if we switch around the genders but nothing else not a single behavior so it is in part the question if my enjoyment of the show is due to sexist views of myself ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,guess you got triggered by the s word do not worry it happens though could you next time try to add not writing to the not reading part thanks ,5,RWBY
Shuizid,how exactly is trying to silence a different view a joke if i am wrong then go on and prove me wrong if you cannot maybe you are wrong and this joke is just a way of trying to avoid a discussion you would loose xd,0,RWBY
Shuizid,just looked at the wiki sienna khan is based on shere khan from the jungle book and the gender of sienna seems to not be mentioned yet ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,people not caring does not mean there is not issue people did not care to look if the earth was flat or not i am looking to determine how it is ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,and if you would not rant about the lack of incompetent females but care to look and analyze the show like i tried in this topic we could have an interesting discussion same goes if there would only be powerfull females and no males do you really think nobody would bother heck i am sure i would and there are enough males who would as well while shunning it for some feminazi crap also i made a difference between the wor and rwby the one is the setting of the other and i am just wondering why the one is controlled by males and the other by females so having the current people dethroned or introducing new characters would not change a lot but let focus on the important fact why are there so little incompetent woman ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,cinder was not a female in training she is part of the salem party and propably coudl not defeat ozpin without the maidens power ok while never actually shown in any way i buy salem beeing powerfull we can also assume raven is extremely powerfull this is nice but we sill end up with a world in which almost all the political power is in the hands of males ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,the thing i noticed is there are no woman in power at all it is not so much about showing failing woman but about showing important woman heck you could remove pretty much every single woman apart from the maincast from the series and it would not change anything ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,never said the show would be bad gosh do you folks get triggered so easily by someone talking about females you really need to chillax more xd,1,RWBY
Shuizid,thanks for that i should have invested more time into that potato xd though the thing is i kinda looked at rwby and the wor differently you know rwby has more important females than males the wor however which is the world rwby takes place in has more males pretty much all of them are supporting characters with minor roles in rwby it just got me wondering why is that ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,ozpin was not lifting a finger and nobody cares that he turned out weaker than a maiden ironwood surely is not the boss of winter just becouse he is stronger so strength does not seem to be the only source of authority and control ,-1,RWBY
Shuizid,raven is strong but she wields no political power same goes for salem khan gender seems to actually be unknown but the character is based on khan of the jungle book meanwhile all important political positions are in the hands of men beacon ozpin atlas ironwood haven lionheart menagerie ghira sdc jaque there might be a femal in vacuo assuming khan is female that means the wf who might still be terrorists salem who also leads kind of terrorists and raven who leads a band of bandits and does not care a lot about the world this is not a display of political power ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,we have never seen salem do anything even remotely close to fighting so why do you assume she could beat anyone ,-1,RWBY
Shuizid,if men can fail why cannot woman i do not see a problem in showing woman failing with power while showing men who do the exact same thing ,4,RWBY
Shuizid,i am looking at everything through a gendered lense and i have no problem having fun so maybe you should chillax a bit and not be afraid of a gendered lense ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,who is professor peach glad there is another female teacher though this does not change a lot and i meant the world of remnant not the history lessons the world where rwby is taking place in and so far this world is almost entirely controlled by men both in politics and in strength ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,yeah they are all in training and they surely would loose against all the strong male characters ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,oh ok thanks i dind t know that ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,i am not talking about equal i am talking about any like there is not a single female with political power except the new lead of the whitefang as i just learned ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,yang said ruby was to young when summer died to fully grasp what happened and looking at v4 jaune was way more mature in dealing with the world and he was the only one who dealt with pyrrhas death he kept training in her honor and added her stuff to his shield and sword growing with her death meanwhile ruby is still the happy go lucky kiddo that just assumes everything will go well apart from her final letter she did not mention loss at all and she lost 2 friends and ran away from home ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,rwby might be worth it but this game not ,5,RWBY
Shuizid,i remember the first appearence of ren and nora she was talking like crazy and he made like one comment what happened to that hyper energetic nora damn you crwby ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,handsome jack from borderlands i want to see him take over atlas and create a diamant horse with an aura ,5,RWBY
Shuizid,considering there are only 4 academys in the entire wor and they are quite small compared to actual academys in our world it is not unusual to barely see any actual huntsmen and contacting them might also be an issue most of them will be working somewhere and not exactly waiting for an invite to protect beacon on a moments notice they are not like police large numbers easy to adress and relocate but like a big bunch of independent people running around and doing jobs for hire ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,penny does have an aura and as an aura is ones manifestation of the soul she does have a soul ,1,RWBY
Shuizid, zwei means two not second so zwei is not the second god but two god s he is both gods this would explain where they went after the creation humanity they just turned into a cute immortal doggy ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,he also arrived seperated from his friends at beacon and he gave a reason why neptun did not join now and nobody cares for the rest of sssn so him following blake is not that weird to begin with he had nothing to do and bringing down the white fang seemed like the best option he had at the time though he did skip school but at least on the telling side he is more interested in bringing down the wf than he is in blake she is a good friend and he has no idea how to do it anyway so he is helping her as well but looking at how he interrupted the bonding moment between blake and her father he did not really care what blake wanted in that situation ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,she is definitely gunsexual ,4,RWBY
Shuizid,do not recall a scene where he fawned blake though this just means i propably forgot the thing is blake arc does not currently revolve around a relationship but around fighting instead of running there might be something with sun on the horizon but it wo not happen soon the interaction with her parents are fun sure but those work perfectly fine without any relationship and as the show will focus more on the serious aspect of taking over the white fang i do not know if they even have time to develope anything storywise ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,my cards are on whiteknight jaune and weiss because reasons the reason beeing i do not see any other ship coming only becouse characters spend time together does not mean they will be a ship neither lancaster nor blacksun have shown a lot of emotional interactions in any meaningfull way renora were always close friends and i still absolutely love their interaction in their very first episode showing how close they were pyrrha interest in jaune was also pretty obvious from very early on so far we did not get anything even remotely close to that hence i do not see any ship coming ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,you know people tend to die when they confess their love so just for the trope i would assume renora though actually i think jaune will die and be reborn as the new roman and together with neo he will replace ruby as mc ride kevin to salem and have a serious talk about proper hospitality did you see her serve any actual food in her hideout ,4,RWBY
Shuizid,aw man i hate when there are birthday parties in the middle of a blizzard it would be really nice having a couple of men helping out there ,4,RWBY
Shuizid,so is jaune turning into the new roman ,1,RWBY
Shuizid, i do not know qrow this thing is really heavy i i do not even know how to accurately point at anything with this why even make such a scythe when it is only used to shoot i i mean qrow this sounds really dangerous like why not just use a regular gun qrow a and why do i have to shoot with it this thing is really heavy and ahm i eh i do not even know how this rick looks like ,8,RWBY
Shuizid,wait was not the aura of qrow grey ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,i am retty sure they had no money ren and nora are orphans and there is a good chance they are broke as hell we do not know about jaunes finances but surely he does not have much to spare either this leaves is with ruby who maybe just did not bother taking much money with her as she assumed the journey will be rather short i mean yang has a bike but maybe she worked for it herself as she is 2 years older so ruby might not have a lot of money herself or invested it into completely into crescent rose ,3,RWBY
Shuizid, oh jeez qrow i i do not know if i can do this take this rick out with this scythe that is also a gun qrow i think this would be murder i do not think i can murder someone qrow do i really have to do this i do not even know how to use this thing why cannot you do it you know how this scythe is handled ,12,RWBY
Shuizid, oh boy rick really a gun that sounds dangerous what am i supposed to do with it rick why did you give me a scythe that is also a gun ,23,RWBY
Shuizid,dunno guess she is pretty occupied back in vale no reason for her to get to haven same as the other teachers and tai ,16,RWBY
Shuizid,on science like this one http www iflscience com technology four easy tips make your batteries last longer you can also just google for lithium ion batteries ,1,LifeProTips
Shuizid,modern batteries in laptops as well as smartphones are quite different from the old ones with charge memory their perfect charge is 50 while very high and low charges are extremely stressfull for it reducing it lifespan apart from only charging them up to 70 80 also start charging them at around 20 30 ,1,LifeProTips
Shuizid,but as we know ozpin is lying half the time so maybe the 2 brothers were actually conjoined twins and ozpin stole their favourite coffe mug ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,in the same chapter qrow told the gods left earth so salem and ozpin cannot be those gods ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,that death would be rather anti climactic mostly brings forth the question how aura works out of combat can people with aura get hurt on a day to day basis surely makes cutting vegetable easier if you cannot cut yourself or insta heal xd,1,RWBY
Shuizid,while i will start working on a fanfic where the two would come together in the actual show they most certainly wo not they have a better basis to become friends now that jaune became a more serious person and got over her they surely will interact at some point and maybe weiss will be surprised he is no longer hitting on her though i would assume this already happened in v3 if they interact we should see a significant chance after all they never really interacted in any other way but jaune hitting on her ,8,RWBY
Shuizid,kinda sounds like making sense though i do not think that is tha case qrow and summer where long out of school when she died and so i do not know why they should be working together on a level that get her killed she was a mother of 2 at that point and qrow most certainly already a spy for ozpin so why would they even work together i mean she certainly was good i assume but at this time qrows semblance should not be a secret to his closest friends and therefore i cannot imagine someone would risk sending him on a mission together with summer ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,yep a shield or maybe even something like a thorn shield hurting others when as well as pretecting him ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,son goku monkey d ruffy naruto all the superheroes john wick neo sorry which powerfull characters do not make good mc lor is not the best example either yeah frodo does not have raw power but he is the only one who for whatever reason has the power to destroy the one ring sounds pretty powerfull to me and if someone wants to say ruby is not the most important character who else would it be oscar has done nothing so far ozpin also only seemed like knowing where the dice will fall and running with it the most proactive action he was doing so far was choosing pyrrha as maiden everything else he did to this point did not even seem to bother salem and wtch i mean yeah he build the schools and hid the relics but that is history not the story ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,she stopped cinder a giant grimm dragon and cut off tyrians tail while helping qrow fighting i do not know what you expect from a mc but so far she dealt the most damage to salem of all the characters we see except ozpin managing to hide the relic everything but ruby went exactly as planned by salem and wtch ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,the fact that nobody treats her differently seems like a plothole as she even tells jaune this is the thing she liked about him yet we never actually see someone bothering her with it except weiss the first episodes where overall pretty stupid with the story the way the teams were assembled was completely random and most likely an easy way to create the teams the creators wanted without bothering with details if there would be a major change we cannot ignore how it would actually feel for people to be put into such a weird situation ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,you do not understand it becouse it has nothing to do with eachother though many people seem to declare fanart as fair use this is simply wrong fair use applies to criticism and report meaning if people talk about the object in a bigger context but do not alter the original however in court it is important how much money the content owner lost by the fanart and often this number is to small so bigger companies usually do not bother with it if there is a multi million dollar franchise they do not bother about people selling prints worth a couple thousands a year especially as there are propably thousands of people doing this and this is simply not worth the effort apart from that fanart is free advertising it helps build a community which cares for the original content and therefore creates more sales for originales as well so another reason to sue fanart would be if it threatens to challenge the popularity of the original however this means fanart is always illegal but unless the content owner sues the fanart creator nothing will happen and more often than not the owner does not care for various reasons this does not mean it is legal it just makes it a crime that usually is not prosecuted ,2,fanart
Shuizid,you mean 3 she would have enormous guilt complex becouse she might have been able to save jaune 4 she might get depressed becouse she pretty much lost the only person who treated her like a normal person although technically the entire main cast excluding weiss never treated pyrrha like a hero 5 you really jump fast to the conclusion that nobody will care about a dead student 6 the entire school might riot becouse the very first test killed someone and was extremely dangerous apart from the landing they did fight 2 giant grimm and they go to a school where they are supposed to learn fighting not be masters of it 7a either cinder has an easy deal as the school already is rather defenseless thanks to the riot or 7b pyrrha is less of a threat even as maiden as she still is emotionally troubled thanks to the loss of the one guy she kinda had a crush on from the very start ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,well they do have quite the reach apart from rt yang had an appearence in a death battle with milions of views so that surely helped also looking at a friend of mine pretty much every single character of rwby is unique distinct and lovable up to the point even the throw away roman and his short appearing sidekick neo get a ton of love to the point roman had to be included in later episodes and neo seems to come back in the future as well the characters are all distinct and the mere fact everyone has a unique weapon and often even a semblance simply makes them all likeable plus it might help that pretty much all of them are based on more or less well known characters in one way or another it might also profit from the fact it is free on youtube and in english no illegal streaming and fanmade subtitles and ofcourse there are the target audience tropes we have a lot of attractive girls who kick ass and maybe chew bubblegum while wielding a wide array of amazing weapons ,5,RWBY
Shuizid,it a trap ,8,RWBY
Shuizid,i sincerely doubt white rose ofcourse they could always pull the korra twist but it would be a major surprise if ruby enters a relaionship at all let alone a gay one while i can imagine jaune needing some closure on pyrrha i still do not see a big problem in there the 2 were not even a couple and they had one rather onesided kiss though i have learned they had some mutual feelings it always sounds like they were married for 20 years and had 2 children and jaune now has to sort out his entire life after her death so he had no closure on screen and therefore we can conclude he had none 6 months in the woods with his closest friends would be enough but not playing out that emotional event would be bad screenwriting so it might happen in the future but i still have my issues making a big deal out of it becouse their relationship has not even started ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,i do think she did pretty much explain her point of view she left tai and yang becouse her tribe needed her and her tribe is above all you are right maybe she would have wanted tai to follow but it is also possible she did not want him to do so however she valued yang as a part of the tribe becouse she is her daughter so she saved her once as it is the rule or something but that it it is said several times that raven has a different idea of family and using that view her actions are pretty straight forward the tribe needs her she goes to it one tribe member is in mortal danger she saves them once yang seeing as she does not seem to have any interest in qrow apart from information he seems to not be considered as part of the tribe anymore and who is not part of the tribe ozpin as well does not bother her much ,8,RWBY
Shuizid,well i cannot move through the years without going completely out of canon xd guess i will see what i do when i have more time to work on it ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,and during the geist jaune is said to be the tactician who does not need a weapon so it is still canon that jaune is not a good fighter apart from the fact that they might have done a couple of jobs and fight some grimm but overall they must have spent most of their time just walking we do not know in which state beacon is or how glynda would even think of repairing it considering there is a giant frozen grimm dragon right in the middle of it that is said to attract more grimm but regardless as long as cardin is training in any way logic says he is stronger than jaune but ofcourse the show might see that differently ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,uhh thanks a lot that is really interesting and well thought out though now that i think about starting a fanfic i cannot provide several volumes of story for a show i am not involved in duh but i will keep that in mind and considering i try not to go off canon to much keeping it in mind will propably mean i cannot actually ship those 2 in a short fanfic so yeah i absolutely get your point and am really glad you took the time to explain it to that length ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,really damnit well that certainly makes things more difficult like need to edit the text i was writing the last 2 hours difficult but i can do this for jaune for the ship for the white knight and also becouse heck why not ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,it was a dick move meanwhile jaune is dancing in a dress to keep a promise so it is not hard to figure out which of those 2 is the better person ,6,RWBY
Shuizid,well i will surely make a topic about it when i am at it ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,i am not to much into tumblr but this seems like the shit i could use to skyrocket my presence into well into the the hell of boundless hatred as it seems now i am hyped to do something but my schedule does not allow me to do much for at least another month ,1,RWBY
Shuizid, legacy might have been the wrong word i cannot think of something more fitting right now this whole if hed been better is an extremely toxic thinking something only one would do who does not know how to cope with bad things who cannot let go of the past and look into the future jaune does not have the strength and up to this point does not seem to ever develope the strength heck you are saying he needs to get stronger than ozpin than a maiden who has magic powers this would just be insane and jaune did not look insane to me he is not watching the video he is training he did not just add some nice ornaments to his shield he improved it this is what i mean with legacy he is not just looking at her tiara and crying he is also not walking around and doing his best to not think about her he has moved on he has used pyrrhas remains to become a better person not to become a sociopath who develops a guilt complex becouse he does not have unheard superpowers and he does not need a therapist just someone uttering the words pyrrha wanted you to be happy even if it meant for her to be unhappy so be happy or i will break your legs if only i could think of someone to say that ,0,RWBY
Shuizid,1 just to refresh my memory apologize for what exactly 2 a significant number of volumes like 3 or more sounds like an awfull lot why so much ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,who cares what they are planning i am starting my fanfic now xd,3,RWBY
Shuizid,lancester dunno did the two of them had any chemistry at all i might have missed it but i did not notice anything shipworthy this volume ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,jaune is honoring pyrrhas legacy as a close friend taking on her remains and watching the video to become a better fighter however he did not do a failure he did not know what was coming but he did his best to protect her and what she did was her decision he could have a guilt arc where he has to learn that sometimes bad things just happen but we kinda went through that and we see jaune as someone who can deal with bad feelings letting his whole life revolve around dead pyrrha would not be healthy a life only dedicated to revenge yeah that does not fit jaune and i am pretty sure every single character around him would tell him that too and ffs yeah it was his first kiss so what i know in anime this is like the most important thing in the world but i do not buy it becouse in the real world it is not and not only are 6 months enough to get over someone as jaune was not into pyrrha at the time there is nothing to get over in the first place apart from that jaune so far is not the character who seems able to be hellbend on revenge all in all i do not buy jaune beeing such a oneminded hatefilled brick ,0,RWBY
Shuizid,the difference is jaune is walking most of the time and not even fighting grimm thanks to qrow while cardin is at beacon receiving training and killing the grimm who get attracted to the giant dragon ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,oh right beeing social and also training with actual people while jaune trained alone with no opponent endurance is nice but walking is not an effective training at all an effective training involves putting as much stress on the muscles as possible that is something rnjr could not do becouse they are not in a safe environment hence they cannot risk beeing exhausted by hard training cardin simply has the upper hand when it comes to training ofcourse we have to assume he also kept training but considering he wanted to become a huntsmen i do not think that is a problem ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,not really with his pushy trumpet they cannot stand in front of him anyway so the weapon would not change that but it would give him some actual fighting capability rather than beeing almost completely useless ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,yeah neptune fears water cannot dance and is more likely to dump a nice girl than to admit he is not as cool as everyone thinks ,6,RWBY
Shuizid,really interesting well guess i now know what to put into my weiss fanart that will happen somewhere in the not to close future xd,5,RWBY
Shuizid,sure he might not just run into weiss and start dating her but he also should not be stuck in the past pyrrha is gone and wo not come back and she wanted him to be happy so it would be in interest of her memory if he did not let his grief stop his advance on weiss ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,during the dance jaune helped neptune and weiss pretty much the same way pyrrha helped jaune towards weiss before yet pyrrha still had feelings for jaune so why should not jaune still have feelings for weiss throw in nora and a pyrrha would have wanted you to be happy even if it meant giving you up and we resolve that ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,jaune never had a romance with pyrrha she was into him but he always was into weiss so this would not be another romance it would be just a continuation of what he felt all the time unless we assume he instantly fell in love with pyrrha after she gave him one kiss and developed a deep emotional bond to her within the 3 seconds before she stuffed hin into a locker and rocketed him outta there so she can die alone it is tragic yeah but jaune was head over heels or however it is spelled for weiss not for pyrrha ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,uh thanks that might be usefull for the future ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,considering the 6 months of training consisted mostly of walking around i would say not super stronger i mean yeah he started training propably every evening so he surely got stronger but assuming cardin is training as well the mere fact rnjr is walking most of the time and not training in any way will mean jaune is most likely even weaker compared to cardin than back in their school days meanwhile the strongest is well as nora is generaly strong due to her semblance she is the strongest on an everday basis however with a fed semblance yang has a bigger peak strength so yang would win against nora and well rwby is stronger than jnr apart from the 4v3 ren and jaune simply do not bring a lot of strength into the fight both physically as well as with their semblance jaune still missing his entirely meanwhile everyone in rwby has a semblance usefull to fight humans and grimm alike ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,so he needs a short to mid range spray and pray weapon shoot one burst from 4 clones the spray allows them to hit and makes dodging harder ofcourse if this does not knock out the opponent it is 1v1 but with a propably weakened opponent but better than his ability to just push people around a bit ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,they could attack all the same target at the same time so if his trumpet at least also was a gun this would have been enough ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,yeah but weiss has 4 or 5 chambers while raven has like 30 or so ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,propably write a comment under the video and ask there ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,sounds reasonable i assume lionheart does not know watts is after the relic maybe he does not even know about watts working for salem maybe watts offered help against the white fang would be weird if ozpin did not manage to find trusworthy people to run the schools and protect the most powerfull objects of the world maybe a bit cowardly but not so stupid they would give up the relics without resistance ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,nora hey jaune nice room and such but ren and i must quickly go somewhere else jaune wait guys where are you going nora some where and you know do not follow us or i will break your legs jaune oh i like my legs well ok i will sit here and think about how lonely i am nora good boy ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,i am pretty sure raven sword is completely op seems like it can infuse the blade with an array of different dust combinations which most likely will have devastating effects in case she ever uses that thing most underwhelming must be the trumpets i mean heck flynt had a semblance to turn himself into 4 dudes and what happened well he managed to push weiss away a bit cool honestly it seems like this did not even do any damage he basically turned a 1v1 into a 4v1 with his semblance and could not win thanks to that piece of garbage he calls a weapon i doubt you can get any worse than having a weapon that looses a 4v1 ,6,RWBY
Shuizid,people dieing in anime is not exactly a rare thing and got can kill of characters as it has a massive rooster of people who are not needed for the story to progress which makes a vast difference to rwby they simply could not kill off qrow as he was the only one giving rnjr a direction to go without him they would not know what to do once in haven looking into the future there is a good chance nobody is going to die soon they just do not have characters to spare maybe some extras or characters we have not seen the entire volume which kinda makes them extras but those would lack any impact as they got barely any character developement to make us attached to them and as rwby is still not back together there will be hardly time to make us invested into other characters to effectively kill off ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,qrow hey kiddos this is the new ozpin now if you excuse me i am at the bar i was not drinking for almost an entire day so there is a lot of catching up to do ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,that is his problem not op though maybe he knows a place where he can use a computer or has a friend with whom he can share and if he cannot do anything this might help him realize it without damaging the friendship or spread some bad rumors or whatever ,1,GetMotivated
Shuizid,what you need is either the thick skin to pretty much throw him out of the business and pay him something for the somewhat 20 he has done so far this however can surely hurt your friendship and might include other trouble as well so this wo not be without stress or you somehow make him think about how little he has actually done one way to do this is by asking him to make some sort of businessplan in which he writes down what has to be done what already is done who does what and who did what make him rate both your work and his the first one is more effective ofcourse do it and it is done the second one however is the friendlier one and uses the fact that people tend to give rather fitting estimations on how good they worked on something some schools use such techniques for students and it seems to work out rather well the benefit is giving him the responsibility rather than just doing everything on your own if you just throw him out he might reuse his excuses and justify whatever mean behavior as it was your fault not including him and doing everything on your own however with the list he has to judge his own lack of contribution and might end up looking for ways to pull his weight so far he is only saying why he cannot do whatever give him a chance to figure out what he can do maybe he finds some ways and if not he hopefully can see that he is not contributing 50 ,2,GetMotivated
Shuizid,no evidence and does not make sense ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,that is an awfully long text which contains pretty much nothing your evidence are frankly nothing at all 1 pyrrha was killed in the most now be dead for good way possible incinerated not just broken but completely evaporated so how could she even come back penny can be rebuild though her aura is lost so it will be a copy at best but there is no trace of pyrrha no body and surely no soul so this is not an evidence for her coming back at best it was foreshadowing her death 2 so pyrrhas death was used to aid the story coming back would undermine the impact of her death so this is an evidence for her not coming back 3 what list are you talking about also the mere existence of a list with unknown content is not an evidence 4 well that is just pyrrhas personality in rwby chibi as it is a spinoff series this is no evidence for anything roman also was in rwby chibi and so was unharmed cinder and both had chibi would personalities as well that is just how this works ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,according to salems position that would mean tyrian managed to get around half the entire globe in like 1 or 2 days ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,yes yes we do we also ignore her sneak path went right past the office of her daddy ,56,RWBY
Shuizid,oh my bad with the quote sorry for misunderstanding your intention tried the search and really found something thanks for that just wondering is this actual canon ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,wait this means crap they will run out of cookies soon damn you tyrian how are they supposed to survive without cookies you monster ,12,RWBY
Shuizid,that statement merely describes what it actually means to be a huntress a job description and the motivation to take that job are 2 seperate things and therefore this statement does not contradict her motivation there is a manga where why did not i know about this gimme gimme gimme o o,1,RWBY
Shuizid,so salem will win becouse currently weiss is in no position of building a legacy at all well what a bummer and why is the knowledge of the salem the thing ruby needs especially as weiss and propably blake do know a lot more stuff than ruby who did not even know how long it takes to walk around half the globe so ruby kinda fails at knowledge as well blake destroying the white fang and yang choosing to becoming a huntress again also seems kinda arbitrary and ofcourse we could think of other instances but this all seems completely arbitrary ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,what do you mean with better weiss wants to become a huntress to make up for the flaws of her father she wants to help people too i think the same goes for blake blake was always trying to help people yet her group turned into violent terrorists and nothing against nora i love nora but i do not see how the motive of helping people becomes better if one of those people is next to you ,11,RWBY
Shuizid,this explains everything 1 or maybe summer is ruby i mean we have never seen them together and we only have yang word they are 2 seperate beeings and can we really trust yang with that ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,according to her song boop means i love you and she uses it becouse she is frightened of actually revealing her feelings to ren i assume ,14,RWBY
Shuizid,now that is a potato i can get behind although are we sure tai is not the mother ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,yeah the 2 gods left earth regardless of whatever the exact reason might have been they left and coming back to revive one random person who happened to be angry at something undermines whatever reason they might have had if they do come back willy nilly why did the god of destruction not just destroy all life himself when he happens to be there already why not create hundreds of salems the return of the gods and the second leaving is pretty random and to be honest this would make no good story same goes for the child loss so salem is just a flat character who overreacted to an emotional event and is now over the top evil becouse that is a reasonable course of action and ozpin managed to surpass mortality simply becouse he does not want to die yet if it would be so easy to not die i am sure there would be tons of immortals salem clearly has a grudge against ozpin and propably humanity as well but i sure hope her reason is a bit more complex and deeper and not just an emotional overreaction that got out of hand and hopefully her way to power is something more sinister or complex than the gods coming back and granting a wish to one random person ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,in that case jaune would be the perfect candidate to stop salem becouse you know he is the one character who we know is moving forward so far ruby seems to be mostly in denial still naive and therefore unable to confront someone with the bitter truth becouse she herself has not done any mourning of which we know she is still the naive child just a little bit grown up the other problem is the gods supposedly left the earth after creating humanity and they worked together to do this so there is no point for the dark brother to give any power to salem both gods gave humanity the freedom to create and destroy giving salem more power to destroy defeats this purpose the gods already made the perfect creation with humanity the dark god giving salem a special treatment undermines that also salem explicitly want to see ozpin burn in your theory she would just hate the world for a pretty stupid reason so becouse her innocent child died she now kills innocent children and adults as well does not make any sense and ozpin has done nothing wrong at all so her hatred for him is also not reasonable and ruby is not the only person on remnant who has faced death this is a dangerous world there was a giant freaking war and most likely a lot of people who learned to accept death some of them are propably part of wtch ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,considering people tend to break glasses whenever he is near there is little reason to think it is not his semblance the fight with tyrian also showed several instances that seem like the semblance in action ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,why would he unless he is almost allknowing what is the point of rigging them and if he did he did a very poor job as pyrrha and jaune landed with quite the distance and if it was not for her he would be dead also he could not rig the relics as well so there is no reason to think he did rig anything ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,ozpin did not assign any teams ,5,RWBY
Shuizid,nice one tip for the hair as it is only dragged along while her head swing left the hair shoul be on the right side and vice versa ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,tyrian ruby did interfere to help qrow and she did indeed help him unlike ren and nora before where qrow said they should keep out ,6,RWBY
Shuizid,some part the lack of light and a big part lack of skill ,2,Re_Zero
Shuizid,this is so true that was basically at least the second time something could be put into a wor episode rather than a monologe within an episode first with the history of menagery though maybe even the story of the maidens which pyrrha tells in v3 it is kinda disappointing seeing so much potential going to waste ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,ok so why would summer threaten the tribe the silver eyes only work against grimm and maybe somehow against maidens so unless raven leads a tribe of grimm there is nothing to fear plus why should summer attack the tribe anyway ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,you know the story of the gods kinda took more time to develope something than we have seen characters getting this season xd crwby really lacks in that department weiss and yang took like 5sec to change their mind and overcome their seemingly biggest problem in the arc meanwhile we get like 5 minutes talk about how there exist powerfull relics which kinda are just there raven is still quite mysterious but i would assume it might be her semblance or another special ability she is not clairvoyant as she asked qrow about the relic which she should know if she can predict the future or so especially knowing the fall of beacon sounds simply like she is less naive and knows about ozpins flaws and weaknesses while the others believed he would handle it for the other questions well i honestly do not know if she would have such a powerfull relic you know the power of knowledge trumps everything xd she could have easily prevented the fall of beacon and pretty much anything bad that could ever happen ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,sure they might keep some secrets but if the maidens are really so important not telling rnjr feels kinda odd it seems like they are going for the relic while the maidens seem to be the more pressing issue also the ability to use something is not what i would call guarding a guard is someone who protects and object from the use of others the best guarding the maidens could do what be to be as far away from the relics as possible and then my brain hits they could be guardians of humanity by using their power and the relics against whatever threat there is though the process of becoming a maiden would be very dangerous considering until recent there was no chance of knowing if a maiden would be a good guardian or someone who would threaten the world with their power ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,if the maidens would be guardians this could have been told in the story of the gods i mean ozpin surely would know about this and tell his closest allies so even if it is not common knowledge qrow should have dumped it on jnpr as he did with the existence of the relics needing the maidens to use the relics would be an interesting twist but for now there is no link established between the maidens and the relics or the gods or well anything the maidens are just there and we barely know what exactly they can do nor why salem is specifically looking for spring maiden next the talk between qrow and raven made it sound like salem would win by getting the spring maiden meanwhile the relic was not so important i mean raven is asking if she has it meaning even if salem would have it it would not be the end of the world otherwise raven would know she does not as the world did not end yet wrote it in another comment the maidens beeing the key for unlocking the relics sounds a bit weird this would imply the story of the maidens beeing wrong as the relics were created alongside humanity and the maidens some time later also a key is kind of the opposite of a guardian a guardian is protecting something however if only the maidens can use them they would only need to protect the relics from themself you are right for now the maidens clearly are more important to salem than the relics but to me linking them to the relics does not seem appropriate ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,have not seen the latest wor yet but as ozpin mentioned helping someone build an academy this king might be just his predecessor would surely explain the similarity to the cane needing the maidens to use the relics does not work out as we know the relics were created at the same time as the humans the maidens were not so both beeing even connected is already quite the stretch unless the wizard was a guardian for the relics and just got so bored that he split this power up and gave it the 4 maidens you know otherwise there would be the super powerfull relics without anybody beeing able to use them what would be the point of that and why even create guardian if this guardian is the only one who could use them anyway this way he would be guarding them from himself i kinda doubt v4 will answer a lot of questions they had the exposition dump with qrow talking about the gods and nobody even asking the question why the current grimm do not act like those in the story and now our exposition vessel is sick and unable to talk unless we see ozpin having a lengthy talk with ozcar there is not much space for exposition ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,kinda doubt that technically the brothers could have come back and do whatever but the light brother could create life neither ozpin nor the maidens seem to be able to do anything even remotely close to that ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,true though i do not recall the wizard of oz giving people magic powers though i am also not to familiar with the story either i mean we could go and make up which character represents who from the original story jaune is the lion in need of courage weiss needed a heart i surely need a brain xd,1,RWBY
Shuizid,weiss and yang are almost ready to go back into the field and do whatever yang and tai might go to find ruby weiss could join the atlas military seeing as ironwood is the only person she met so far that seems to share her views we do not know much about klein oppinion but he does not seem to be much of a help outside of their home blake will have a serious talk with her family and propably go to haven or whatever rnjr will propably meet some big and dangerous grim and either loose qrow for good or get rescued by whoever is able to do so or maybe ruby uses her silver eyes again ,4,RWBY
Shuizid,good old ozpin is dead his soul has chosen a new protector of humanity or whatever ozpins role was unlesss ozpin is lying he went throw the same process havin a second soul not just in his body but fused to his own as he already said the 2 of them are no longer different beeing they are one even though oscar is controlling the body their memories already are fused to the point they each can recall what the other has seen and done oscar will replace ozpin just like ozpin replaced whoever was before him oscar might take up some of ozpins behaviors as ozpin looked for someone who is quite similar to him and ofcourse the shared memories might also influence future behavior however ozpin wo not come back quite the contrary he will surely become less and less present until only ozcar is left as the new protector ,6,RWBY
Shuizid,no on steam you buy access to a stream ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,1 dunno though people hearing stuff in movies and films which would be impossible to hear normally is quite common so they could have planned for ruby to hear that line in the first place and the actual scene was just to long i watched a lot of cinemasins on youtube and it is quite common there we also have the scene with yang hearing how tai talked about following ruby while standing rather far away and behind a window and i think tai was kinda whispering as well 2 yeah there is no hard evidence meaning this is just completely made up without any support just like the theory of roman beeing rubys actual father which i just made up without evidence we can make up whatever we want 3 and now we have quite a strong counter argument as well as the surely weak point in 1 not enough to fully disprove it ofcourse 5 could bring some interesting outcomes like adam happening to be at 2 places at once though propably wo not happen would end up to irritating to watch not having a clear flow of time ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,dust does not seem to need a soul to be activated hence it can be used in weapons and is the reason for the technology in atlas heating up a home with dust would be rather painfull if someone has to sit in the oven and ignite the dust with his her soul the question at hand is why do you need the soul anyway it feels like explaining dust like gunpowder except it can create a lot more than explosions seems perfectly fine so we have exploding powder gravity powder freeze powder electric powder those can be activated with small addition of energy which can be soul but also a sneeze and whatever the trigger of a weapon does to it and maidens can call forth such effects without using dust magic your addition of the soul in this equation feels more like the need to fill in all 3 words you took from chemistry and not like something actually needed to explaining it ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,most likely not we did not see how much time has passed but assuming this is parallel to ruby blake is in menagery for a couple of days at best without the cct just getting the message to adam will take much longer and assuming all the storys are playing at the same time it took blake several months to get home i do not remember how big the timeskip was but surely 2 or 3 months so unless adam is a wizard has a plain or is for whatever weird reason in menagery already he cannot be there ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,yang getting back in shape so quickly also pissed me off she lost an arm and this changed quite a lot in the series one of the maincast the brightest and strongest and head throw wall character was broken this opened up quite the possibility for an interesting character developement which is why i personally was certain she would not get a new arm at all it would mostly undercut the whole experience what is the point of loosing a limb if you can just get a new one while living pretty much in the middle of nowhere and broken down global communication yang loosing an arm raised the stakes quite a lot and yet now everything is almost back to normal now she is training again maybe learning a lesson about fighting and done new yang established with almost no work whatsoever she pretty much went from ptsd moping around back into the training mode with just 2 scenes give her a 3rd scene for learning a new way of fighting and at least once beating tai either they lack the time or artistical inspiration to do more with her or maybe just maybe she will have a harsh setback soon if not well then nothing has changed for her at all ofcourse the explanation for the arm itself is simple ironwood is awesome and penny is proof they know how to create living metal with it own soul so creating an arm that can pretty much connect to that soul and act and feel like a natural arm is not that big of a stretch and what we have already seen ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,if gravity would be lower so would be the muscle build up meaning they still could not jump higher they would be weaker to the point we would not notice any difference this would only make sense if we assume they train in gravity enhancing environments like in dragonball z as they did not this lense does not offer any explanation whatsoever ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,1 pyrrha is dead and she wo not come back there is nothing in the story hinting at anything that could allow her to come back to life so they propably just reused some sound files maybe ruby just imagined that dialog in her dream and due to reused voicelines it was the actual dialog but has no meaning 2 no indication of anything like that 3 they made a pretty big deal out of the taking quite a long time to figure out how the maidens powers work also that it is hard finding the maidens and making sure they are safe if the maidens would give forth their consciusness they could explain the whole situation and surely it would become much easier to protect them we do not know what cinder has to fight but salem said the maidens power is the reason she could not fight the silver eyes so maybe there is some side effect if that still in her system considering the giant grim is most likely still frozen the effect of the silver eyes wo not stop to soon 4 interesting idea 5 they should roughly happen at the same time ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,well there goes the last string to my already weak bow xd good points i am convinced thanks for the effort ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,good counter point for the forging of scenes us not knowing about blakes parents made a nice reveal scene in an episode that unfortunately had rather on the nose exposition about menagerie which sun should have known as faunus or just becouse he lives in that world which kinda shows some flaws there though i think there is another point the genre up until the end of v3 rwby was pretty much about school life and mostly slice of life kinda funny i did not watched many of such anime or other shows but i recall them not paying a lot of attention on the family or parents at all heck i bet many cartoons featuring even young characters barely pay attention to parents or family unless the topic gets more mature was it bad writing not for me sure this looks like a reveal that is for the audience and not exactly natural but at the same time nobody bothered before nobody asked why did ruby never ask blake about her family or how many siblings weiss has or i at least never witnessed something like that so if people do not had an issue with that before they totally deserved getting this unexpected turn of events this is basically blaming the creators for not telling us something nobody wanted to know they made a story and a world which with the given knowledge seemed satisfying for everyone i mean everyone just assumed blake is an orphan and was happy with that i would say this was a mistake as well though i can easily identify with crwby my schoolfriends took like one year to learn i have a sister and another half to learn i have 2 just never was in a situation where this felt like important information so i am like blake in this scenario xd,3,RWBY
Shuizid,considering how weak the strong evidence are why even bother clothing is nothing genetic therefore they could wear the exact same outfit and it would still be worth nothing ruby did know qrow from signal and he is well he is the uncle of yang and not ruby oddly enough still though they know eachother from a very young age so he did influence her choice of style ,7,RWBY
Shuizid,we know about winter becouse she visited the school and weiss and her father was important for her motivation to become a huntress her brother up until know had no purpose for her character nora and ren beeing orphans was not developed she just mentioned in one rather funny scene that both have no home to go back to pyrrha mentioned her mother like once telling us she existed at one point in the past that is not something i would call exposition family was only mentioned when it was important for the scene weiss for her motivation yang for lecturing blake nora for a quick joke pyrrha becouse someone had to tell her the story of the maidens ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,they just never were important weiss never talked about her family heck rwby propably did not know her daddy issues yet not talking about her brother is a problem he just has not done anything same for blake nobody in the entire show talked much about their family except maybe jaune once in the first episodes so it is not just blake and weiss it is also pyrrha nora ren yang and ruby we still know pretty much nothing about tai and summer one could call it bad writing i would just say the story never came to a point where this would be fitting especially weiss and blake are both not exactly open characters weiss wo not talk about her family due to knowing what her father did with the sdc and blake well now we know she pretty much ran away from home ofcourse she wo not just openly talk about her nice and caring family she throw away to follow now known psychopath adam ,4,RWBY
Shuizid,propably ruby is still not taking this whole world at the brink of war thing seriously also taking the themesong into account this season will not be the point where we will see a lot of heroes so another death is entirely possible while at the same time ozcar surely needs some allies to fight against salem so killing of qrow is quite the handicap for the story but on the other hand with a story planed for like 10 volumes there is a lot of time to find new ones qrow will be out of the picture for quite a while that is for sure if there will be another fight with now crippled tyrian a fully capable qrow would not make an intersting battle either raven takes him or he will rest in a village now that i think about it he cannot die he is the only person who can fill in ruby on anything raven wo not goodwitch is busy ironwood is at the other end of the world and ozpin has other issues as well rnjr does not even know what to do in haven they do not have any reputation to be taken seriously by anybody there meaning without qrow the story cannot progress so maybe they will rest with qrow becouse heck there is little else they can do ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,well we only see dust beeing used as a weapon the other uses are for machines making it warm in atlas allowing robots to move planes to fly we do not directly see the dust in use but this is how they work this is like looking for different uses of coal there are only little options to use something that can only be burnt same goes for the other dust types we know there just seems to be little variety in practical use ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,oh i see remembered it incorrectly ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,can you tell me what situations you mean i did watch them but before rewatching them i would like to know what you are referring to ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,salem definitely has a personal grudge on ozpin where this did come from surely will be explained in later episodes but she surely is more on a revenge path than a simple watch the world burn or reshape in her image after all whatever her goals might be must be acceptable for the other characters of her party as well and only tyrian seems like someone who would enjoy pointless mayhem ,4,RWBY
Shuizid,good old kant just remember this does not work for every action ,3,LifeProTips
Shuizid,you forgot the moon is a giant floating pile of rocks ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,it was stated by the monty himself that yang and ruby are related by blood ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,in remnant terms we still have not seen anything called magic by characters ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,you can bring up as much confirmation bias support to an officially debunked theory as you want it wo not become true unless you explain why the heck qrow should have a child with his own sister ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,you think qrow would not notice his semblance is turn into a bird o o maybe he can do it due to magic there seems to be magic in this world so a characters actually using it even the maidens powers are only closer to magic would be possible raven uses this weird portal so maybe the branwen have knowledge about some magic ,12,RWBY
Shuizid,yang and ruby related by blood is the official actual truth so you are suggesting becouse rubys aura is red and qrow is grew he impregnated his own sister yangs mother nice try ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,as we do not know the actual power of the relics it is hard to tell possible though this person would have fked up if they failed to do something more usefull with them ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,it is said the moon has phases though i do not know if shattering fixing or simply spinning unlike our moon and therefore not always having the shattered parts visible ,2,RWBY
Shuizid, to me it looks like the 2 ends are connected to eachother but not to her gun at all xd,2,RWBY
Shuizid,well he did invade a very private family moment to give her information she clearly does not want and we should not forget she never wanted sun on her side to begin with so far he is nothing but a nuisance except the fight on the boat the slapping itselfs well woman slapping men is not exactly a new invention here and throwing away stuff does not seem to be serious in rwby like jaune and his scroll or map which both are fine ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,hopefully though this would at least be bad writing the characters should know the actual behavior of the grim and therefore know the story does not fit the world they live in considering they do not makes this sound like they believe the story which means the creators think this is solid and therefore making this the actual lore which just includes this contradiction you know if the creators knew this would be wrong they should have thought about how the characters react to the contradiction ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,you are right we also only assume ozpin is the wizard of legends yet we have no proof for that either personally i thought ozpin and salem would be the gods of remnant so the story would be a good way to cover up that truth xd meanwhile the relics might offer a new motivation for salem which is an interesting turn as well with those second thoughts i do like the concept of the story not beeing true making it so that even ozpin is keeping some secrets for himself entirely which thanks to his rebirth is totally possible as those secrets cannot be lost ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,maybe that is some kind of magic after all we do know magic exists in this world and is different from aura and semblance what bothers me is qrow said his name was due to his semblance would not that mean he once had another name or was he born with this semblance and his tribe just decided to base his name on that how could they have known it maybe the tribe has some special magic stuff at hand like the teleportation portal which i would assume is also some kind of magic ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,well only the strong shall survive means qrow helping ruby was a sign of weakness however he might be just to valuable for raven to let him die ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,i would assume the story is part of the actual lore of the world why else would we be told this story yeah the people of remnant might have a lot of different stories and religious believes however we do not get to here those but this one most likely becouse the creators wanted us to hear it as it contains valuable information about the world which is unfortunate becouse the story contradicts something we actually know in one of the earlier wor episodes about grim it was specifically said they only attack human and nothing else any conflict with animals only happens becouse of territorial fight however now it was said the grim were designed to destroy all living things which would mean they should attack animals and even plants unless someone manipulated the original grim to only attack humans dunno if that would be possible ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,intersting theory but based on a false assumption documents are not nearly as important in the worl of remnant surely they had to do some illegal stuff to be considered exchange students but it is not that hard there are a lot of people living outside the main kingdoms having differnt rules and most likely only little documentation so getting into one school with little stuff is easy together with that pretty flawed documentation i would assume so is the rest that allowed cmen to happen semblance are nowhere documented just like weapons and there might not be any physical control after all penny was also accepted into the tournament and she was 0 human and cmen only learnt about pyrrha semblance by engaging her in combat ,0,RWBY
Shuizid,they are in the middle of nowhere finding a doctor alone will already be hard raven could help but does she want he is no longer part of her tribe and he certainly has no usefull invormation for her unless he gets lucky writing there is a good chance he is done for good ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,well this topic already discussed the colors of the farmboy and one comment even mentions his weird looking eyes https www reddit com r rwby comments 5921w3 the amazing technicolor character ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,seems like he can recreate all kinds of stuff he dropped considering he also sitll has a scroll after throwing it onto the ground in the last episode of volume 3 ,2,RWBY
Shuizid,it had quite some downsides blake explaining the geography of menagerie to sun was a lot of telling over showing of something sun should have already known and for the audience they should have just put it into the wor and make blake in return explaining the history white fang to sun as this is something he should not have learned just by beeing a faunus nitpicking i know xd for the rest it really feels kinda slow and speed up at the same time thanks to having like more than 4 arcs who all want to go somewhere rngj blake weiss yang oz wtch and while there is a lot of ground to cover it does not feel like they do do not get me wrong i do like the episodes and the characters but i cannot say a lot of stuff is happening so far rngj was just walking around with a glimpse of ruby nightmares and jaune training blake got to menagerie and so far did nothing weiss still dislikes her father and now we know she also hates the other high society as well yang did put on her arm so that a major progress though there was barely any build up in the like 10 minutes she had from moping around to beeing combat ready again oh an ozpin talks to random farmboy throw a mirror dunno i feel like this is not much considering we already got half the season but maybe i am wrong and everything is fine and i just like complaining o o,5,RWBY
Shuizid,not to much of a stretch but there was no indication cinder did save data she was streaming or remote controlling that was what she needed and up until the end nobody did consider any student a threat i mean could happen but i do not think it fits the narrative yang currently has her recovering arc after loosing against a major antagonist ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,how would he know where her home is a small building in the middle of the woods and he kinda lacks any source for that as well it is not like he can look into a phone book ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,well the thing is if this is true he pretty much failed all the time ruby beat roman and was not stopped by sun meaning the fall of beacon did only happen becouse ruby was late well ok adam and cinder would cut down ruby if it was not for her silver eyes activating if i was adam i would have fired sun a long time ago as he had no use so far the major flaw however is if sun wanted to capture blake why did not he do it himself in v2e4 standing around is quite passive you know he could just grab blake and get caught at this point there was no reason for him playing innocent if he really wanted to capture blake those coincidence might seem weird but while this potato tries to explain them it fails in a major aspect looking for falsification if sun really was an enemy he could and should have done a lot worse things capturing blake here interfering there instead he tried to help rwby and why would he even bother with rwby in the first place they are weak every major antagonist could beat them no problem except maybe roman so what mission could sun possible have that wo not make him blow his cover long before v4 ,6,RWBY
Shuizid,qrow talks about ozpin beeing missing in the final episode of season 3 at this time he supposedly already has the cane as this would have been in the basement of the tower and i sure doubt he would go there again qrow has the cane as he was the last one at the tower and there might be other reasons for him beeing the narrator eg the lack of other people to do that i am concerned about salem talking of ozpin in the present tense during the final episode in volume 3 while also talking about cinder killing him in the first episode of volume 4 and while ozpin is mysterious enough to be the wizard this theory has quite a hole considering the way they explain the rules of the maidens powers to pyrrha they talk like those rules were hard to discover which should not happen if ozpin is in one way or another the wizard who created those powers in the first place also as the wizard or someone with the wizards powers why would he loose to a maiden cinder had quite the trouble killing one maiden even with 2 people helping her but at the same time salem and ozpin seem to be connected and the grimm are born at salems home making it look like she is more or less the source of them and as grimm are at least as old as mankind so must salem but does that mean ozpin is too wah i cannot get my head around that xd i am still troubled by what ruby once said ozpin acting like he is not there at his first speech at beacon and qrow seeming more nad more like ozpin as well as qrows scythe having those signiture clock that where surrounding ozpin workplace ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,sounds really solid i hoped he would be the reincarnation of ozpin xd the dude is really weird seemingly living alone on a quite big farm in the middle of nowhere looking concerned into the distance well one way or another the show needs a replacement for ozpin someone who knows what is going on and able to guide whatever force against salem ,1,RWBY
Shuizid,uh good idea i will keep that in mind when i draw her again ,3,RWBY
Shuizid,might be different from song to song personally i recently started to use a song to wake me up that i absolutely love and now when my alarm rings instead of putting it into sleepmode after about 2sec i listen to the song takes a minute before the alarm stops it and then i am rather awake and ready to do stuff well i do play with my phone but that much more than hitting sleepmode for half an hour this might change after a couple of weeks but for now this song is the best alarm i ever had ,1,LifeProTips
Shuizid,in order to become succesfull you need to become known while posting stuff on a regular base is important you cannot expect people running around on those pages looking for unknown artist to make them popular share your art in some groups connect to others using forums and ofcourse you need to put out art rather constantly you might also try creating fanart and use fitting tags you people looking for those will eventually find your art and therefore you college is not needed and there are like millions of videos on youtube telling you everything you would need to become a good artist ,15,Art
Shuizid,the point is the thief might think one of those 3 is the actual pin thus tries them and after the 3rd one the card is blocked you should not write down any correct pin anywhere ,8,LifeProTips
Shuizid,ah my bad sry just wondering is there a reason for the r fanart to not be listed in the art related subredits in rule 11 ,1,Art
Shuizid,7 times edr doubles your current dps so it is not useless however in order to make it usefull someone would need to play in one world for quite a while considering upgarding heroes 25 levels already gives 4times their damage ,1,ClickerHeroes
Shuizid,the game calculates your offline gold by the highest beaten zone and the caclulation is so you basically get the same amount of gold like beeing online therefore there is no difference in beeing online or offline for farming the only actual difference is that the offlinemode does not count chests as beaten for the achievement even though it calculates gold like you would also fight chests ,1,ClickerHeroes
Shuizid,they never become entirely useless however you need way more hs in order to get a bonus by leveling them up if you level up siyalatas and it only gives 15 bonus damage than you need to look if the hs you spend are relatively less than the 15 considering the bonus you already have example if siyalatas gives 15000 bonus dps then 15 is like getting a multiplier on your idle dps of 1 001 0 1 bonus so if you spend more than 0 1 of your hs you will losse dps however since hs stack infinitely there is always a point where levling up siyalatas still gives more reative bonus than you loose by loosing hs the bonus ist just really small and the higher siy is the more irrelevant the bonus gets ,2,ClickerHeroes
Shuizid,with some hs i go basically for the highest hero then wait a bit and get the highest i can afford skipping some heroes or having them on 1 i do this until the progress slows down or they cannot kill bosses then i upgrade one to the 100 and wait again and at the time that is not enough i start upgrading regulary and just upgrade the earlier heros 100times and hit the purchase all upgrades button becaus at this time their cost is insignificant ,1,ClickerHeroes
Shuizid,not for 2 hs on the first run i ascended for 7 later for more it is recommended to have at least 7 hs before ascending the first time later for more however whenever the game starts to feel to slow ascending is recommended ,1,ClickerHeroes
Shuizid,well there is a difference while scientific counts every digit this notation would only count every 3rd and even the number of digits is useless because the damage and gold each use about 2 symbols each at one time while looking at a number i only need to compare it to the next higher if looking at single hero golddrop or lower one looking at total damage gold and can make up my mind about how long something will which most likely is around that numbers as well however i guess someone can get used to scientific notation but it would be cool to have some alternative for example instead of counting every digit it only counts every three beeing semi scientific instead of 2 154e7 it would be 21 54e6 this would basically work the same as the nonscientific method in use without the need of more symbols and it would still be scientifically correct and it would not force poeple to compare like 7 forms of exx when before they had to compare like 3 to figure out which hero is actually benefiting there damage and which will after some upgrades ,1,ClickerHeroes
Shuizid,neither happens the game saves every 30sec and if closed the next time it opens it uses a formula to caclulate the offline gold from that save this formula uses the highest region you have reached in this world not the last region you were in ,7,ClickerHeroes
