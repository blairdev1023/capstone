SuperChu132,thanks for the spot on rant man as a d va main i can personally testify to just about everything you covered in here like many others are saying and probably thinking d va desperately needs her armor back even if they do not touch the cannons on the meka simply restoring her old 200hp 400ar setup would give so much life back into a previously devastating character that way you could take advantage of her armor to bait protect or even brawl with lone enemies dual non healer groups with her defense matrix of course just like any d va main i wish for the pre nerf d va because she was just so good would gild you fine sir but i am broke haha ,3,OverwatchUniversity
