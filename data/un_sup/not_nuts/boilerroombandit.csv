boilerroombandit,the whole transaxle lineage is fairly unloved despite the fact that they are the cars that saved porsche from financial death the 924 once turbocharged became a damn decent car to chase 911s in and outrun base corvettes of the same era not to mention the carrera gt variant that is simply cool the 944 was a well thought out upgrade using the wider stance from the carrera gt and shedding the audi engine stigma that still plauges it predecessor and finally the 968 was certainly the pinnacle of the chassis development with the larger displacement the engine finally made torque without a turbo strapped to it and it was more comfortable to drive long distances i love all transaxle porsches and happily own two 924 turbo cars ,4,ThingsCutInHalfPorn
boilerroombandit,yup the 968 chassis is an updated version of the 944 and can trace it lineage back to 1976 with the launch of the 924 the 3 0l engine is an upgraded version of the 2 5l engine used in the 944 albeit a with dual overhead cam design all three versions of the chassis have their merit and individual reasons for being awesome ,2,ThingsCutInHalfPorn

boilerroombandit,ok soon to be old vehicle owner here the low down as a dealership employee and the owner of a 1976 ford courier i play in this realm regularly inspection there is no law that you have to get an insurance inspection however almost every insurance agency has a policy in place to make you do that age of the vehicle can vary from 10 to 15 years wawanisa i know for a fact is 13 years this is actually to your benefit because the forms are publicly available and make an excellent check list to use when buying an old vehicle insurance inspection form in pdf http www simsinsurance ca forms vir pdf as an aside on the inspection thing you need to be absolutely certain that that vehicle is in the alberta system just because it has a plate does not mean that the insurance companies have it on file anymore if it is out of the system it requires an out of province inspection which is much more thorough more expensive and a much bigger pain in the ass to pass ask me how i know insurance this is completely up to you and your provider you may qualify for a discounted rate for multiple products with your insurer so be sure to ask about that do not be afraid to shop around though and make sure you note how helpful the person giving you a quote is as that speaks to corporate culture now on to the section i like to call so you have bought an old car it pays to go over all that you can with a fine tooth comb if you have no experience with a vehicle this old try to find someone who does and take them to it being an old work vehicle i would thoroughly expect every bushing to be shot the steering linkages to be worn out and the engine to need a refresh if this vehicle is still being driven on a semi regular basis then that works in your favor cause you can test drive it and see if anything feels funny but you will still end up having an inspection to go through that pretty much it to me older vehicles have more personality and are a lot of fun if you are mechanically inclined then you can keep them going really afford ably and with a few minor upgrades here and there they can last for a long time if you have any other questions do not be afraid to ask cheers,5,Calgary

boilerroombandit,i have always loved the opposite story about how slow an sr71 could go the story comes from retired america air force maj brian shul and it was posted by our friends over at sierra hotel aeronautics who generously allowed us to share it here here s shul on the blackbird s speed as a former sr 71 pilot and a professional keynote speaker the question i m most often asked is how fast would that sr 71 fly i can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event i attend it s an interesting question given the aircraft s proclivity for speed but there really isn t one number to give as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to it was common to see 35 miles a minute because we flew a programmed mach number on most missions and never wanted to harm the plane in any way we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed thus each sr 71 pilot had his own individual high speed that he saw at some point on some mission i saw mine over libya when khadafy fired two missiles my way and max power was in order let s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to mach numbers we hadn t previously seen so it was with great surprise when at the end of one of my presentations someone asked what was the slowest you ever flew the blackbird this was a first after giving it some thought i was reminded of a story that i had never shared before and i relayed the following i was flying the sr 71 out of raf mildenhall england with my back seater walt watson we were returning from a mission over europe and the iron curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base as we scooted across denmark in three minutes we learned that a small raf base in the english countryside had requested an sr 71 fly past the air cadet commander there was a former blackbird pilot and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty sr 71 perform a low approach no problem we were happy to do it after a quick aerial refuelling over the north sea we proceeded to find the small airfield walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat and began to vector me toward the field descending to subsonic speeds we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze like most former wwii british airfields the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure walter told me we were close and that i should be able to see the field but i saw nothing nothing but trees as far as i could see in the haze we got a little lower and i pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at with the gear up anything under 275 was just uncomfortable walt said we were practically over the field yet there was nothing in my windscreen i banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field meanwhile below the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly past it was a quiet still day with no wind and partial gray overcast walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze i couldn t see it the longer we continued to peer out the window and circle the slower we got with our power back the awaiting cadets heard nothing i must have had good instructors in my flying career as something told me i better cross check the gauges as i noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots my heart stopped and my adrenalin filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward at this point we weren t really flying but were falling in a slight bank just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame and what a joyous feeling that was the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower shattering the still quiet of that morning they now had 107 feet of fire breathing titanium in their face as the plane levelled and accelerated in full burner on the tower side of the infield closer than expected maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife edge pass quickly reaching the field boundary we proceeded back to mildenhall without incident we didn t say a word for those next 14 minutes after landing our commander greeted us and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings instead he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest sr 71 fly past he had ever seen especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking he said that some of the cadet s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable walt and i both understood the concept of breathtaking very well that morning and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach as we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits we just sat there we hadn t spoken a word since the pass finally walter looked at me and said one hundred fifty six knots what did you see trying to find my voice i stammered one hundred fifty two we sat in silence for a moment then walt said don t ever do that to me again and i never did a year later walter and i were having lunch in the mildenhall officer s club and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an sr 71 fly past that he had seen one day of course by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows noticing our habu patches as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred walt just shook his head and said it was probably just a routine low approach they re pretty impressive in that plane impressive indeed ,13,AskReddit

boilerroombandit,bill 6 is just the start of what is going to happen to everyone but i will get to that later there are a few issues with bill 6 the first and foremost being that it treats all farms regardless of size as the same that means the big corporate guys and my family operation are swept into the same category that would be like saying a family doctor has to scrub up each time they see a patient like a surgeon does they are both doctors so they should do the same thing not quite that simple second being mandatory wcb coverage lots of farmers already have insurance that goes above and beyond what wcb can provide but now they do not have a choice should there be mandatory coverage if you have employees yes few farmers will argue that some will and i know a couple thirdly oh s this shit lights me up all farms are to be subject to the rulings of oh s the cost of upgrading machinery fitting safety cages fall protection confined spaces forklift heavy equipment training necessary will cripple a farm in a heart beat but because it oh s nothing can be grandfathered the first officer to start writing tickets on a family farm more than 3 hours from any city will learn something college could not teach them finally and most importantly is the view point nobody in the city thinks of or has seen a family farm is not just a business when you leave work at the end of the day you go home you get to leave the bureaucracy paperwork people behind unless you are an entrepreneur a family farm is a person home it both their livelihood and their place to unwind so ask yourself if the government said that every person is now on call by their employer and we will be sending oh s into your house to verify compliance would not that piss you off just a little bit finally if you think it just the farmers who are getting ignored while bills are getting rammed through think again http m edmontonsun com 2015 12 02 alberta school boards say havent been consulted over bill 8,0,Calgary

boilerroombandit, how about a tax decrease for low volume alberta breweries and this here is why i get worked up about these articles two sentences about what the aglc did before the changes but not what is happening now the tax rate for small brewers is now progressive two examples would be dandy and tool shed their rates have effectively been halved now why the ndp could not do that without the interprovincial hike i do not know all i can do is speculate ,1,beercanada
boilerroombandit,i am sad for the out of province breweries i am sad for the importers who brought in beer i am sad that the brewers have been able to ship their beer into alberta and grow their brand exponentially quicker than they would if they stayed in their own province i am sad that the importers who rode a tidal wave of craft beer growth and energy can no longer mark their product up and gouge us simply because a beer is on the hype train and there is so much more to be sad about too i am sad that our local breweries can grow at a progressive rate without hitting an artificial ceiling i am sad that there will be more jobs created by beer than by oil this year because of the ndp stupid decision i am sad that in a province where we scream and cry that jobs are being lost left right and center we bemoan the loss of one or two breweries products instead of cheer at the fact that we will gain 10 or more breweries over the next 2 3 years in all seriousness now while the ndp has been heavy handed and unrelentingly swift in changing policy here in alberta this is the first change they have made that will directly benefit albertans first you only have to look at minhas for their loophole usage and steam whistle and yukon brewing to see two brewers who took advantage of the alberta advantage to it fullest having chatted with a few brewers about this news i can safely say that no one is truly happy that the playing field is not level but that not an alberta issue all these breweries need to take their words and efforts to their local government and hopefully enact change on a national scale until that happens though i am just going to have to drown my sorrows in fresh new beer that i can get in my back yard ,7,beercanada

boilerroombandit,absolutely which is part of the reason i linked tire racks survey result page because anecdotes only become evidence when applied to a metric in large quantities however studded tires all face the same issue regardless of tire they are installed in is that they actually reduce the contact patch of the tire on pavement and take up siping area that is a detriment to handling the majority of the time you are on the road of course i can understand planning for the worst case scenario and buying accordingly ,2,Calgary
