PM_meyour_closeshave,i am not saying we should not have any options for small loans what i was originally saying is that we had laws in place that protected us from ridiculous interest rates then all the money lender parent corporations got together and said hey if we group up and make a 700 million donation to some canadian leaders they will overturn the legislation that prevents us from making an absolutely disgusting amount of money from the poorest people in society so the legislation was rescinded and now instead of offering reasonable loans at a reasonable rate they are allowed to offer loans that previous leaders leaders that actually cared about their people knew were bad for society my complaint is not about the idea of small loans to help people in need it about the fact that we had laws in place to protect them which we overturned in the name of profit now instead of a loan that would have been a bit of a pain to pay back you have a loan that gets forgotten about until it completely ruins your financial future i have been in shitty situations i have stolen food toilet paper and at my worst had to sleep outside there just no place for these loans as they are there no time during any of my past experiences that one of these loans would have benefited me as they are any other option is better but they are sold to people who do not know any better and do not actually understand the depths of what they might be getting into life sucks for everyone pretty much all the time and our leaders overturned laws to make things worse for the worst off of us all ,2,personalfinance

PM_meyour_closeshave,i think that actually part of the reason for the stigma associated with modern mental health back when we lived like they do on game of thrones the public execution was common place and young people we would consider far too young were married off to start having children of their own i do not know if now because we live such sheltered lives that violence has a much bigger impact or if it was just normal for everyone to have serious issues back then but mental health all seems to stem from a variation from what we consider normal maybe everyone had to do what jamie did to some extent or another and that was just how they rolled or maybe normal for them was just a world surrounded by day to day death and violence now when someone has an issue it mostly because they do not fit into normal and we want to help them get there but some people cannot help but think why cannot you just be normal which for some people is not as easy as getting up in the morning ,1,AskReddit

PM_meyour_closeshave,that was some of my concern as well a chain in tension can hold absurd amounts of weight in line with the chain but if you stress a chain in tension from the side the forces get multiplied massively if you pulled your 1000lbs capacity chain across 10 horizontally with enough tension to keep it straight i do not think you could hang 200lbs at the centre point without breaking the chain or more likely ripping out an anchor also anything that going to hold something subject to impact usually uses a x10 safety factor so if you want to catch something that weighs 50lbs you want it to be able to hold 500lbs i do not know how much impacting you had in mind and you almost definitely do not need a 10x factor for something like this but make sure you are well in excess of the dead weight you want to hang ,2,DIY
