salerwat,prey 2006 had no idea what it was all i saw was fps and horror and i wanted to play it that game is everything amazing portal puzzles story and an ending to keep you waiting forever for a sequel that will never be thanks to this game i also can say prey 2017 the new prey bore the name of an almost unbeatable story to me i did not want anything to do with it did not keep an eye on it and had no idea what it was about other than it still was not the sequel i was waiting for i read one comment on steam comparing it to exploring rapture for the first time and i bought the game instantly blew my fucking mind i have to say it is easily in my top 5 games of all time now going in expecting nothing and becoming so invested in it to have my breath taken at almost every turn just like the original prey ,1,AskReddit

salerwat,i think the whole premise of not saying the names of the movie heroes is part of luke cages story nobody cares about the big heroes off in their own world doing things on a large scale that really do not have much effect on the regular people living their lives being wiped out by alien races aside it just entertainment for them yet one of these super powered people start helping out on the streets making a difference for the people directly they make note of his name they recognize him and by the end cheer it in support of him simply put thor iron man and hulk are just something you see on the news it does not concern you outside of oh that could have been bad but they stopped it whereas luke cage is here doing good for you your family your friends and your town so you make sure you know his name just my opinion what i got from it ,15,marvelstudios
