LouGossetJr,i still think there more happy customers than dissatisfied customers like most of the complaints i see in these threads most are user error whether it overloading overpowering underpowering etc almost all atomizers use either silicone or peek insulators when they are mass produced there always a chance of some type of shorting and potential melting that is more of a cost of mass production vs user error i still stand by my statement that i do not think they are a shit product they may have some questionable business practices and rebranded overpriced mods but i still feel just fine recommending some of their atomizers at least i have compared them to some of the other well liked attys and i think they can hold their own at their full price probably not the best deal but if you can find some of their gear on sale i say go for it ,3,Waxpen
LouGossetJr,i was always curious about their ti wire because at the time there was no mention of temp control i guess i havent done a lot of reading on their service etc because i guess i have been lucky i have been using their stuff for a long while now and have had great results i have had coils last 3 4 months of daily use around 15w and i get a great pull from it i have not run into a problem with melting insulators or anything like that the only experience i have had has been good they have shipped quickly and my stuff has run good as far as mods go i would never recommend any of the mods that vape companies brand as their own because i vape e liquid too i know damn well that they are repackaged and jacked up in price i really like my sai i feel like i get a smoother hit i just feel like i have to use quite a bit more concentrate for a dose but then again the coil is much larger than the source coils ,2,Waxpen
LouGossetJr,i guess i ahve not seen this side of source but then again i have never had any problems with their products ,3,Waxpen
LouGossetJr,i love my source globe v3 and orb v2 use dual quarts coils i also have the saionara with kanthal black ceramic coil that one is good too but i honestly prefer my globe v3 because i feel like it rips just as good but does not use as much wax as the sai ,3,Waxpen
LouGossetJr,i disagree with this shit i have a sai and a source v3 and to be honest i like the sai but i prefer my source v3 not slim but i think they use same coils i feel like it hits just as well as the sai but i feel like i get more from the product than i do with the sai in other words i pack a lot more wax into the sai than i do in my source for a single dose there too many fanboys in the wax pen sub it almost makes me sick i use the dual quarts coils in my source and the kanthal black ceramic in my sai i can vouch that the source slim bubbler sucks wax clogs the tiny air holes in the bubbler and makes it almost useless after a couple of hits but their orb v2 v3 and globe v3 are very good and ive had no problems using them over the course of about 2 years i understand you may have had problems with your source product but scammers and piece of shit i do not agree ,3,Waxpen

LouGossetJr,so far i am really liking it it did come with the ceramic wick broke tho i noticed a rattle right away and about 1 3rd of the ceramic wick fell out of the twisted kanthal coil it also took forever to get the coil to glow from the center out it had a hot leg on one side and i had to pinch and strum the coil a shit ton of times with ceramic tweezers before it would glow like it should once i got it going i got a nice satisfying draw i actually expected it to hit a little harder i am getting a nice smooth hit and i have taken it up to 28w i know it can probably go higher but i did not really feel the need as i do not really want a harsh hit even with the broken wick it still seems to be using the material pretty well all in all i get a harsher rip from my globe v3 but i am preferring the smoother rip i am getting from the sai i think the smoothness of the sai may have to do with the splash guard i know in my e cig vapes attys with spit back protection tend to be a little less harsh ,1,Waxpen

LouGossetJr,all i know is that back in the day when there were not many options for concentrates i was using the crappy seego vhits and yocan globes and the cannon was the first dual coil atty i ran into on the internet i never heard of source vapes or the orb for another 6 months or so maybe i was not searching good enough anyhow the technology coils nowadays are much better than they were at that time so it kind of a moot point i am sure their current versions are probably pretty comparable ,1,Waxpen
LouGossetJr,i set my father in law up with a source orb v3 and a istick 40w mod he loves it it fairly cheap you will l need a 510 adaptor to use the orb or cannon on a bigger battery or maybe get her a evolve plus it all in one no extra battery needed and they are like 30,1,Waxpen
LouGossetJr,i dunno man i heard of the cannon before i heard of the source orb i have had both the cannon and the orb and both do just fine if you are not a hard core connoiseur i have been using an orb v2 and source globe v3 for about 2yrs and they work great i use mine on a mod tho not an ego style pen the dual coils will barely fire up on my ego battery ,1,Waxpen
LouGossetJr,yes i agree with this ,2,Waxpen
LouGossetJr,i have had good luck with my source orb2 and globe v3 i have been using them for about 2yrs almost every time i have had to replace my coil was due to my user errors i vape too and sometimes forget to turn my wattage down when i switch to my globe and have popped a few coils other than that it worked well i have a sai on the way so i will be able to compare soon ,1,Waxpen

LouGossetJr,i do not think it would be worth the cost difference once you find the wattage you like you do not even have to worry about your coils getting too hot tc can help with flavor a little and let you know when your product is getting low but after you have been doing it a while you can kinda tell by taste and how much vapor your are getting you can tell that you need to add more product almost all of my devices have tc and to be honest i rarely use the tc features ,1,Waxpen

LouGossetJr,yah that bellcap is hard to find these days my goon 22 is pretty generic it was a cheapo i got on ebay for like 11 but it actually very well made and comes with embroidered bag and metal chuf topcap combo and everything but it not a namebrand like smjy or tobecco or anything here that top cap you were probably referring to i think it looks ok but i prefer a more restrictive draw these days and prefer a more narrow bore than that but it has the 510 topcap which is engraved as well imgur http i imgur com c2btrkd jpg ,2,electronic_cigarette
LouGossetJr,i got mine from focalecig com but probably the same as the one on ft i heard those are good as well yah the origen little clone is probably my favorite one of all i have used fdv pins to convert my goon22 clone and narda clone but the newer narda clones come with bf pins goon22 imgur http i imgur com rdbweld jpg narda clone with bellcap imgur http i imgur com bmwxawm jpg split atty clone imgur http i imgur com uriresnl jpg ,2,electronic_cigarette

LouGossetJr,i guess i have been lucky havent run into any bugs i have only had mine for 3 weeks tho i am coming from an lg g3 and i am a pretty big lg fan but i just could not justify the cost to performance ratio compare to the axon7 one of my best friends has a v10 and hates it his battery is shit his bluetooth connection always falling off his headphone dac function is always giving him problems nothing but complaints they may have fixed these issues with the v20 but hard to say the reviews i have watched of the v20 seem like it so so ,2,Axon7

LouGossetJr,i feel like my netflix looks crisp too gotta be better than 480p,1,Axon7
LouGossetJr,i use google play all access and pay 14 99 per month that for the family plan so that for me and i think up to 5 family members there are apps that let you steal music but to me 14 99 per month is a small price to pay to listen to whatever i want whenever i want you can also download up to 2gb or something like that so you can listen while offline ,1,Axon7
LouGossetJr,maybe slightly better but blows away i do not see the v20 blowing the axon7 away in anything ,2,Axon7
LouGossetJr,i went with the axon7 because it 400 cheaper than the v20 the axon7 has a samsung amoled screen but it not super amoled so it is very nice but not quite as colorful as the super amoleds from what i have read it seems the v20 might have the axon beat in the low light cam department and sound recording i guess it depends on how important those features are to you and if they are worth 400 ,2,Axon7
LouGossetJr,that pretty cool i remember when i was in 6th grade i went to a summer camp my counselor was a sr in high school and was a cornerback who went on to be drafted by notre dame and later into the nfl anyhow in the big grass field he wanted to do a foot race with all of the kids we all started at the middle of field and he started at the very end he blew by us so amazingly fast it is still one of the coolest things i have ever seen ,137,sports

LouGossetJr,for me it been a bit of both i have remained friends with some and remain acqaintences with others as far as family members i have remained friendly with them and do miss them from time to time but to be free i had to let them go if i run into them there may be a hug and a short conversation but no other contact as in phone calls or hanging out i guess it will differ for everyone tho and how close you were to the friends and family also will depend on how ugly the divorce was ,2,AskReddit
