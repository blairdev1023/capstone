KubrickIsMyCopilot,it takes a lot of work to build a subreddit a lot of trial and error getting help with css attracting an audience over extended periods of time in fact that could serve as a useful rule only subreddit founders are allowed to ban people because only they know how difficult it is to build a community of your own rather than joining existing ones it a bit absurd that a glorified housekeeper invited to mod after a sub was already big is allowed to destroy a part of someone else social network on a whim ,1,ideasfortheadmins
KubrickIsMyCopilot, you really do not understand reddit specifically and the internet in general if you let idiots like me control your emotions the internet might not be for you that is my honest opinion if you think you are controlling the emotions of people who respond assertively to you then your interpretation of human behavior is badly malfunctioning i am responding because i think there are meaningful things to say when that stops being the case i stop responding if you think of yourself as a troll which is what saying idiots like me sounds like that your prerogative but there are things to say in this conversation whether or not you are the one who benefits from hearing them ,1,LifeProTips

KubrickIsMyCopilot,it a good idea in principle but i think it would be more effective to limit even commenting to subscribers as simple as it is to subscribe that tiny extra amount of effort would deter a lot of spam and divebomb trolling and at least reward the sub a little for its trouble when it happens anyway and with mods in general having less stress maybe the more psychologically fragile among them in large subs would start behaving more responsibly and respectfully toward users it would be a virtuous cycle ,1,ideasfortheadmins

KubrickIsMyCopilot,if op has the skills to build and run their own sub i am sure that an adequate response but let distill this issue down to its essence suppose your phone company decided to start censoring your internet search results and blocking you from talking to half the people on your contacts list for its own financial interests and the personal amusement of the employees doing the censoring suppose you theoretically consented to this because their authority to do it was mentioned in 3 micron high print on page 715 of the contract you signed and suppose all major phone companies have the same practice to one extent or another when you raise concerns about this you are told about an option where you can get a special phone with basically no features that can only talk to a phone that it has been in the physical presence of but no one else and requires that you spend weeks learning how to use it to even become functional which is a metaphor for the slow process of building up your own sub and learning how to run it are your concerns irritation rage at your phone company behavior mitigated by this option ,-1,ideasfortheadmins

KubrickIsMyCopilot, downvoting has been here since literally day one the age of a mistake is not an argument against it being a mistake all of history is ample to confirm that i do not know how you could possibly think it a cancerous tumor on the site downvoting leads to sockpuppetry and brigading so that trolls can silence others and promote their extremist agendas the only way to correct that is when it so egregious and obvious that people report it to admins but there is such a long tail of less obvious cases that it poisons much of what goes on here but what is less obvious from a high level administrator standpoint may be painfully obvious to the people attacked by it and they in turn may be provoked into being less civil as a result or may even be driven to troll in self defense which just multiplies the problem downvoting has a toxic effect on the community a lot of people understand this admins know this they are smart people but they answer to the business side and the money does not appear to care you make it sound like it actually the worst thing in the entire world no it just the worst problem in the user facing architecture of reddit which this sub exists to solicit solutions to maybe make insightful interesting and funny comments in the future and you wo not be so negatively affected by downvotes what you are really saying is do not take substantive positions in highly important but controversial discussions and you wo not be targeted by troll brigades i have lost count of the times i have had to seek admin protection from bot armies that were going after me for things like condemning white supremacist violence and had it confirmed by the admins that that was happening people with less karma to spare and less sense of defiance against bullying would easily be deterred by being targeted like that which is why the underlying source of the problem the downvote system is such a cancer your argument boils down to a appeal to tradition and b victim blaming ,1,ideasfortheadmins

KubrickIsMyCopilot, i think it is silly to believe that basic economic principles would even allow this they not only allow it they are the source of the problem under the outlined conditions as demand in this case the lower classes demands rises people will see a chance to profit by supplying the demanded goods or services demand is not defined in market calculations by how many people want something but by how much money backs the desire if 1000 people with 1 each to spend want x but 1 person with 2 000 to spend wants y and the market has to choose between opportunity costs of serving one or the other the latter qualifies as the higher demand and will be treated as the higher priority however my argument or rather one point of a broader argument is that for a tiny amount of his wealth plantation owner a could supply a pittance to a few of the plantation b beaten subjects to cause a severe hindrance to plantation b supply lines which would make the victim less competitive in the market and result in increased market share and revenue for the aggressor that would be an uncharacteristically subtle tactic for hereditary oligarchs psychologically they grow up not even thinking about the underclasses because they are not part of their household economy or social experience so it rare for people in that category of petty tyrant to make allies of another petty tyrant neglected masses but when it does happen and it has happened in a few cases they rarely succeed for a few reasons while the number of owners is few in an oligarchy there are enough of them to have a social class with its own rules and sense of propriety in dealing with each other to whip up another owner neglected masses against them would violate the social structure that supports the common interests of the oligarchy as a whole so the aggressor however strategic in their choice of people to uplift would be labeled a generalized threat by his peers and depending on how extreme the oligarchy is either shut out or eliminated and if a gambit succeeded anyway they would immediately crush the very people they had uplifted once they were safely in possession of b former property because then the agitation would be costing them rather than their competitors either way the scenario demonstrates that power rather than money becomes the primary concern of the elite once an economy is ultra concentrated they constantly compete for talent resources and privileges only when they have to with a privately owned enterprise at a certain point it stops being a business and becomes a feudatory with its own momentum there are very different behaviors involved someone born into a family of arrogant oligarchs surrounded by sycophants their entire lives would rather have 1 billion and rule like a king than have 10 billion and live like a normal person with more toys bill gates has way more money than the sultan of brunei an absolute ruler do you see the sultan of brunei running off to stanford to get a cs degree so he can start a software company in palo alto he could easily he has more than enough money to fund a competitive business and hire the best talent but he does not give a shit if he wanted to the sultan of brunei or any wealthy absolute ruler anywhere could easily have bill gates assassinated the reverse is not the case ,1,Futurology

KubrickIsMyCopilot,one method for nearby stars is called parallax and it basically just how it moves relative to other stars while earth is moving around the sun this gives rise to a unit of distance you may have heard the parsec this is the distance corresponding to a parallax angle of 1 arcsecond 1 3600th of a degree per year and is a bit over 3 light years long for farther stars a different method is used based on what kind of light comes from certain types of ordinary stars and supernovas called standard candles since we know how these stars work we know what kind of light to expect from them and can thus use what we actually receive as an indication of how far away they are based on how dim the light is this latter method is statistical rather than exact because there are a number of complicating factors but astronomers can establish upper and lower limits on the distance using that and other factors eg comparing to other stars around it that have likewise been calculated the short answer is that for most stars we do not know how far they are for certain we just have reasonable theories ,3,explainlikeimfive

KubrickIsMyCopilot,there no reason there would be equivalent population densities the states were founded at different times under different circumstances by different demographics have different resources and climates and grew or did not based on different economic conditions in their respective regions in relation to the country as a whole the northeast is very dense because it a more or less the oldest part of the country b was the most economically active throughout most of american history c was the arrival point for most immigrants in most eras and d was influenced by the close quarters urban design of northern european cities that were built centuries before the midwest is much more distributed and sprawling because the land is flat and agriculturally rich over a broad swath of territory so settlers moving west could basically just pick a spot they found convenient and set up a town but because rivers are very helpful to agriculture the population tended to congregate somewhat more around the mississippi and its feeder rivers in the north also along the great lakes coasts accessible from the northeast for industrial reasons the midwest sprawled even more when automobiles came around so you could just set up shop pretty much anywhere on the plains with highway access and it was fine the south was economically crippled by slavery driven agriculture which kept its economy and population relatively rural and meant that not much investment went into the growth of cities railroads and factories because slaves were available immigrant labor was not in high demand so there was not the constant infusion of new culture and opportunity that the northeast experienced with the exception of the relatively mild mid atlantic south the climate of the south is also very hot and humid with tropical and similar diseases being more of a feature so not necessarily attractive based on people descriptions in say a 19th century boston newspaper compared to ohio michigan etc only with the advent of the automobile the electrification programs of the fdr administration and especially air conditioning did the southern population begin growing a lot the west did not start growing in a major way until the 20th century for similar reasons it very hard to live in the rocky mountains without modern amenities very rough terrain hard to grow things and difficult to connect economically with other parts of the country and the desert regions were just awful without air conditioning and major water infrastructure it was for people who were brave or desperate hence all the wild west stories with the transcontinental railroad people would pass through these areas to get to northern california oregon and washington which definitely were nice places in terms of climate and agriculture but because the west coast started so much later the population did not explode until the 20th century and people did not start migrating back inland into the deserts and mountains until even later places like montana wyoming etc still have low populations because nothing ever brought a lot of people there in the first place there were a lot easier places on the plains than the flatland parts of those states a lot easier places in the rockies to the south than the mountainous parts there was nothing to the north yet for a long time so it isolated on all sides and it at a geographic extreme where it was not useful even just to pass through parts are beautiful so there is some tourism but beyond that there was just no reason to settle there ,9,explainlikeimfive

KubrickIsMyCopilot,planets form out of clouds of gas and dust that are already spinning around their common center of mass where the star forms the planets keep the momentum of the cloud they formed out of so if there were no gravity pulling them inward they would fly off in a straight line tangent to their orbit but because gravity is pulling on them from the star their motion is constantly bent into an orbit rather than being a straight line off into space if you magically stopped their linear motion along the orbit then gravity would pull them straight into the star but sometimes objects do fall into a star because of that especially in early stages of a solar system formation when there still a lot of gas and dust running into that gas and dust can slow an object down in its orbit and cause it to spiral inward if it very close to the star or not that big ,1,explainlikeimfive

KubrickIsMyCopilot, funnily enough spartan society let much more place to women than other greek cities spartan women had more options because spartan men were forced by law to focus most of their effort on physical and military training and because of that bizarre thing about legally compulsory homosexuality which meant men took less interest overall in what women did or did not do as long as they bore children and were sufficiently brutal in raising them the overly famous slaughter of babies was far less common than what we usually hear they were believed to take exposure to further extremes than their contemporaries others would abandon babies that were clearly deformed or sickly but spartans supposedly were taught to have a standard of perfection to dispose of a baby if they did not consider it beautiful or active enough to judge it like a crop basically which is indistinguishable from nazi ideology and apart from the helot thing i do not really see where the murder culture is present not to be dismissive of your point but that is a bit like saying apart from jews and gypsies i do not see where nazism was a murder cult helots were the designated scapegoat they were hunted for sport like animals ritualistically tortured and murdered just as a way to acculturate young spartans to the acts of torture and murder and periodically purged in substantial numbers for any political reason that came about the thing about a narcissist political cult like nazism or sparta ideology is that it would treat designated scapegoats totally differently from societies that it respected or had no opinion about compare nazi behavior in occupied france to how it behaved in poland ukraine and russia it was radically different and for no deeper reason than that germans felt kinship to the french while seeing slavic peoples as inferior beings and also sparta was notably during most of its history pretty fair to its allies taking counsel with them and not forcing them by enforcing its dominion like athens did with the delian league sparta was a conservative inward looking state whose prime motive was always the long term survival and stability of the spartan way of life so that is a legitimate distinction with nazism which was partly rooted in an ideology of revenge for imagined grievances and was relatively unstable because it came about by toppling an elective republic sparta roots were always deeply authoritarian and evolved into proto totalitarianism rather than becoming that way through a rapid series of traumatic events like germany experienced the reason it was not so much an expansionist society was that focus on stability which is more analogous to the 20th century communist states rather than nazi germany so no analogy can be perfect across such gulfs of time they were basically a bizarre cult town that became militarily powerful to protect the cult yes you can argue its policies were usually defensive but that became otherwise when it turned into a battle of ideologies with the democratic states or at least when the excuse for athenian greed became overthrowing tyrannies and oligarchies this is a bit interpretive here but from the way it looks the minute they felt judged that cult narcissism was triggered and sparta very much decided that democracies could not be tolerated even in a subordinate capacity they decided that democracy was a plague that had to be eradicated because the athenians were using the liberation of slaves and democratization of oligarchic states as war tactics and the combination of that attitude and athenian greed creating enemies of even other democracies is what led ultimately to the death of greek democracy ,1,history

KubrickIsMyCopilot, sparta was widely admired by contemporaries as being the embodiment of what it meant to be good greeks in the conservative way spartan armies were admired for their discipline and ferocity but their domestic society was too closed to be much of a subject in other city states they only showed what they wanted to show and what peaked through that they did not want to show was regarded as disturbing and shady the ritualized sadism the legally mandated not merely permitted pedophilia the compulsive secrecy etc laconic speech for instance was often attributed by outsiders to self possession and discipline because it was observed among visiting athletes and dignitaries but arguably it probably resulted from the need to keep their mouths shut because of the opaque and treacherous politics of an absolute oligarchy that kind of speech pattern evolves among people who grow up in environments where letting another person know your thoughts is dangerous north koreans speak laconically while south koreans do not if we look at the past through contemporay moral glasses we will only see sadism murder rape and so forth but even by horizontal comparison sparta was objectively organized on the specific moralization of sadism and murder other oligarchies were violent but violence outside of warfare was by and large just something that happened by default not the essence of their value system an athenian could be a sadistic animal but he was not taught by his society that such behavior was the essence of virtue they were taught to be philosophic or at least rich people were while in a very real way spartans were taught to be misosophic to silence their thoughts with thought terminating cliches this is why sparta is the prototype for nazi germany yes other european dictatorships and monarchies conducted racist murder sprees segregated and purged minorities waged brutal wars etc etc but these activities were not the basis of their entire ethos they were side effects of brutal individuals ruling states that did not control them but murder and tyranny were the central ethos of nazism and in ancient times was the central ethos of sparta athenian brutality was much more banal they were drunk on the unprecedented wealth and splendor of their society and just wanted more the debates recorded by thucydides about the proposed invasion of syracuse are almost comically gangsterish like basically we have got this awesome navy let go rob people it was fucked up but it was relatable to the ordinary human condition the spartan way of thinking was something much more bizarre and perverted it was very much the kind of mentality that would not be adequately described until the book 1984 in sparta the purpose of torture was torture the purpose of murder was murder the purpose of war was war the infliction of suffering had for whatever reason been elevated to the status of something to be eagerly sought as its own purpose who knows how that happened maybe their politics was just so efficiently oppressive that this was their only outlet and that turned into the entire purpose of their society edit additional thoughts the more i think about it the more justified i find the connection to nazism to be sparta had a designated scapegoat population the helots that it held captive in perpetuity and unleashed all of its sadism on and went far beyond a normal ancient enslavement type of institution they did not merely force them to work and take the benefits they used them as target practice and periodically hunted them used them as ritual murder subjects in their youth rites of passage on and on and while they were doing this they projected an idealized image of themselves to the outside greek world this is classic narcissism and describes the nature of the nazis to a tee not to mention the whole obsession with purity and annihilating what they considered impure from themselves ,22,history

KubrickIsMyCopilot, it is literally impossible to say the roots of anti abortion are 100 religious and misogynistic there are no absolutes i am unaware of any other basis for the anti abortion position despite decades of familiarity with and debates on the issue so i am comfortable asserting in the absence of information to the contrary that religion and or misogyny are the sole motives it comes down to whether you consider a developing fetus to be a living human or not if we are to address it with consistency then it comes down to whether you define the ethical value of a human by dna or by the capacity of an entire organism for consciousness science acknowledges the latter but ethical consistency is exceedingly rare on the anti abortion side and tends to be limited basically to liberal popes who also preach against capital punishment war torture cruelty to animals shooting people for trespassing on your property and nearly everything else that conservatives tend to consider their inherent prerogative people who oppose capital punishment inherently volunteer to pay whatever taxes are necessary to support lifer prisoners but the same cannot be said with respect to anti abortion people and the additional population they demand to create they are overwhelmingly small government conservatives small except for militaries prisons and regulating female anatomy and yet do not want to pay for any of it they want to punish women whose lives do not conform to their beliefs period and stop caring the instant the magic macguffin ie fetus is born and needs food stamps ,1,todayilearned

KubrickIsMyCopilot, because the key way manufacturing plants achieve efficiencies is by specialization specialization within the black box the bigger the box ie the more of the production process is included within the optimized system the more general its output specialization external to the black box leads to distributed supply chains and the change resistant corporate environment i mention such a system maximizes profit within current technology but makes additional technological advance more difficult as for the idea of targeting the ideal factory and not just winning over competitors well historically many cases not thinking this way has stalled progress even with the case of moore law which is a nice way to coordinate the pace of industry instead of aiming towards the ideal goal and which may have stalled the industry so this idea might work musk describes it as paraphrasing thinking from first principles rather than by analogy iow you are competing with absolute physical limits not with other businesses it a more technical version of the athlete aphorism about focusing on pursuing your own best rather than trying to exceed someone else standard but such project are very risky require tons of capital and offer less opportunities for learning than a slow measured pace definitely risky and capital intensive which is why there such a wide valley of death between innovative small business and big business also why innovative sb that graduate to bb generally stop being innovative they were using innovation just as a tactic to gain market share rather than as their central organizing principle they still use the word innovate but it comes to mean incremental tweaks to squeeze every last penny out of sunk investment rather than continuous fundamental advance that mba oriented management regards as disruptive to the company own functioning costly compromises have to be made up front during vulnerable early years that allow for drastic evolution later on making such an attempt even more likely to fail but hopefully the successes that musk is piling up are being studied by business professionals and scholars to advance the culture as a whole as to having less opportunities for learning i think this may be why tesla open sources its patents a highly integrated vertical company is very opaque unless an effort is made to teach the rest of the industry and bring it along and another way this happens is by the experiences of former employees who bring their insights elsewhere including to new companies they create so you need to be very careful about making the right decisions yes the ability to avoid sunk cost fallacy is essential in a vertically integrated system the inertia of what musk is building would send it over a cliff if it made decisions the way that big bureaucratic corporations do tesla and spacex constantly try things constantly dart and vibrate in various directions and abandon or back burner what does not work or is not ready the dynamism makes a very high stress working environment to all accounts but it works wonders so one wonder how do we enable more people companies to work at that level i think musk has already told the industry what it needs to know do not limit yourself by how other people do or have done things just look at the laws of physics and figure out what you can do with what you have if you want to achieve something more than making money there no secret lower cost and or faster output can eventually provide profit as a positive side effect anyway so focus on whatever mix of those innovations most enables continued advancement if you just focus on profit you will end up avoiding progress at a certain point in order to maximize short term roi on achievements already made so consciously avoid that backward thinking climb the steepest faces of the highest mountains because all progress there makes everything else easier ,1,Futurology

KubrickIsMyCopilot,most deviations between spelling and pronunciation in english are a result of french and german vocabulary which also deviate a lot between spelling and pronunciation among their respective speakers that was a result of two things a romans writing germanic languages in latin characters in the early middle ages which were then adopted by those cultures and b normal drift in pronunciation over time which in some cases nobody bothered to change the spellings of another cause is the vast number of loan words in english from languages all over the world an example would be tsunami a japanese word where the t is not silent in japanese the ts sound is one distinct sound not an awkward combination of two but that sound does not exist at the beginning of english words it exists at the ends as in bits so english speakers just drop the t an say it as if it were sunami the main reason archaic spellings tend not to be corrected is because the vast majority of native english speakers live in a country that does not have an official language the united states and does not care enough to create uniform linguistic policies the way that some countries do other english speaking countries including great britain tend to retain archaic spellings as a matter of tradition ,1,explainlikeimfive
