22jam22,u know what i think was a huge spurs mistake was letting speedy claxton go he basicaly won a championship for us when parker was playing horrible and he was perfect back up for spurs when he left he didnt do shit anyways i think less of learinf from chris paul more of practicing day in and day out against one of the smartest dirtiest players in nba history would speed the process up my two cents but you make valid points i have this feeling after the destruction of cavs some stars are going to team up i could see paul george going to boston my friend gave a very scary trade possiblity clay thompson for mason plumlee one of there young pgs and their first round i think gsw would win 73 games again or more ,2,NBASpurs
22jam22,i think the reason we need him is we are asking to much of kawhi he is not a natural passer he will get better but why not let cp3 make everybodies job easier i wish we coukd keep dedmond because he would be natural fit for pick and roll dunks and this is the biggest thing i think cp3 would help aldridge aldridge cant post any more some reason but cp3 will get him the ball at the right place at the right time and i want dejonte to learn from the best everyday in oractice till he is ready life time san antonio native so not some invader or what ever u were talking about ,3,NBASpurs
22jam22,of course draymond would be so good as a spur we would have the best defense ever and he is a great passer and can knock down open threes if we had him instead of aldridge the spurs would have won 70 games this season but u are right his antics and attitude are not very spur like,2,NBASpurs

22jam22,id say more along the human rights area so let this be my final question because im notbdisagreeing with your points they pretty much made sense is new about gays represented in the media more then their actual numbers in society if you think its under represented ok is it about right or is there more stuff concerning gay issues on tv and internet and magazines then there probably should be ,0,pics
22jam22,well the fact that each weekend a large amount of blacks are shot and killed in numerous cities and you dont here very much at all and that church shooting was a pretty long time ago i think he was sentenced recently ,1,pics

22jam22,i might be naive but the only place i see openly anti gay stance is russia and muslim countries i live in a some what conservative town and i do not see or hear anybody talking about gays in a negative way of all my friends and i know alot of people id say i am the only one that complains about gays and i only lightly complain like why they in the media so much it seems ludacris for some one to actualy go out and beat some one up because they are gay thats the world i live in but i guess it is out there a lot worse then imagine and we need it as front line news on a daily basis just think if 900 gays were killed in chicago last year and a gay night club was shot up and 12 gays were shot like it just happend insert gay instead of african american what would happen then ,1,pics
22jam22,i live in a historic district that is an art district basicaly heavily populated by gay people i live with them deal with them when ever i go out and about and i have no issues with it i gave up on watching tv news do not read newspapers and try to avoid the media in general these days but i am on reddit a decent amount which could be one reason i see more gay stuff then the average person in america ,1,pics

22jam22,i think it has gone over board my point is that its overblown now if some one is discriminating against gays its going to ruin that persons life not the gay persons i mean someones livelyhood was ended because they would not make a gay cake are you kidding me just tired of seeing it every day on every other headline and every sitcom has a gay character is it being represented or over represented at this point ,0,pics
22jam22,true it really is not affecting me but this is my analogy for you if 900 gays were killed in chicago last year would it be front line news every day of the entire year last year my basic question is why does a small minority of peolple command so much media attention not one person even attempted to answer my question ohh while im at it google south african genocide and see if thats ever in the media ya do not think it is the afrikanars need to all come out as gay then the world would start caring about their situation ,0,pics
22jam22,if i wore a maga hat i could possibly be beaten none of you answered the question you just pointed out how on a daily basis there is a massive amount of gay bashing going on im never said i do not care about gay people getting beat it just that i care about any humans getting beat and i do not care what their relgion is or the color of their skin can you imagine if 800 gays were killed in chicago last year what would the head lines be not to mention all the gays being killed in memphis baltimore cincinatti the list can go on and on ignore spelling and grammar mistakes from my phone you get the point why is a very small percentage of the population taking up so much media space thats my question i never said beating gays was ok its not i would say obviously no if there is a small amount of people that in now way should make them a target i mean look how many amish related crimes are commited against them as a minority your arguments are not valid and never addressed my real question i have no issues with them holding hands i do not care if they really were gay and holding hands ,-2,pics
