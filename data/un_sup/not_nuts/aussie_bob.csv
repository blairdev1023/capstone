aussie_bob,it not really a battery replacement more a competitor for molten salt solar energy storage the afr story is big on hype but low on details but 1414 own pr says the market for energy storage systems is vast but most technologies address the requirements for small localised storage such as homes with solar cells these are expensive and will be used by those who want to invest in going off grid or need backup for energy security they are typically much less than 1 megawatt hour 1 mwh with some commercial installations of up to 5mwh at the other end of the scale pumped hydro is the most efficient for the large capacity energy storage but there are limited locations worldwide and few in australia these are unlikely to be economically viable or environmentally acceptable to current sentiment our technology is suited to the middle of the capacity scale where there are few viable technologies and none are yet commercial a crucial requirement for success of larger scale storage is it be economical and our products will cost about 10 times less than batteries at the scales we have chosen another advantage of the 1414 degrees products is scalability to meet differing requirements accordingly we decided on a modular approach allowing us to service markets ranging from district heating farms or factories to city grids and wind farms requiring gigawatt hours the two modules have storage capacities of 10mwh tessind and 200mwh tessgrid with scalable energy recovery technology so comparisons with powerwall are hyperbole this is municipal scale or larger storage ,13,australia

aussie_bob,the blackouts were caused because aemo which operates most of australia s gas and electricity markets runs the electricity system like a stock market they forced load shedding instead of starting up both of the pelican point gas generators because starting up the second turbine would have cost engie more than they would have earned over the time it was running the publicity on wednesday forced them to change their mind and the turbine was contributing on thursday night when identical conditions did not result in the same blackouts tldr the energy market operator is structured to prioritise short term profits for a private company instead of energy security for an entire state ,58,australia

aussie_bob,the pics look similar to mine though i would probably take it a bit past more oil and lemon juice where that one is to make it creamier that looks like about one and a half to two x oil to garlic ratio if you are getting a good emulsion but not as chunky as you would like you could add more garlic and salt after the emulsion is stable you could even process some garlic separately and just fold it in i live in western australia but have not had to manage heat the stop start process probably helps with that ,1,AskCulinary
aussie_bob,two things technique matters when you are using a food processor and it easier to make a lot of toum than a little which is why imitating the restaurant version may be hard for what it worth my version generally has the texture of dense whipped cream the ingredients are lemon juice salt garlic oil i use sunflower but most vegetable oils will work ratios are 1 tablespoon of salt to 1 cup of whole garlic cloves about 1 2 cup of lemon juice and 3 4 cups of oil get good fresh local garlic the irradated long life chinese ones do not emulsify as well start with the salt and garlic cloves and pulse then scrape the sides a few times until the garlic is even but still a bit chunky run the food processor and very slowly pour in about 1 2 a cup of oil making sure it fully mixed then add a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice again making sure it all incorporated keep doing the oil lemon juice blending until it emulsifies normally after the third or fourth half cup but depends on the garlic if it has not split by then you have done it slowly enough and you can gradually drizzle in the rest of the lemon juice to taste it will likely take at least 10 minutes if it has split you cannot get it back so add egg white and make aioli or mustard and herbs for salad dressing ,2,AskCulinary

aussie_bob,you are not far off what happened here a great explanation by u magictoast9 from when this was posted a few years ago context ryan crowley purple fremantle plays the role of a tagger for fremantle this role involves playing against one player for all of the majority of the match with the intention of limiting their influence on the game thereby relieving the pressure on his team as well as providing a bit more freedom to his team players crowley is also the best in the business at this role players who get the tag from crowley generally do not have good games steve johnson white navy stripe geelong is a midfielder forward who is very very good and was having a huge impact early in this game kicking 2 goals and having 12 disposals in the first quarter average disposals for good players is around 25 per game crowley went to johnson late in the first quarter and from then on johnson managed only 8 disposals for the remainder of the match and did not kick any more goals after being behind at the end of the first quarter fremantle went on to win this game despite geelong being heavy favourites tagging is a controversial tactic in the afl generating a lot of anger although typically from the player getting tagged crowley is widely renowned as being a fair player and always tries to end the match on good terms with a handshake in this case johnson is pretty bitter about being beaten as you can see tldr crowley beat johnson well and johnson team lost johnson bitter np reddit com r gifs comments 1m176r shaking hands in australia cc4ub0j ,27,funny
