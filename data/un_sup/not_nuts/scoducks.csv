scoducks,the act of trying to put the counter on is what untaps it the card does not say when this creature gets a 1 1 counter untap it so it triggers the untap even if the counter does not land ,5,magicTCG

scoducks,except cosmetic items are not in any way an advantage the only thing from a loot box that could be called an advantage is getting heroes but veteran players will almost by definition have more heroes unlocked than new players ,3,heroesofthestorm

scoducks,after i have already been bringing in the card advantage for 3 turns before turn 8 i have probably already won but if i have not i am happy to keep you from being able to hold up any kind of instant speed tricks for my turn also i am not saying this card is good against every deck but i could see myself siding it in against control that wants to have those instants to play on my turn ,0,magicTCG
scoducks,true but you had specifically mentioned standard so i thought i should make sure you were aware of the upcoming rotation ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,you give it to them after you have removed all the counters thus making their maximum hand size zero ,1,magicTCG

scoducks,you cannot use their reflector mage to bounce their own creature because card specifies that an opponent must control the creature being bounced also if you bounce the emrakul you can replay her on your next turn if they do it you cannot ,2,magicTCG
scoducks,let kt and li ming through to the other team they picked both of them of course and proceeded to get stomped the players were clearly inexperienced with them and only picked them to avoid putting their team on tilt i am sure once kt died for the 5th time his team was all caps gg ing raging at the worst kt ever what i am saying is the pick is only suboptimal if you know how to play them well and do not chose to of course i am only mid gold tier so what do i know right ,2,heroesofthestorm
scoducks,the player has the option to cast the card when spell queller leaves the battlefield see the similar wording on the recent brain in a jar that lets you cast sorceries whenever it taps the player is given non normal ability to cast whatever spell spell queller exiled when the spell queller leaves the battlefield ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,the ability allows for your opponent to cast normally sorcery speed things at pseudo instant speed so the card is not as good as you may have thought ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,this happens to me in 75 of my games on cursed hollow i simply do not understand how people can seriously not understand the map to that extent and it is not always just people saying gg i had a diablo start feeding after we lost the first tribute largely due to him staying in lane too long and completely throwing the game ,14,heroesofthestorm
scoducks,i am not saying good story telling cannot have death and destruction i am saying if wizards is looking for a long term basis for story telling then the gatewatch has to win at the start i am also saying people on reddit will be mad no matter what but that practically part of the tos at this point ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,lots of people in this thread saying something to the effect of they just show up and win like killing titans is easy stupid wizards do not know how to tell a story so let me propose an alternate that people would probably hate for nearly the same reasons in fall 2016 ulamog and kozilek return to zendikar the plane is toast after the gatewatch fail to save it in january 2016 fan response what the hell why introduce a group of wannabe superheroes who cannot save anything stupid wizards do not know how to tell a story in april 2016 a defeated sad jace ends up trying to solve a mystery on innistrad by july it clear that emrakul is about to mess stuff up and the art book spoils that despite lilliana joining the fan hated jacetice league emrakul drives the plane mad and watches it practically destroy itself fan response oh my god wizards why do i have to read about a story that is just so lame the good guys should win this whole eldrazi are the ultimate evil thing is crap i wa not to see nicol bolas or garruk or something i am tired of reading about this same enemy if you want to make it interesting and get me to care then they need to actually do something for once tl dr people seem to dislike the forced nature of the gatewatch and specifically people seem to hate how easy it seems but imagine a world where they lost we would hate how weak the heroes are and we would be tired of reading about eldrazi destroying stuff instead of calling out to get the real heroes back we would be looking for more interesting villains which to be fair a few people are already saying ,1,magicTCG

scoducks, the athletes on scholarships have to maintain their sport performance and academics and they are competing at very high levels maintain their sport performance and academics academics ncaa athletes cannot take one online class and get a full ride nor can an nfl linebacker decide to go back to school and play for a college team that the issue here pro players getting put on a team with low class loads makes it appear as though they are a ringer brought in to secure the win and not a legitimate college student with exceptional skill training and dedication get it also ncaa rules allow for the equivalent of up to 407 full ride scholarships to be offered per school at the d i level with limitations by sport gender and total number of students there are 347 d i schools in the us so each year ncaa d i schools alone can offer up to 141 229 full rides now obviously not every d i school has every sport i am just pointing out that even at the highest collegiate level there are a lot of scholarships most especially because these only count scholarships given based on athletics student athletes who also excel in the classroom are eligible for funding from additional sources without violating ncaa rules sources http www scholarshipstats com ncaalimits html http www ncaa org championships statistics division d1 edit fixed some typos,2,heroesofthestorm
scoducks, also costs do not depend on the number of courses you take it just changes your status as a part time or full time student the fact that you call it university makes me think you are not from the america if you are not from the us then your government probably supports education well in the us you pay based on credits literally thousands of dollars more per class at most major universities so your line that i quoted is just wrong for our terrible system just wanted to spread that knowledge as i am on the side of students only being allowed to compete in heroes of the dorm if they are full time students not this 1 class nonsense that happening now ,1,heroesofthestorm
scoducks,i think the real issue here is that in order to compete in ncaa athletics there are requirements for enrollment gpa etc on these athletes you are talking about but there is no such requirement for this huge scholarship opportunity that and your tone comes off as upset and bit condescending basically your argument would be like saying student athletes have to go on to be pro athletes in order to earn a scholarship and that simply is not the case sure student athletes are generally very talented and dedicate a lot of time to their sport but this idea you have that scholarships are only available to olympic professional caliber athletes is to be blunt wrong so being wrong coupled with your tone is what is getting you downvoted and to make it clear i do see your point i just think your idea of a athletic scholarship availability and b how much time the average joe heroes player puts in overnight really are off base edit fixed a couple obvious typos ,0,heroesofthestorm

scoducks,ya my point was just that this card is not still amazing with madness because it does not allow you to pay the madness cost because it is not being discarded the rest of what you said is true but only if you are not talking about standard with regards to delve which is why i only said something about madness ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,madness only works if you discard a card this will just put it into your graveyard which is a different thing so madness does not apply ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,i like the humility in this post that is this is a terrifically succinct yet clear graphic for all the color combos and you did not label it as the greatest thing ever good work ,12,magicTCG

scoducks,i am not usually one for all the chen hate but that pretty funny ,20,heroesofthestorm
scoducks,i think what other replies have missed is this use the numbered dice as you might use op reminders ie cross them off as you use them i do not have a deck featuring demonic pact although i did just pull one at fnm but i would put four dice out when it entered the battlefield and then switch each die 6 when i used that mode a 1 would be the drain life a 2 would be discard a 3 for draw and the 4 for losing the game right before having to lose the game it would look like 6664 which hits both western and chinese omens of demons death which i kinda like not enough to make and play the deck but i still like it ,2,magicTCG

scoducks,it can put your opponent dragonlord atarka into his her graveyard while still doing some other form of shenanigans which is not terrible ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,so i think your math is off here due to an order of operations error if you are using lands 0 4 mana 1 with mana including the single green and thus the 1 is to account for that single green not being able to put a land into play then your should have used lands 0 4 mana 1 which changes your equation around to mana lands 2 5 1 and your examples would read so to get 2 lands you would need on average mana 2 2 5 1 6 which brings the curve down significantly but ultimately this spell is dependent on a lot of variables mostly lands left and cards left but also available mana and would likely be best accomplished using dependent probability https www khanacademy org math precalculus prob comb dependent events precalc v introduction to dependent probability ,2,magicTCG

scoducks,it says another red source so i do not think this counts itself ,14,magicTCG
scoducks,hence the ability ,2,magicTCG
scoducks,a big thing i see in the comments is the financial differences of the formats which for me boils down to this is mtg an investment or a hobby if i viewed it as an investment i would play modern but i do not i see mtg as a hobby so i play standard i spend 20 30 to build and tweak a deck that does decently at fnm and have some fun over a couple months i also play table top at home with weird decks i throw together just for fun from all the leftovers from boosters so we call it 50 for several months of entertainment and fun i know people who spend more than that going to a single concert as their form of entertainment people who take standard seriously spend a lot more and then those cards depreciate in value so they lose money i would say that is not a reason not to play the format just a way to frame it magic is fun so play the format you like and have fun with it edit fixed a couple glaring typos ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,good i see a lot of people in various comments assuming this ability maxes out at 4 but i do not believe it does while the 6 mill with this will be extremely rare i still think it will be fun when it happens ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,question for you did you consider the chance that this card re triggers twice or more ie mills for 6 or can this only re trigger once i have seen different assumptions being used but not direct answer to this question ,1,magicTCG
scoducks,when it say repeat this process that means it mills until they get a land or a mismatched pair of cards right i see a lot of comments saying it mills 2 or 4 but i think it could potentially mill more is that wrong ,1,magicTCG

scoducks,everyone living in a culture with slavery is not a horrible person at least i would not think that a very fair assessment ,8,WoT
scoducks,ah i see i think then that the problem is not so much the gun balance as the skill balance that means you and the other people who got the game early usually at additional cost are better than the average cod player so you do not miss every other shot so the guns seem overpowered or at least maybe that it ,3,blackops2
scoducks,by that logic you should recognize that hiddengem has his own opinion that you are overreacting ,3,blackops2

scoducks,i could omit the first comma but having it is not grammatically incorrect and i am sure you know that ellipsis indicate longer pauses which was my intent replacing them with commas would change how i meant the comment to be read i meant it to be read as a condescending remark on denver dan80 misuse and misunderstanding of percentages the long pauses that ellipsis convey should make clear the slow nature in which i feel math has to be explained to grammar nazis such as yourself ,-2,blackops2
scoducks,but if perks and guns get interesting you end up with op perks and guns so i think you mean the game is balanced not too balanced ,1,blackops2
scoducks, the game is too balanced excuse me but what does that even mean seems like a bit of an oxymoron to me ,2,blackops2
scoducks,so are you saying that you think they are the same as mw3 then because 100 times better is the same 100 better would be twice as good and 100 times better would be 9900 better basically what i am saying is your math is either off or you do not think the maps are better which is it ,-10,blackops2
scoducks,this is correct as far as the info currently available as in the percentage might get tweaked but for 100 hardline increases the score you get it does not decrease the score you need example for the math behind that somewhat subtle difference lets say a score streak costs 1000 points and each kill gives you 100 score if hardline reduced the cost by 20 you would need 800 points or 8 kills to earn the streak with how hardline is set up you get 120 points for a kill meaning 8 kills only gets you 960 points so you would need a couple assists or another kill to earn that streak ,2,blackops2

scoducks,agreed with all points above just wanted to add that i feel like i remember seeing a capture assist in one of the gamescom videos someone who was killed while capping got points because his team still got the capture i am not 100 on this but i think that this is definitely a point that treyarch has considered the point being rewarding players for aiding in the capture but not actually getting the capture ,1,blackops2
scoducks,i would disagree the solution to uav is to shoot them down not to nerf them if one or two people on a team play more of a support style with a non noobtube launcher then uav should not be able to show the team more than a couple times they are not over power because they have easy non ghost counters that somebody on a team is bound to have i know i always carry a launcher and bo2 scorestreaks will give me even more incentive to carry one ,6,blackops2

scoducks,that the thing we do not know that shock charges will only kill if the enemy has low health we just hope so ,1,blackops2
scoducks,source just to end this question i am hoping he was weak but i do not know of any proof one way or the other ,1,blackops2
scoducks,agreed although it does kind of make sense that it would do damage then shock the player to death but still makes the combat axe seem kinda pointless ,2,blackops2

scoducks,while having two secondaries as an option should exist just because they have been throwing around these numbers does not actually mean they have as many options as people may think take the perks for instance three categories two with 5 one with 6 for all of them you can pick no perks in 1 way you can pick 1 perk in 5 ways for the first two tiers and 6 for the third and you can pick two perks from one of the first tiers without order mattering because it does not in 10 ways 5 choose 2 and the third tier in 15 6 choose 2 this means tiers 1 2 each have 16 possible combinations tier 3 has 22 16x16x22 5632 different classes just based on perks that why its hard for me to get excited when they say there tens of thousands of different classes you could play with that number easy to get big i am excited to see how well they pull it all together though hopefully the little things that people assume are there will be edit typos ,10,blackops2
scoducks,mostly this the idea is to end kill whoring and start getting people to play the game if you cap a point 150 get 2 kills defending that point you are at 350 and you have your uav sure if you try to boost your k d it will take 6 kills but playing the objective is the idea and i would agree about treyarch needing to be careful about the double points thing i believe vahn addressed this when talking about the tweaking the devs were still going to do meaning they will look at how things played out at gamescom and adjust things accordingly edit just to be clear i said mostly this because i we giving some details to the op so he she can think about the gameplay that goes along with this new system ie k d is no longer king its w l ,2,blackops2

scoducks,oh yeah i agree i would like it to be something like this when it comes to unlocks first unlock create a class at level 1 why force me to use classes that do not fit my play style when we have this new pick 10 system second when you give me a gun give me all the attachments because why not why do i have to play with a gun for a dozen matches before i can have the sight i like does not make sense last no unlocking scorestreaks either i guess that another thing to work for but really its just frustrating to realize hey i have been playing a lot of ctf i think using a guardian would be good to help my team oh wait i unlocked the swarm instead guess i wo not be helping my team out as much as i could be til i level 5 more times so basically what i am saying is this leveling and unlocking things is fun but making it too much work or having it affect the way i can play the game is just nonsense especially with whole pick 10 system so hopefully pick 10 changes some or these things for us ,2,blackops2
scoducks,while i agree it should not be a grind i also think that part of the fun is leveling up so if they come too fast and easy it kinda takes a bit of the fun out of it for me you know gotta have balance i guess ,1,blackops2

scoducks,agreed problem is i only know a few people who play so usually i am the only guy with a mic and saying sniper up top of x or guy camped at y does not actually help modes like domination and ctf are the best when you have good teammates good being they talk and play the objective but the only guys with mics seem to be kill whores who only have mics so they can trash talk but league matches should change all that i hope ,2,blackops2
scoducks, your empirical data is bullshit your games were fine then you see videos of others and think most of their games are fine that not data no the data would be most of my games are fine while i am online there usually between 40 and 60 thousand people online world wide unless you want me to assume that most of those people are playing a game that is absolutely no fun for them due to lag comp them i am going to assume at least let call it 35 000 people have the same experience as me daily show me 35 000 people who have your experience you cannot find them well that because they are the minority by a lot so most people games are fine most of the time i am not saying its perfect nor am i trying to discredit what other people are experiencing as you mentioned you do not have problems on black ops others have and that sucks for them but do you think that treyarch should redo their matchmaking to fit those people no why that are you a giant dirty asshole for not promoting the improvement of their experience no am i one for trying to explain that lag comp has to happen that not everyone or even a majority has these problems with mw3 lag comp and that fixing it for your group will probably cause problems for another apparently i am sorry you paid your 60 and cannot enjoy it i really am but because you got screwed does not mean the game is broken it means you got screwed and probably should not give infinity ward your money next time around ,0,blackops2
scoducks,i get the feeling that you are not really catching my point which is not that lag comp is mythical but that lag comp does not ruin the game for everyone which is what other people are saying hopefully directly responding to some of your points will help make what i am saying clear yes the internet is incredible and yeah lag happens but this is not an issue with lag it is an issue with lag compensation play black ops and you will not see this happen even with lag play mw3 with a fiber connection and people will be rubber banding shooting you before you even see them etc etc again it is not an issue with the game being laggy it is with the lag compensation thank you for quoting me and making it out like i am talking about lag i am talking about how lag happens therefore lag compensation has to exist now moving it was done to try to combat the host problem so yeah you might have a different game experience play black ops that how these people want it to be if they fixed it it would be like that it like if you were playing street fighter and player1 only gets half of his life bar because he hosting the game if he did get a full bar yeah your game experience would be different but why does that make yours better than his awful comparison first off the terrible problems with lag lag comp happens because you are playing with up to 17 other people 1v1 games have much less of an issue with this second if you just started out wounded that would be an completely different situation from what we are talking about if you had the drop on a player you would still kill him her because you hits would register other player would die that it instead the problem is the game does not recognize you shooting and killing the other player and lastly i am just not sure what your question here if he did get a full bar yeah your game experience would be different but why does that make yours better than his is talking about so maybe i would get a better idea of your analogy if you explained anyway next point and this is the big point that nobody is getting here so i will tie it to your intro they programmed the compensation code into their game and it upsetting their audience it was their game design so if it is causing problems yes they should fix it that what patches are for correction its upsetting a portion of their audience as you mentioned you have medium quality internet speed which is why you are not experiencing lag comp problems you are not experiencing it more than 5 of the time but other people are some people experience it constantly which makes it unplayable to those people it happens to the host or high speed connections in order to try to make it more fair for those that have higher ping times the key word here is compensation it is handicapping players and is very frustrating to those that are being affected so i think you are missing my point i am not saying lag comp does not exist and ruin the game for some people i am saying that a lot of people bitch about it and all of a sudden everyone has their game ruined by lag comp that flat out wrong if seriously every match you suffered from extreme failures of lag comp then you would ever even try to play the fact that you try to play is that it does not honestly happen every match but it does happen some people do honestly have lag comp issues every match but if you are trying to play i very much doubt that so long after if you are then move on do not buy things infinity ward ask for your money back something beside bitching and claiming that they are ruining the game for everyone because they are not when i am online there usually around 50000 people online if 25000 of them are playing with it ruined that still only half the audience and i really do not believe that 25 000 people would spend hours playing a game where they can do nothing but get killed due to lag compensation issues seriously think about the magnitude of the failure you are trying to put on lag comp sure it is not perfect and yes some people do have their game ruined by lag comp but its not a majority honestly its not a large portion either that minority is just vocal about it because they have something to say ,-1,blackops2
scoducks,honestly in my experience any communication in great communication between teammate in cod but i know what you mean most of these features will be used by tournaments but probably wo not be as cool as treyarch is hoping or at least that what i think especially with the listen in feature ,4,blackops2
scoducks,no its a real thing never said it was not but if this is such a major issue how come i very rarely experience anything like this people including in this video claim its broken but me with my medium quality internet speed think it fine 95 of the time now before you jump on me for just cuz you do not experience it does not mean it is not true because i just agreed that it was real i just think people make it out to be a more prominent than it is how empirical data i have played days worth of mw3 online and like i said around 5 of the time my deaths just moving around have some real game breaking failure in them then you see videos that feature maybe a dozen times they have nonsense happen so somehow that hard fact that lag comp has ruined the game ruined the game ruined the game that the claim people try to make that the claim which is a bit ridiculous in my opinion yes janky unfair things sometimes happen sorry your information along with that of up to 17 other people cannot be transported thousands of miles instantaneously applied to the outcome of the game 100 the way you want it to 100 of the time and then instantaneously be applied to your machine at home what you need to realize is that if they fixed it odds are they would induce problems for me and the rest of the community who currently does not have these game breaking issues then when we said um infinity ward could you maybe please tone that fix down a little so we can still play too or as it would probably happen from the majority like it kinda is now obviously this is an extreme response omg f ing no0bz inf ward ban lag comp you are all such god d idiots etc and then we would have the current crowd both the ragers and the calm intellectual presenters such as the fellow who made that video saying nope they already fixed it its so much better than before you do not have any real problems like we used to get over it which is basically what i am saying to you right now you get where i am heading with this you claim its broken for you i say its fine for me you say the solution is something that 1 infinity ward would go out of their way to spend money on and 2 could potentially break the game for me i had issues with black ops just as much as i do with mw3 when it comes to lag comp shenanigans the reason i enjoyed it more and this is something i have compared offline is what i mentioned in previous posts black ops is a better game hit boxes in mw3 seem too large large enough that i sometimes feel like i got shot while around a corner in a lan game which is most definitely not caused by lag comp so that ends the wall of text that i am sure will just keep people raging and downvoting because i am not hating on lag comp but whatever i have been given no real reason to edit caught a couple typos ,0,blackops2
scoducks,no you were right they are called scorestreaks now not sure where bullet got the name cod point streak ,11,blackops2
scoducks,i feel like vahn mentioned in one of the streams that there is round based domination and normal domination so i think a lot of what we say from gamescom was the competitive match stuff not public edit not that that means the competitive playlist wo not also be in the public scene as well ,1,blackops2
scoducks,that not what i am saying you said that mw3 is basically unplayable while black ops is completely fine it does not make sense that this happens for only some people if its an error with the networking if its janky game mechanics coupled with some lag then sure its unplayable for you because black ops is a better game does not mean networking is broken i do not see how that does not make more sense to you but then again apparently i must have a mental disability if i can logically reason an error in networking that induces lag would affect all players it would alter games often not always but more than normal latency could account for while a game mechanic is something that certain players could be ok with while others would really disagree with it and thus not enjoy the online multiplayer ,-1,blackops2
scoducks,so wait your main point is that because i have not experienced it does not mean it is not there so to use your logic just because you have experienced it does not mean it is there honestly if you have lag sure things wo not match up which i have seen in both games i mean come on you have never got tomahawked where the killcam clearly showed it sticking to the region near where your leg used to be but your assertion that black ops somehow is completely immune to any issues with lag while modern warfare 3 is not only vulnerable to latency problems but actively supports the inclusion of such problems exclusively through errors in the game itself is what is completely unfounded take a second and think about the extremes you are applying to this situation and then compare to my reasoning i say different game mechanics you say one major developer hired a bunch a of people with no knowledge of networking to set up their online multiplayer feature who completely destroyed its usability with such obvious and major losses of accuracy while one major developer did it 100 perfectly really think about it so can we agree that whatever problems you personally may have experienced the most logical reasoning is not that infinity ward is inept edit a couple typos hopefully i got them all it late here ,-1,blackops2
scoducks,pick 10 scorestreaks no deathstreaks just to point out the three two biggest changes to gameplay they are making with black ops 2 edit kklown pointed out that there were not death streaks in black ops so that should not really be counted as a change since that technically just a difference between black ops and modern warfare 2 3 ,8,blackops2
scoducks,a source on this info about host selection could help me figure out and explain what is going on in more detail but in general this concept of most average being somehow better does not really seem to make sense here why the host acts as the server for the game because no dedicated for consoles so everyone is playing from that does not matter if the game picks the player who has closest to the average ping of the lobby to the xbl servers or the player with the highest everyone is playing from that host and then the game runs what is referred to as lag compensation so that the host does not have an unfair advantage many people have been making noise along the lines of no lag comp in black ops 2 or i wont buy not realizing that lag compensation has to happen unless treyarch decided to set up dedicated servers for the console versions of the game but they wo not due to we will call them fiscal limitations so players are playing with one player acting as a pseudo server and that player gets pseudo lag in order to keep it as fair as possible if you are experiencing lag that makes it unplayable which be honest it playable you just do not want to but i will get into that in a moment if you are experiencing lag its because of low ping to your host not some magic hole in infinity ward knowledge of networking mathematics or common sense the last is debatable but the point stands lag is caused by ping so the reason i think maybe you are fine with blops and not with mw3 is the difference in hit detection an actual gameplay difference not a networking thing the hit box in mw3 even in offline split screen seems a bit larger than it should be to me thus when combined with a little ping you get killed while already around a corner or some such nonsense end of story if you do not like mw3 mp as much as blops its because black ops was just a better game as is my opinion this idea you have the mw3 is worse because of networking issues is to the best of my knowledge simply unfounded i have never personally experienced a large difference in lag between the two installments of cod i have had lag in both and near flawless games in both i am sure somebody will come on with expertise in networking and say i am either right or wrong but i would really like to see a source that details how each game does their matchmaking before starting some sort of debate sorry about the wall of text but i hope it clears some stuff up ,-1,blackops2
scoducks,you keep saying that people with best internet get hit the hardest but its your ping to the host that determines lag compensation and i have heard blops1 changed their lag comp and people are having a hard time with it but i have not noticed at all i am still playing blops1 you have not noticed a change because of what me and other have said ping not bandwidth is the largest determining factor ,0,blackops2
scoducks,as far as i know that either has not been said or has not been decided a few things to note would be first and foremost that vahn said in one of the livestreams that they are not sure who they will let livestream that stuff costs money but it will probably start as everyone then be limited to league play or maybe only the upper leagues but that for streaming the codcasting it would follow could only be done live for games that are being streamed or by a spectator s in a private lobby i would like to see it where there was a playlist where people could enter to play in one queue and other people can get on to cast people would get matched to lobbies as a caster then ranked by the players when they watched the cast afterwards as well as anyone who spectates the cast this would stop people from trolling as getting reported as a troll would get you banned from the caster playlist and allow for undiscovered talent to be found i am unsure if i would like to see a caster rank that matches you to different leagues of skill based on your skill as a codcaster i will think on it more but that all just speculation really do not know too much about how people will get in the casting position as the gamescom agenda has been more to show off the features of the casting tools rather than the details of how it works also as i mentioned before they probably have not figure it out yet anyway edit a couple typos in this wall of text,2,blackops2
scoducks,it did not really bother me either saw it pretty often though the only people who really care think they are cool are the 12 year olds who make them and the wannabe hipster i do it cuz its funny and bothers people guys and it is outweighed by the awesome stuff you see in a lot of the other emblems ,0,blackops2
scoducks,hopefully you will be able to automatically have it saved to your theater though that way you can a rate the caster b see how you did from an outside perspective c hopefully meet a good caster that you can work with in the future and d maybe even get a few laughs make a friend with this aforementioned caster ,2,blackops2
scoducks,agreed i just hope that treyarch sticks to their guns and does not make kills kills with scorestreak rewards worth more points as i have seen a lot of chatter about people wanting if anything i hope they bump up the points for uav assists caps defenses and those sorts of team based things slightly like 20 for a uav assist instead of 15 nothing major to reinforce that people have to play the objective help the team if they want to pwn noobs like they do in mw3 i very much doubt many people who currently play this sort of mode in public matches currently being in mw3 will even play public objective based modes anymore let alone participate in league because they know that scorestreaks is the end of their 1337 skillz getting them 4 k d and that being a sign to anyone of how good they are ,1,blackops2
scoducks,no the caster will be talking about both teams so the teams cannot hear what he she says ,3,blackops2
scoducks,no worries i think every time i tried to type scorestreak i typed killstreak first they will take some getting used to but once people get used to it team play will get a lot better in this cod ,1,blackops2
scoducks,i believe the orange arrow is an upvote yes edit which i gave you since somebody apparently downvoted you ,1,blackops2
scoducks,yes league play the ranked matches ,1,blackops2
scoducks,universal score would not reward playing the objective and with no respawns in s d why would you even need a higher scorestreak get a uav with a few kills and the rest of their team is toast game over you win why would you need a chopper ,0,blackops2
scoducks,i also think it was just defends and stuff headshots probably give more exp but i would be surprised if they gave more points towards a streak for that ,0,blackops2
scoducks,ya too many people think that k d is all that matters ergo i plan on playing ranked so i can for once be on a team that seems to care about the objective ,1,blackops2
scoducks,i think he meant kill whoring as in the guys who currently play and go 35 3 but never get near a single capture point then call you trash for sucking when he she did next to nothing to really help the team and sure kills and calling in things help but some players just refuse to get in the mix and attack points or even really protect points because they just want to boost their k d which is why i want treyarch to bring back the kills in other modes do not affect total k d they did in the first black ops edit minor typo correction ,0,blackops2
scoducks,and dogs are a super powerful scorestreak if they were easy to get you and everyone else including me would hate it because you would spend every match getting eaten alive by the dogs if anything i would say they should give you more for caps i would like to see it as 200 but even without that think of it this way cap for 150 plus getting the cap probably required you to get a couple kills so that a total of 250 call in a uav get some uav assists and you are at 300 do this 4 times and you are calling in dogs as a reward for good team play get a few kills but more assists caps and uav assists than people currently play so what you are looking at is this in one life get 4 caps 8 kills 4 5 assists 4 6 uav assists which with assists averaging 40 and uav assists staying at the 15 we have seen so far puts you somewhere between 1200 and 1300 which is damn good but over 800 of those points will be from playing as a good teammate that is caps and some sort of assist which is what i think read hope treyarch will manage to get into black ops 2 and do not forget you will have a second scorestreak after the uav in there to add to your scorestreak ,1,blackops2
scoducks,wildcard for 2 lethals not tacticals tactician allows you to put another tactical in the lethal slot but you do not have to have that to get 2 pieces of tactical equipment with the exception of tac insert which i am sure you can only have one of no matter what wildcards you use and the motion sensor which i think i remember hearing somewhere required tactician to have two of ,1,blackops2

scoducks,does tear stand of something if not i think you meant terror edit to be clear that an honest question about if tear is supposed to stand for something i am not trying to be a grammar nazi douche ,0,blackops2
scoducks,just to add on another bonus to shooting down a uav is that you steal points from an enemy sure it only seems to be 15 per kill but that could be the difference between them getting and not getting something higher up ,3,blackops2

scoducks,this david vonderhaar could not give a better answer than this i think because this is basically the answer he gave to this question but still well said 8bitaddict ,3,blackops2
scoducks,good points throughout i had not really thought about it being private matches and all that i would like it if it did not show exp though seeing as how its now points that matter i could think its confusing if i see numbers popping up for things like paybacks and calling in scorestreaks i mean i could easily imagine a situation where i would be unsure if i got 50 points in uav assists or 50xp for the avenger not that i would not be able to just look at the progress bar but seeing as exp does not really matter to the game until after the match when you can unlock things i think it is possible that the focus on objective philosophy could cause this change to happen we will know soon enough so i will keep my fingers crossed but you are probably correct on this one edit wrote the longest sentence ever fixed it for readability ,1,blackops2
scoducks,well said ,2,blackops2
scoducks, video proof http www youtube com watch feature player detailpage v zqz 5 sw4b0 t 131s that what is shown on screen is points not experience while i am sure scoring points gets you exp the op was asking if what is being shown was scorestreak or experience related its scorestreak info that the videos are showing and yes halofreak7777 i am sure that they translate to exp as well but the game does not seem to be spamming you with exp messages see this example http www youtube com watch v qcqg4n97hx8 feature player detailpage t 781s where the player calls in two scorestreaks without any numbers popping up unless you do not get exp for calling in scorestreaks then the numbers on screen are not exp which is what the op was asking about ,1,blackops2
scoducks,you want to try that again there champ ,10,gaming
scoducks,um the same way it works if you rank up multiple times in a match currently what i mean is you just get everything you unlocked after the match is over so you get two or more tokens instead of just one ,3,blackops2
scoducks,i believe on of the videos that out the caster say that not exp coming up that your score so its points you are seeing not exp ,2,blackops2

scoducks,i am with greymonk on this and thus in the minority of the universe it seems cot catches a lot of crap for how slow and pointless it was but stuff still happens just not s the first time we see ashaman or the cleansing of saidin which both came at the end of books that people say are bad what people really mean i think when they talk so much crap about the skipable books is that they are not as good as the rest of the series which does not make them bad just not as great ,1,WoT
scoducks,the heir being narishma whoever retrieved callandor would be he who follows after or some such its way back but i am 97 sure that rand quotes such a prophecy and reflects a little at how dangerous it was to trust narishma to bring him callandor before the battle with the seanchan ,6,WoT

scoducks,i like your use of the word strictly specifically how clearly you use it as a synonym for unfairly almost right particularly in the sciences is not right i am not saying no points for correct work with a wrong answer but a lack of strictness leads to students getting by without really knowing what they are doing or why and i think its also important to note that i believe you are referring to this paper http onlinelibrary wiley com doi 10 1002 ejsp 753 abstract which although it makes the claim you say the study also concluded that teachers grading with red pen find more errors meaning that when a student is wrong a teacher is more likely to notice when using a red pen so red in the sciences should be advocated according to this paper although they avoid drawing that conclusion sources the study http onlinelibrary wiley com doi 10 1002 ejsp 753 abstract and i teach math and always grade in red,15,funny
