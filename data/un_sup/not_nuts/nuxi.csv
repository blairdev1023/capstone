nuxi,i did a quick survey of x86 64 kernel images in distros for reference 3 14 is the introduction of kaslr 3 16 is the first time it was not compile time exclusive with hibernation suse 13 2 3 16 6 no fedora 23 4 2 3 no arch 4 4 1 no centos 7 3 10 0 no ubuntu 14 04 3 3 19 0 yes since 14 10 and it apparently got backported to 14 04 lts when they updated the kernel debian sid 4 4 2 no chrome os yes so ubuntu is the only distro with it compiled in keep in mind kaslr is not really all that strong the amount of entropy in the randomization is rather low the linux kernel is not really a stable target to begin with and so even without kaslr most exploits already have to look up offsets in order to run on multiple distros there are plenty of information leaks in the kernel available for this purpose make sure to set proc sys kernel kptr restrict and proc sys kernel dmesg restrict to 1 at the very least although the kernel devs are working on reducing them as the old saying goes the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step so i decided to ask the debian package maintainer to compile it in i guess we will see what he says eventhough i do not think it provides any real security i would use it if it was there ,1,linux
nuxi,look for config hibernation and config randomize base in your kernel config often available at proc config gz or boot config kernel name after that you can look in proc cmdline to see if kaslr or nokaslr was in the boot command,2,linux
nuxi,no until recently it had a compile time conflict with hibernation they resolved this recently by allowing them to both be compiled in but they still have a runtime conflict if both are compiled in then kaslr is off by default unless enabled by a boot parameter so i am not sure how many distros have actually enabled it ,2,linux

nuxi,i work in engineering at a company that makes equipment but i do not work in it so oddly enough this is from a user p q do you accept a prefix from your isp 60 or 61 for example and then delegate 64 out to your internal networks do you ever use anything smaller than a 64 no we have a 44 from arin for ipv6 we have a 20 from arin for ipv4 q do you go to your local rir arin ripe apnic lacnic afrinic and get yourself a 48 and announce it to the world via bgp we only have the arin or provider allocations q do you run all ipv6 internally and then run nat64 at the perimeter this option seems unlikely given the wide variety of devices on corporate networks ever try enabling ipv6 on a hp laserjet we dual stack so its public ipv6 at the desktop but rfc 1918 for ipv4 not all of the systems were ready for ipv6 only q what addressing scheme static slaac dhcpv6 are you using for networks that normally run dhcp for ipv4 slaac but afaik our it guys would prefer dhcpv6 once it actually gets supported everywhere q do you just say too hard ipv6 has no place in the corporate network we just need moar nat and leave ipv6 up to the carriers and kick the can down the road a few more years we stalled on it for years because it was not a pressing issue we tested our own gear by proxying connections off boxes in the same subnet ultimately all it took was an official request from engineering to it to light up ipv6 so that we could stop with that nonsense we are distinctly a dual stack network though internally we are probably 95 of the way to supporting ipv6 only hosts when you bring the external cloud services into play it probably drops like a rock i bet google apps is the only one that does ipv6 the vpn servers are probably the main internal bottleneck the vpn servers support ipv6 and because of that if you connect on the vpn you are still ipv4 only rather than dual stack ,2,ipv6

nuxi,what people do not seem to get is that the worst roads exist around freezing which is what happens when it snows down south at that temperature the daily temperature fluctuations cause the snow melts to water and then freeze back into ice strictly speaking the purpose of salt is not so much to melt the snow but to keep the freezing point of the junk on the road well below the daily temperature range that is also why as you go farther north more sand and less salt is used up there the normal freezing point is way above the daily temperature range so they do not have to worry as much the sand is applied simply as a traction agent personally i prefer roads up north in the winter to the crap we get here in se michigan up there is too cold to melt and then freeze also the lack of salt on road means my car lasts longer note that this is a bit more complicated than just looking at the air temperature ground temperature cloud cover time of day wind speed and traffic volume play into the equation to affect the temperature of the junk on top of the road ,-1,Michigan

nuxi,there is actually a reason to not draft women for combat roles that has nothing to do with their physical abilities in combat the reason is not quite as important with the style of warfare we currently engage in but thats not necessarily a good reason to just ignore it in a war of attrition you are basically sending people to die and hoping your enemy runs out first a population will recover faster from a large loss of the male population than the female population i doubt this would be an issue for a country as large as the united states but some smaller ethnic groups fighting for independence could end up achieving a pyrrhic victory i have mentioned this a few times with some friends discussing women in combat i am not arguing against it i am merely pointing out that the concepts like saving women and children first may exist for a reason ,2,AskReddit

nuxi,i trolled one admin into rage quitting and taking his server down twice the first time was because we suspected him of using give for his own benefit he oh so subtly hid the items in chests at the spawn point so that none of us could steal his cheater supplies i blew them up with creepers and hid them items in chests all over the map he took the server down so that us proles could not have 64 stacks of golden apples the other time is not quite as funny and just involves drama about how bans were handled for people using a server bug on top of the fact that there was some bias involved in who got banned the fact that this was done without any warning was a big issue because many things used in game were dependent upon bugs ,2,Minecraft
nuxi,i think i was the only non carebear playing on my server at one point i would run around doing crazy things at night like creeper hunting without any weapons i would also spend days exploring huge caves it was all great fun the entire time i would be doing these things everyone pestered me to use a bed if i had to name one feature i would like removed from minecraft it is beds i do like the fact that you can move your spawn point with them because it makes building things far away from the server spawn point more practical what i really do not like is how much the ability to fast forward through the night time is encouraging the minecraft carebearing ,2,Minecraft

nuxi,the faq for fetchmail reveals another interesting tidbit about exchange imap server ms exchange violates the pop3 and imap rfcs its list command does not reveal the real sizes of mail in the pop mailbox but the sizes of the compressed versions in the exchange mail database there is actually a flag to tell exchange to do it right but when i tried to get it turned on at the place i work i was told no because it has a negative performance impact ,4,linux
nuxi,no i see exactly what you are getting at you are only imagining this change in terms of how it would affect the sov holding residents of a system try putting yourself in the shoes of a solo intruder wandering around someone else space for them this change turns nullsec into w space ,1,Eve
nuxi,correct its not exactly like w space local but it is effectively the same in both cases you end up having to be on grid with people before you know if they are in system the only difference is in one case they only show up on your overview and the other they also appear in a list in a chat window this effectively turns nullsec local into w space local regardless of whether or not it behaves exactly the same ,1,Eve
nuxi,oh do not forget that the uni banned slosh ops too i think it was a month before i left that they banned the fc from being intoxicated at some point after i left they banned everyone from being intoxicated on fleet ops i do not get whats wrong with slosh ops as long as the fc is upfront being intoxicated ,3,evedreddit
nuxi,its not but i do not think ccp has any intention of turning nullsec local into w space local and you said the same thing at the start of your post ,1,Eve
nuxi,actually re reading that section of the blog entry makes me think they are not referring to the intel channels used by nullsec alliances at all i think they are refering to actual recon work like the kind a division of my alliance spends many man hours doing which only makes me wonder if they do not realize that people do specialize in it doing your homework well is already more rewarding and that the data collected has lifetime ,1,Eve
nuxi,from the standpoint of the system occupants that would be a fairly interesting approach and i like the idea the problem is that when flipped around you realize you just turned nullsec into w space for the intruders ,2,Eve
nuxi, if you do something stupid like trying to travel through a system in a battleship with active neutrals reds you might get laughed at if you get caught and are asking for help i think you mispelled carrier they are very restrictive in an attempt to make their killboard look better there are a lot of wtfs in the e uni rules too take for example the fact that a 2 day old newbie is allowed to fc a fleet anytime they want but you have to take a class and be certified in order to fly a cloaky scout ,3,evedreddit

nuxi,jita fountain goon staging system vfk and the current test staging system the obvious followup is what ships should you have with each clone your jita clone does not need anything you will just get shot by wardec griefers if you undock although if you are clever and train a few trade skills you can keep your jita clone somewhere other than jita 4 4 without losing access to the market ideally you would have atleast one alphafleet and shieldfleet ship at the test staging system an alphafleet ship at the goon staging system and something for home defense which probably means a shieldfleet ship in fountain rifters are always an option for some of these if you are space poor personally i like to keep a rifter at all of them as well anyway ,1,evedreddit

nuxi,okay maybe acceptance is a requirement i will give you that but there are in fact places that in game currency is accepted i have seen players sell forum hosting voice chat hosting etc to other players for in game currency i have been on muds where players are encouraged to create new content for the server and paid with ingame currency so clearly these markets where in game currencies are accepted do exist likewise the blackmarket existance of gold farmers itself proves there is a functioning currency exchange to real money so opium is not money because it is a commodity nonsense commodities have been used as money for hundreds of years in the sparsely settled american colonies money as it always does arose in the market as a useful and scarce commodity and began to serve as a general medium of exchange thus beaver fur and wampum were used as money in the north for exchanges with the indians and fish and corn also served as money rice was used as money in south carolina and the most widespread use of commodity money was tobacco which served as money in virginia the pound of tobacco was the currency unit in virginia with warehouse receipts in tobacco circulating as money backed 100 percent by the tobacco in the warehouse rothbard murray a history of money and banking in the united states the colonial era to world war ii http www amazon com gp product 0945466331 ,1,IAmA

nuxi,as i already attempted to point out with bullet 4 an argument based on acceptance is trivial to refute try to pay your bill with mexican pesos and you will encounter the same issue yet pesos is real money likewise with opium is certainly money and while i am sure you can find someone to accept it as payment your power company is probably not one of them likewise i can refute the backing argument opium is not backed by any government in fact its illegal in most places yet it functions as a currency ,0,IAmA
nuxi,i think this is an argument that needs to be defened rather than just asserted as true so i am going to play devil advocate really how sure are you of that most games have an established real money exchange rate what makes usd any more real than in game currency no physical item your bank account is just 1s and 0s too no intrinsic value neither has the usd since we abandoned the gold standard not backed by a government so are plenty of other established currencies like opium not used outside of the game how far outside of mexico are pesos used the reason you do not see in game currencies used is that they tend to be inflationary due to the actions of players like the op but this really is not very different from why you are not doing transactions with zimbabwe currency certainly the extent to which the above points are true vary by game some companies like ccp go the extra mile and employ a real economist to monitor and tweak the in game economy of eve ,8,IAmA

nuxi,ummm if you leave your gun unlocked at home and someone steals it and goes on a killing spree you can be sued for negligence in most states note that negligence does not mean you are absolutely responsible for the deaths obvious the shooter is negligence means you are responsible for not excersizing due diligence and locking up your firearm or not leaving your keys in your car as in this case ,0,WTF

nuxi,im not the biggest fan of the subsidies but this those subsidies are what keep your food prices low if you remove them production will decrease and prices will go up we wo not run out of food because eventually prices will have risen enough to make it economical to farm again but if you remove the direct subsidy the prices will go up and more people will need food stamps to pay for it so anybody pushing for complete removal might want to think twice perhaps a good overhaul of the what is subsidized and how much is in order though ,1,politics
