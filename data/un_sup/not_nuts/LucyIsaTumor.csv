LucyIsaTumor,that really depend on a number of factors i will just speak conceptually since i am not sure how you implemented your code your character is likely an object an object that was created from a class and has a number of attributes the most important attribute being its x and y location these locations you should already be using to blit the character on screen now let think we have the characters x location and we need to move the map depending on where the character is what i like to do and what is usually runtime friendly is just to do a test if the object is at the middle of the screen meaning the x location for the object is greater than or equal to half of my screens width so great the characters at the middle of the screen and we want the background to move well the background can be moved every frame by just adjusting the blit locations of that image say you start blitting your image at 0 0 and you now need to start shifting it to the left you will want to decrease the x variable in the blit location how can you do this well you can do this a few ways as well specifically i have used global variable let say map x and map y lastly let bring it all together my object is at the center of the screen you can call a function or use a boolean or an if check something changes if that object is at the center if it true then you want to decrease the x coordinate in which you draw image however you only want to do this while the user is pressing the right arrow key on their keyboard or whatever they press to move thus you will need a second check just to ensure that they are wanting to move the map repeat the same for the other direction and you my friend have a moving background ,2,pygame

LucyIsaTumor,no kidding we inherit a bit of knowledge here and there very rudimentary knowledge we call instinct but it would be amazing if we could inherit the inter workings of a fully developed adult brain although evolutionary speaking we would likely have to deliver every child by c section since their brains are too big to be birthed naturally that why human brains are limited to the size they are i believe if humans were no longer delivered in a natural sense our natural cranial capacity would increase due to natural selection babies with bigger heads do not always make it ,1,Showerthoughts
LucyIsaTumor,certainly show up on time even five minutes early can display a good work ethic just because this is a professional atmosphere do not be afraid to ask questions however do not repeatedly ask the same question because that will become a nuisance take notes of all the questions you have so that you quickly learn what is expected of you if you are dealing with customers i suggest getting familiar with good customer service experience take a course if you have to there a few on lynda com that are excellent but currently lynda is down due to the amazon web service issue essentially just try your best to make the customer happy without being overbearing feel free to go over and above if it will make the customer happy and does not interfere dramatically with your workload however you are just learning the ropes i would suggest making a habit out of your regular work schedule and learning what you need to do in your job then begin going above what is expected of you lastly to behave like a grown person means just do not do anything that a teenager working a movie theater job would do i work in an office where we still have a good time and joke around do not be he one serious guy that never likes to joke however when it gets down to business you need to be ready focused and serious to handle the task at hand ,1,AskReddit
