Dupmaronew,she said that the opening was great but then she started to cough and could not catch her breath and then the next thing she remembers is being in the helicopter ,3,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew, she was jumping at spaceland houston this past weekend exited fine during a hop and pop she passed out under canopy and landed in the trees she was airlifted to the hospital she was discharged already and is back home but trying to pay for those bills is gonna be tough ,7,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,i have heard that before i assumed that why i did not see anyone doing it anymore ,1,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,i do i was just wondering if anyone else was still doing it it super simple same as a pro pack all the way until you lay it on the ground i am sure there is a youtube video that shows how to do it easily ,2,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,i always just found it faster and easier for the reasons you stated some people had issues with the whole it being rolled and essentially having to unroll i never had an issue i suck at pro packing and always had better openings with a well done psycho over a sloppy pro,4,SkyDiving

Dupmaronew,for those that did not know david he was one of the greatest guys you could know he was instrumental in my return to jumping he would sit down with new jumpers and work with them he was understanding and would work with people at their own pace he would also push you to work up to bigger things and take the time last time i saw him was two weeks ago and we were dirt diving a four way right before the plane got grounded he saw that i was doing a solo and encouraged me to jump with them and lowered the difficulty of the jump to suit me without blinking an eye he would welcome a new jumper to jump with him blue skies brother ,27,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,met him last night our beards had a moment and then he disappeared into the crowd ,3,MiLB

Dupmaronew,well said i agree about taking an active role in safety i refuse to get on the plane without a gear check then i always have someone i trust recheck my pins before i get out once under canopy i look to see where my handles are and i put my hands on them to make sure i know i also make a point to watch my altitude once under canopy and know where i am at so i can have the mindset of be ready if something happens ,1,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,i started jumping 10 years ago school and life got in the way and i was gone for about 3 years then i got back into it and then was out for about 3 more then came back in 2015 and stopped when i herniated a disc in my back in december 2015 i got current again this past april and then my home dz announced it was closing for good at the end of march i guess part of me is just trying to make sure i do not drift away from it again trying to not let life get in the way again ,1,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,yeah i did not realize one could be rented i am gonna look into that ,1,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,basically what i plan on doing just taking it easy and getting a couple jumps in and staying current ,1,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,yeah no my rigger will put it back in foc,1,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,170 i plan to be very conservative 2 way belly solo maybe a 3 way with my coach friend i will be pulling higher at 5 do not plan to push it just trying to to stay current get my jump numbers up to 200 since memorial day beach jumps got changed to a c license ,2,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,did not realize this was a thing for sure will look into this ,2,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,there is also that whole school of thought saying that they should not be forced sucj as the motorcycle helmet laws i personally generally always wear a helmet when riding and always have an aad however there are times where i have riden without a helmet and now this might be a time that i get a couple jumps without an aad ,2,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,well said i think it got mathematical and shit but i get what you are saying ,1,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,oh i for sure plan on taking it super easy not gonna jump with anyone i do not know and likely will just do 2 or 3 way at most ,1,SkyDiving

Dupmaronew,if you have a freefly friendly rig and not some student rwb dolphin rig crap exit in a sit then just arch and go to belly it will help with your sit for later on if you choose too play around with that and it will get you unstable and help you work to getting back to it ,2,SkyDiving
Dupmaronew,whole bunch of unofficial reasons and then the official personal reason of the owner officially gold coast was started by mike igo and he died 7 years ago his wife has run it since she has personal reasons for it that she talked about at family dinner saturday night that i am not going to go into it definitely was not an easy decision unofficially we have heard and the local business owners have said that the city are a bunch of assholes they wanted the dz to pay more money for the use of the land and a cut of the profits the otter is going to need a big service by the end of the year as it only has 950ish landings left we actually ended early on the last day cause a fuel pump went out and it had to be grounded they finished the tandems up with the 180 last year they opened a cessna 180 dz half the distance to new orleans and so most the tandems go there now cause they do not know any better this pulled the money out of the big dz etc ,1,SkyDiving

Dupmaronew,some guy in another thread said it was his first and asked for my opinion on it and other series i am gonna a copy and paste what i said to him if you are interested in other ocr events i will coment on tm after talking about the others and this is going to be a lengthy answer so yeah overall favorite is battlefrog xtreme but since they no longer exist i would have to go with savage race it much more of a challenge and a fun medium course length their obstacles are pretty innovative and provide a good mix of fun and hard ran the pro heat last year and it was a great time did both in texas conquer the gauntlet is by far the hardest race when it comes to obstacles imo it pretty much an upper body suffer fest did the elite wave and a second lap right after in arkansas last year foam fest is super easy but fun as hell in a group cause all their stuff is inflatable and covered in foam and it cheap xtreme air is fun if you can get it cheap and just want to get a run in it another inflatable and super easy but still a decent time if you go full out the whole way i have burnt myself out on spartans got a triple trifecta two years ago and a double last year this year i will only get one they need to change get their obstacles they are not trying enough new stuff texas is a good venue for spartans austin and dallas being the best alabama course is fun but you need a buff on cause it dusty af mississippi was a really fun fast course and hopefully they bring it back chicago is a good one and different than a lot cause it got crazy terrain changes and a good amount of mud south carolina was ok but not my favorite world championships in tahoe are a blast and will kill you at the start with 7 miles straight up it hailed on us the first year and people were getting pulled for hypothermia the stadium sprints are a good change of pace also hopefully they bring one to the dome as for local races you have play dirty it a joke of an organization and unless i can get one for 30 or under i wo not do one ran the extreme course last year and it just felt so cheap and almost dangerous cause the build was crap then there is also battle races they are fairly new just started holding races last year but they have their shit together i know the owner through running on his team with spartan he a spartan coach and he knows what people look for in races battle is about 30 obstacles in 3 4 miles so it very back to back he favors multi rigs a bit too much for my taste but it keeps it hard did the warzone for the new orleans race last year currently signed up for warzone in all three races baton rouge new orleans gulfport and it worth it if you want a challenge works just like bfx did with 6 hours to complete as many laps as possible adds a good challenge of having to support your nutrition through the day also ok so tough mudder i have ran 4 so far favorite course was dallas and least favorite was florida first and foremost tough mudder is not a race they state this at the start it the only major ocr the does not have penalties for failed obstacles it definitely promotes teamwork to get over their stuff such as pyramid scheme and blockness i guess berlin wall is a team obstacle but i prefer to just do it solo if you did the half then that sucks if you did the full then right on this course was extremely flat compared to most races it for sure the flatest course i have ever ran and talking to staff they admitted that they missed out on terrain and thus why the mud mile was done twice they tried to compensate with the amount of mud overall on the course this was also the muddiest course they have ever made i liked it cause it was a nice fast course but at the same time there was not enough technical terrain as for the obstacles they for sure did not have the same difficulty they have had in the past this was the first race of their season and they were trying out new things that debuted at worlds and that they modified for regular course on saturday i ran the regular course just to see what new mudders were getting and today i ran the legionnaire course so i could challenge myself a bit more did king both days cause fuck getting shocked for no reason i was bummed to see thay they took the menthol gas out of birth canal a bit bummed they got rid of the pegs and the rope wall did not like that they had ropes on pyramid scheme today i really liked their new version of funky monkey but wish it would have been longer i would like to see at least another horizontal wheel in there stage 5 clinger was tough but a bit of a let down wish they would have brought king of the swinger also as that was a favorite i think they ran into the problem of this being the first major ocr to come to nola louisiana and not already having established structures in place overall i enjoyed both days hope some of that info helped ,3,Toughmudder
Dupmaronew,on saturday i did today i fell three times from it lost momentum once missed the grip the second time had no grip strength left the third try ,2,Toughmudder
Dupmaronew,i will coment on tm after talking about the others and this is going to be a lengthy answer so yeah overall favorite is battlefrog xtreme but since they no longer exist i would have to go with savage race it much more of a challenge and a fun medium course length their obstacles are pretty innovative and provide a good mix of fun and hard ran the pro heat last year and it was a great time did both in texas conquer the gauntlet is by far the hardest race when it comes to obstacles imo it pretty much an upper body suffer fest did the elite wave and a second lap right after in arkansas last year foam fest is super easy but fun as hell in a group cause all their stuff is inflatable and covered in foam and it cheap xtreme air is fun if you can get it cheap and just want to get a run in it another inflatable and super easy but still a decent time if you go full out the whole way i have burnt myself out on spartans got a triple trifecta two years ago and a double last year this year i will only get one they need to change get their obstacles they are not trying enough new stuff texas is a good venue for spartans austin and dallas being the best alabama course is fun but you need a buff on cause it dusty af mississippi was a really fun fast course and hopefully they bring it back chicago is a good one and different than a lot cause it got crazy terrain changes and a good amount of mud south carolina was ok but not my favorite world championships in tahoe are a blast and will kill you at the start with 7 miles straight up it hailed on us the first year and people were getting pulled for hypothermia the stadium sprints are a good change of pace also hopefully they bring one to the dome as for local races you have play dirty it a joke of an organization and unless i can get one for 30 or under i wo not do one ran the extreme course last year and it just felt so cheap and almost dangerous cause the build was crap then there is also battle races they are fairly new just started holding races last year but they have their shit together i know the owner through running on his team with spartan he a spartan coach and he knows what people look for in races battle is about 30 obstacles in 3 4 miles so it very back to back he favors multi rigs a bit too much for my taste but it keeps it hard did the warzone for the new orleans race last year currently signed up for warzone in all three races baton rouge new orleans gulfport and it worth it if you want a challenge works just like bfx did with 6 hours to complete as many laps as possible adds a good challenge of having to support your nutrition through the day also ok so tough mudder i have ran 4 so far favorite course was dallas and least favorite was florida first and foremost tough mudder is not a race they state this at the start it the only major ocr the does not have penalties for failed obstacles it definitely promotes teamwork to get over their stuff such as pyramid scheme and blockness i guess berlin wall is a team obstacle but i prefer to just do it solo if you did the half then that sucks if you did the full then right on this course was extremely flat compared to most races it for sure the flatest course i have ever ran and talking to staff they admitted that they missed out on terrain and thus why the mud mile was done twice they tried to compensate with the amount of mud overall on the course this was also the muddiest course they have ever made i liked it cause it was a nice fast course but at the same time there was not enough technical terrain as for the obstacles they for sure did not have the same difficulty they have had in the past this was the first race of their season and they were trying out new things that debuted at worlds and that they modified for regular course on saturday i ran the regular course just to see what new mudders were getting and today i ran the legionnaire course so i could challenge myself a bit more did king both days cause fuck getting shocked for no reason i was bummed to see thay they took the menthol gas out of birth canal a bit bummed they got rid of the pegs and the rope wall did not like that they had ropes on pyramid scheme today i really liked their new version of funky monkey but wish it would have been longer i would like to see at least another horizontal wheel in there stage 5 clinger was tough but a bit of a let down wish they would have brought king of the swinger also as that was a favorite i think they ran into the problem of this being the first major ocr to come to nola louisiana and not already having established structures in place overall i enjoyed both days hope some of that info helped ,1,ObstacleCourseRacing
