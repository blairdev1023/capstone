jayjay5665,not really most of the stuff you can buy with phoenix credits is shit,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,well know im legit going to kill every player that moves in the dz i just think its a tad op that a addicted player likemyself wouldnt need for know high level dz rank ,0,thedivision
jayjay5665,thank fuck some one asked i currently do 52k damage per crit with 60 crits and 148 crit damage ,0,thedivision
jayjay5665,yea sweet dude good luck out there agent ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,let me just say this i per ordered the game back in 2013 then changed my order to digital gold edition and sat there for years hyped as fuck about this game i then as soon as it came out stayed of school for 2 days and didnt go to work that weekend and everytime im at school or work i just want to get home to play this amazing game i highly recommend this game to any one that likes mmos and your a stalker guy like my self this game sort of brings backs those shadow of chernobyl memories when im in the darkzone theres so much content and lots to do im never bored really im just bored right now because im at school waiting for the day to end d if you have any other questions hit me up ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,hey guys just wanted to say that we need melee builds like a ability or some sort of secondary weapon that replaces our pistol i made a post but it was requested to be moved here hope you guys agree on how fun it would be to run around with a golf club or a baseball bat ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,something tells me you havent played much of this game,0,thedivision
jayjay5665,well at your request it shall be recorded today d,2,thedivision
jayjay5665,ok so you want to sort of ignore stamina ish but make sure you have enough so you dont get de stroyed i reccomend crit build get a high default fire rate smg that has extra crit bonuses and then get gear with crit bonuses you gun will scale with your gear dps and make sure the gear is in the firearms stat when you run a crit build pve becomes a breeze full dps lmg build the pakhan lmg high end you can get is amazing at pve it completely melts through enemy armor and has 50 default bullets per mag try to get one and scale firearms lmg damage and a bit of health back on kill,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,yea or so you can scale them with skillpower,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,well when u do no dps and some one has fully built tank i doubt you will,0,thedivision
jayjay5665,so you cant recalibrate weapons unfortunately but you can with gear so recalibrating is when you re roll for say a stat like for example your 500 stamina stat and you can change it into fire arms or tech its mainly used for items that are good but dont suit your build for example i found a good pair of crit gloves and they were useless in tech so i re rolled them into firearms so with the shooting part focus on a main weapon for factors maybe one weapon has higher rpm and a tiny less damage or maybe you have good crit chance with it also it really depends on what level enemy you are vsing hoped i helped if i didnt just respond and evaluate a little more ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,should i make a video explaining my op build and how i can never be beaten in battle,2,thedivision
jayjay5665,yea i just pvp now d,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,his build is not actualy that good ,0,thedivision
jayjay5665,so what are you looking for a tanky healer a tanky dps just straight dps with a bit of health ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,its pretty easy right now i usually 4 5 hit highly geared dudes that dont use there sig skills but takes me like 30 bullets when they do use there sig skills i go solo most of the time just farming bosses for pe or i usually go hunting rouges,2,thedivision
jayjay5665,for dark zone i recommend a ish balance between the 2 so you dont get wrecked by rouges ect but for farming challenging i do just mainly dps because team mates can quickly heal or i can heal myself,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,eww jobs and such ahahahha i stayed home off school and didnt go to work for the first weekend ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,yes i had 6k pe before nerf now im down to 400,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,depends on what you are doing more darkzone or pve ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,at the vendors the most helpful thing for me is the blueprints for gear you can keep crafting them over and over to suit your build which insanely helps though i havent fully found what im looking for yet soon ill be rolling around in about 240dps but i need more health i have a item currently that gives me extra 30k dps but reduces my hp by 20k which is not worth so i recommend to safe pe to craft gear loadout 160k dps 70k hp 15k skill power currently rocking a crit build with 60 crit chance 110 crit damage and 100 headshot damage bodyshots do about 70k crits and headshots 120 130k,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,yep stayed home for first 2 days,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,also using a sub with a unique crit chance irrelevant to the stat,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,160k dps 70k hp 15k skill power currently rocking a crit build with 60 crit chance 110 crit damage and 100 headshot damage bodyshots do about 70k crits and headshots 120 130k,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,yea,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,currently im at 140k dps 66k hp and 20k skill power i have 5k armor aswell its just all about farming and getting better loot i reccomend you try get more damage as crit chance usually over 50 means your gunna crit all the time ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,yea ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,my dps currently is 140k gun damage is 10 6k and crit damage ranges between 50k 70k my health is 60k and tech 6k cool screenshot http steamcommunity com sharedfiles filedetails id 643721553 ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,health is useless if you have a gun with a high rpm and mag size with a good stability that melts you in 3 seconds ,0,thedivision
jayjay5665,oh so your a tanky healer ahhh ok for pve thats ok but the meta right now is just out damaging your oponents for example my friend currently has 140k tech and 200k health and hes still being 4 5 hit by my build due to the damage output and how long it takes for healing animations to go through,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,its good but tech tank builds are not really viable in pvp for pvp they are especialyl with the reduced damage sig skill but in pvp the main aspect to win a fight is how much damage you can output i dont reccomend you try pvp with just skills because for example a turret when you have 100k tech still dies really fast and doesnt output that much damage i have 6k tech and currently it outputs 500 damage per shot so its entirely up to you but if your skills fail you will have to fall back to that damage from your guns and you wont have any so you will dead,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,ill update the guide with a powerful low tier build now,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,i dont reccoment snipers in pvp because 1 you need to be a good shot and 2 if you get rush ed you loose viable seconds switching weapon also now skill power builds arnt that powerful due to the medusa nerf,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,im not gunna just kill everything lol you do realise the penalty practically of going rouge there is no benifit ,0,thedivision
jayjay5665, ,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,i have the liberator but again boring im looking for something funny to spice it up,0,thedivision
jayjay5665,yea im doing you could say a glass cannon build but the broken part is the crit i do 50k damage per crit and the crit is pratically 100 of the time,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,yep same here,1,thedivision
jayjay5665,pretty sure my season pass stuff just popped up like 2 mins ago so im assuming they have overloaded the server or taken it down so people get there shit,1,thedivision

jayjay5665,you should not be critiquing if you are a beginner then you obviously have no clue what you are talking about ,1,photocritique
jayjay5665,p s your photography is legit terrible sorry but you say i take random stuff you legit just took a pic of redbull focused on it then whacked a filter on it lol please dont be a hypocrite ,0,photocritique
jayjay5665,this is meaningful it portrays people like you who judge things by their covers every picture has a purpose and a story whether its a pointless plant or a boot like you you portray this image as a lame stupid skylight with just light coming through but you do not know the background story behind this piece like this picture everything has the poor shallow dark colour to it but eventually the colours come through and just a fyi pictures are more better if they are un edited i tried my best to line this up centre with my eye i also see that in your photos there is allot of random stuff in it such as your recent post with the subject and stuff in the foreground you have also gone ott with the editing with filters which really gives it a bad look go look at the most finest pieces of photography and you will see that anything that is pleasing to the eye such as symmetry is one of the best techniques when doing photography ,0,photocritique
