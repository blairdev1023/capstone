I1TheInternet,they were up 3 1 and in control still getting better and with a healthy team had a great shot at taking the series they did not get dad dicked for the rest of the series like the narrative will have you believe the warriors were the better team in the finals and only an injury here a suspension there and a great performance over there managed to take them down by four points they could still have gotten to the finals this year and won them and it would shock no one if kd never came thru they did not need him they wanted him but then again who would not ,1,sports
I1TheInternet,regardless of how fairly and how cleverly this team was built it still is a super team it an insane concentration of talent with an amazing coach that i doubt existed before sure there may not have been as much building but the result is undisputable ,2,sports
I1TheInternet,defensive issues vs offensive is a difference worth noting they did not attack the same way and the adjustment they made included letting lebron relax defense a bit on barnes and attacking curry also draymond suspension and bogut injury helped them at least a bit and a half this year they cannot keep up with the warriors who even have a bailer outer in kd also 5vs4 5 defense and 5vs5 5 defense is an enormous difference and the cavs seem to just get tired by the end of the third quarter when you are limited physically it harder to win than when you have chemistry problems like i said things can still go the cavs way but the way the dubs have converted two pretty bad games whole bunch of missed layups in game 1 and 20 to in game 2 into 20 point victories speaks to their credit more than and extra 2 points of win margin ,2,sports

I1TheInternet,everybody is a candidate not everybody gets top 3 amount of votes tho ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,cavs outperformed lebron less cavs less than the thunder outperformed westbrook less thunder this year imo and valu is determined by performance difference keep in mind that this only concerns the regular season ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,curry last season was pretty valuable tbh and the warriors did not play well without him at all also d rose during his underserved mvp season was extremely valuable to his team while lebron had bosh and wade with him westbrook was definitely more valuable to the thunder than lebron to the cavs this season as the cavs had kyrie and love to help valuable to the league maybe best player yes valuable to team i do not think he would get it every year tbh ,5,nba
I1TheInternet,and you also cannot forget how clutch he was and with what roster considering one of the stars it was built for and relied on left westbrook absolutely demolished team after team after team with lots of persistence occasionally not letting his team lose even if they looked like they wanted to see last triple double vs nuggets his season was so insane it makes sense why he is not scrunitized as much for his win number ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,you know what he meant,4,nba
I1TheInternet,he also said stat award but it really is not that and previous seasons with wilt and oscar robertson prove that ,2,nba

I1TheInternet,last time i tried replying to myself i got downvoted to like 10 ,-20,nba
I1TheInternet,honestly i think both cases had to do with switching directions rondo used to drive in like that until it was made into a travel where he would land on a foot and then shift it more to provide a more horizontal push from the ground so when both zaza and lma closed out and saw the ball leave they turned around while shifting their foot more to get a more horizontal push from the ground and therefore more acceleration cos 1 the shift in this process can actually be expected to look unnatural and excessive so the intent is a better rebounding scramble but the result is a dangerous shuffle with zaza the situation would be as simple as that and with lamarcus he shifted his foot to go for the rebound then found it inaccessible so he turned around again making it look even worse ,-1,nba
I1TheInternet,the narrative would be but yes that would be horrible ,28,nba

I1TheInternet,link or it did not happen ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,today it likely that the warriors would win even with kawhi playing but people were saying i remember one instance in particular that game 1 is the spurs best shot at a win even including games 3 4 and i do think that his injury was what allowed the final swing to be sufficiently large for a warriors victory so while kawhi is unlikely to be what decided who wins the series he likely to end up being the difference between a 4 and 5 or 6 game series ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,oracle has been selling out since december 2012 ,1,nba

I1TheInternet,honestly i could see germany taking wwii if they still had rondo ,34,nba
I1TheInternet,it is irrelevant good far you get in the playoffs if you do not get to the finals and both teams have about the same probability and while boston may be a more likely contender because of its conference it is not a better contender because quality does not always reflect results ,1,nba
I1TheInternet, trade blake that how it goes iirc ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,and it beautiful ,9,nba
I1TheInternet, more likely and better are not synonymous when discussing title contention in different conferences i am fairly confident after seeing the problems that boston had with rebounding against chicago before rondo went out that is that they would be at a severe disadvantage against the duo of dj and blake both of whom are elite rebounders and then there the talent difference the clippers clearly out match the celtics at the 1 4 and 5 positions and hold their own on the others and coaching disparity despite what people say about doc he a very competent coach and definitely better than what the celtics faced in hoiberg give me celtics to play in the first round over jazz any day nothing short of an utter embarrassment or injury dismantlement would lose us that series and even the clippers might not be able to choke that one away with all due respect the clippers are a nightmare matchup for the celtics and i do not see why the latter is a better contender if they are unlikely to contend against the the very team they are better than ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,i never defend him as gm except when he re sign deandre jordan and almost always do as coach and i have yet to see anyone besides apparently jamal crawford who takes a different stance in regards to his performance as gm ,7,nba
I1TheInternet,his gm skills and his coaching skills are two different aspects of his career tho as a gm he pretty bad and i wo not argue that but as coach i think he quite underappreciated i honestly do not see what people base their arguments on when they say he sucks at coaching his main issue is legit overplaying vets one of which retired this season while the other can actually get hot every like 5th game besides it not like the spurs are exactly putting out the high school class of 2015 as their starting lineup and while doc coaching competence is not comparable to pop this similarity does imply that playing vets a lot is not always a losing move the rest of doc coaching plays timeout calls performance out of a timeout chemistry defensive rotations practice locker room atmosphere appear pretty good and are often unjustly ignored when he being discussed ,20,nba

I1TheInternet,yeah but the fans romantization of the phantom is completely irrelevant both to his portrayal and his character ,18,AskReddit
I1TheInternet,you attack incest but the very reason it unacceptable right now ie has grown to be so is the possibility of genetic mutation that causes people to be born with two recessive traits that code for something undesirable which is more likely to happen when only one family gene pool is involved however taking into account that man was made perfect and little time had elapsed since creation incest does not appear to have any issues as far as i can tell then you bring up jonah who literally tried to run from god face and was provided with a second chance through whale belly time and the reason he would need that second chance because according to the bible man is protectionless without god and has protection only while doing his will these stood out but i can go on to the other points too and people really give god less credit than he deserves even from a purely atheistic shallow analysis standpoint ,-15,AskReddit
I1TheInternet,he killed the messenger because the messenger said he killed saul that very unjust to twist it like that man also i do not know which dude you are saying he murdered to get the wife promised to him because that completely false you cannot just make up stories about people and say they are bad man ,3,AskReddit

I1TheInternet,i think ugliness is usually meant as unattractive to the majority of people cannot displease them all but if most people and convention places you on the ugly side i think that what is usually meant by the word that said sometimes i see a girl that i think is quite unattractive but is somewhy captivating there was a meme on bwt about this saying something along the lines of that one girl you know is ugly but you cannot stop staring at i cannot find it for some reason specifically for that reason and i cannot be the only one in that so even being ugly is not always bad though of course this usually refers to some characteristics and not others ,4,AskReddit

I1TheInternet,first of all that just your opinion man subjective matters cannot be logically categorized as incorrect just because the public opinion differs from that of some individuals secondly what i think lavar is doing is he relying on the possibility that lonzo becomes a superstar if someone is to be as convinced as he is on the matter then the shoes could be literally walk on water what are those 3s and be worth the money for them because their resale value during lonzo superstar days would be insane if people knew what mj would become when he was still in high school his shoes from then could sell for thousands the problem with the bbb shoes is that few people if any believe in lonzo like his dad does so it not worth it for them he trying to sell a product that likely wo not exist for the price that it has not appreciated to yet and likely never will so while you may think the shoes suck and are overpriced they can be liked by someone that is not insane and if lonzo becomes a generational player their price will turn out to be worth it ,3,nba

I1TheInternet,i stand by my decision lebron is a playmaker the best of the four no doubt and is top three in smartest players in the league likely top 1 neither one of the two would be able to take him out on pure athleticism plow power and while for the whole game kawhi may be a better option to put on lebron throughout the length of a game in a game winner or late quarter situation you need maximum anticipation of the player next move and knowledge of his tendencies which draymond has demonstrated possession of very convincingly seeing what is happening and adjusting accordingly and knowing what is going to happen is something that unlike in reaction time and raw skill draymond edges kawhi out in and i personally see it as more valuable in a lebron game winner circumstance ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,people just being reactionary because kawhi had an amazing game man he still elite and nobody doubted that but i have no idea why they are saying he blows others out of the water this season or that he so certainly the best he was undoubtedly the best and is likely to be the best again but he is not likely to take dpoy this year for a reason even as he continues to be an elite defender ,7,nba
I1TheInternet,idk man draymond has had at least four enormous stops this season with the game on the line you can pick kawhi and i will take him to defend curry and harden but it up in the air for kd and i would go with draymond for lebron ,15,nba

I1TheInternet,i honestly think the narrative about this change is at least 5x more dramatic than the change itself just like yolo and rachet i think it has more with going out of style than actually becoming offensive in fact the word is still not too infrequently used in a negative light to describe situations where i am at though it does not enjoy nearly the popularity it used to and i do not know that anyone in world history has ever been offended by it being used that way ,3,AskReddit
I1TheInternet,i think that putting in effort and stuff like you describe is still condoned as always but the perception on the things that people invest that energy in has changed different things became cool and people still doing things that were cool then appear cringey i cannot really think of particular examples and wo not stand by my point very firmly because of that but i think it important to consider the possibility that the situation might be the same as before just centered around varying activities ,3,AskReddit

I1TheInternet,you could light a fire that way but usually a twig that will burn for any amount of time near a match burning time will take at least about 20 seconds to ignite because it was not previously dried like a matchstick and usually you want about 5 10 seconds of very bright burning time so the twigs inside the pyramid ignite stray twigs do not burn very brightly yes it works but a match simply outdoes a bic in this case and seven definitely do ,1,gifs
I1TheInternet,yeah i know i know that you could lift a fire that way but usually a twig that will burn for any amount of time near a match burning time will take at least about 20 seconds to ignite because it was not previously dried like a matchstick and usually you want about 5 10 seconds of very bright burning time so the twigs inside the pyramid ignite yes it works but a match simply outdoes a bic in this case ,1,gifs
I1TheInternet,lol you are cute nobody struggling with anything it is however pretty easy to sand the head off a match on the side of a box or break it while striking i am not saying it a major problem but when the box only has like 1cm x 1cm square left of anything resembling a striking textture that half worn down you are likely to kill at those seven matches trying to light one anyways ,1,gifs
I1TheInternet,i set up fires all the time and every time the goal is to light it with a single match without using grass leaves or paper i have lit dozens of these through the years and know what i am saying basically you want to have smaller twigs in the center which catch quickly the wood structure resembles a teepee and to reach into it it much easier with a match than a bic yes those longer sticked ones will do better but the post is not completely useless like people try to make it out to be ,0,gifs
I1TheInternet,the striking strip often fails and rubs down the match head or breaks the match when you try to light it especially when you are past halfway through a 200 match box ,2,gifs
I1TheInternet,it easier to light a fire with a match than a cheap disposable lighter that fits in your pocket because you can poke a match deep into the setup and leave it and do not have to shield it from the wind worrying that it will burn your fingers before the fire starts also people are saying use the side of the box but it often does not work and breaks the match or wears its head down this is not a bad idea compared to a cheap lighter or a simple matchbox ,-7,gifs
I1TheInternet,i think he was entirely too focused on olynyk at that point and after the shot went off bradley had already started running in a bit before wade did so even if wade knew about him coming in switching directions and contesting or getting in the way was too likely to result in an and 1 to attempt so he just stood on his side of the basket and hoped it would fall his way the shot would be short to be honest i am not really knowledgeable about actual basketball playing systems either but it just does not look like hustle would help wade much here after he missed the initial rotation to olynyk also he may have thought that he had teammates coming in from that side as there were three of them there so maybe two slow reactions one to the rotation and one to process the fact that the shot was on its way but i would not use this as anti wade defense evidence more as an interesting sequence and fast reactions by boston still not exactly a moment of glory for father prime ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,heh,4,nottheonion
I1TheInternet,honestly the only flaw i saw was switching to olynyk too late otherwise the whole play did not really demand any more effort he runs after bradley but then the latter gets picked up he should have rotated to olynyk to cover for butler switch and seemed a bit slow in realizing it so when he saw what was up it was too late to contest the shot then he got in position to rebound expecting the shot to be short but when it went the other way there was no way he would contest bradley anyways no matte how he hustled in fact his hustle was fully adequate ,28,nba
I1TheInternet,his rotations are his only major flaw and that only because he prefers old player but so does pop we usually do very well out of a timeout our defense is solid except on the perimeter sometimes our team is tightly knit and our offense is not stagnant i could say snyder offense is iso joe secrit play but you know very well that not the case the same goes for jamal he gets lots of freedom but he has 23 usage which is not bad considering rivers was out and jamal can take care of the ball till he decides to chuck it doc is solid not elite but i feel like if he did not gm he could invest more time into coaching and get there ,0,nba

I1TheInternet,his feud with jimmy butler is as likely to have been made up as actually true sure he did not play alongside him very well but he was not coached as well as he would be with the spurs after jimmy breakout and patty would be the one deferring the bench ball handling responsibility so he would not really need to submit to anyone if he were to get the starting role instead he could be taught to play a drive and dish role which would give kawhi lots of space to operate once the defense collapses rose is still in the higher tier of drivers on the knicks he been deferring to kp and melo quite a bit and i do not remember his ever criticizing or disobeying a coach except his trip to chicago which is unlikely to reoccur with the stability that the spurs organization provides rose conforms to systems as he told and i do not see why he would be a problem to fit into the spurs ,12,nba
I1TheInternet,doc draws plays nice too we usually do very well out of a timeout today fourth quarter was an exception and i think overall he could match budenholzer or snyder his lineups are his only major downside and that mainly due to overplaying crawford and saying he overrated when this sub treats him like a bottom 5 coach in losses and does not give him credit for any wins is a big stretch sure maybe top 30 is a bit high too but i often see people act like he hot trash and he does not deserve that ,6,nba
I1TheInternet,he plays nice defense gotta give him at least 3 credit ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,if there was no warriors superteam and blake was still healthy we would be a legit championship caliber team smaller chances against the rockets due to perimeter defense but if the thunder could take one off of them and make two of the others close i see no reason why we could not take four people always overexaggerate the gravity of the clippers situation they are a great team and have been hanging out at the 3 4 seed for the last three seasons and had a shot at the 3 if blake and cp3 did not go out this game was fully winnable but the jazz got hot and i feel like this series still favors us why break up what is working sure it not winning rings but it winning games and fans and occasionally series and getting good chances at other series where injuries do not happen there no way that breaking this team up would improve its situation so doing it would be simply illogical ,0,nba

I1TheInternet,yeah but when rondo is playing he handles the ball more you have to guard the ball handler butler becomes the primary ball handler when rondo goes out so butler has to create more instead of feeding off of rondo also with the ball in rondo hands other teammates become a factor because rondo is the better distributor of the two you cannot sag off of anyone when anyone could be getting the dime next once the primary facilitator goes out you have a person sagging off of a guy because butler is less of a pass first player making a double team more feasible butler is a great powerhouse and shot maker but while he can do it for some time playing as the offense instead of as part of one will take a toll on anyone in the clutch butler exerting himself will get you points but you cannot just do it for the whole game and in order not to have to you must have someone else handle the ball and help the team share the load oh and i suppose resting minutes might be easier to come by with rondo in the game though i do not have the numbers to back that claim up ,7,nba
I1TheInternet,it hard to play well when the defense gets to focus more on you and there nobody to find you at the right time also hard to make threes at the same rate when you are not set up as well and rondo was also contributing to rebounding in a major way as well the bulls primary advantage in the series defense also helps with confidence and rondo was great at that too there a thick line connecting your points and rondo absence ,5,nba
I1TheInternet,yup i legit think that bulls win in six or less if rondo does not go out he their main facilitator and playmaker and he had an amazing bbiq one of the best in the league to say his injury did not switch the series from favoring the bulls to favoring the celtics is insane it the only factor that did imo ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,his attitude is great and he a very coachable guy he overvalues himself a bit but i do not think it reflected in his willingness or lack thereof to let someone else carry the team through the game ,31,nba
I1TheInternet,it only a 52 43 edge if you take away the point guards 52 33 if you take away russ and harden which is more fair but less convenient for the narrative however using only supporting cast we have a 25 point rockets advantage and if russ harden assists are removed as well i am not going to look for 3 pointer assists as outside shooting was pretty even this game the margin rises to 37 pts take that as you will but russ definitely was more valuable to his team than harden was today i am not discussing other games ,8,nba

I1TheInternet,i have no idea how this scripting programming thing works but if you can edit the data input it would be useful to automatically add one assist just as he goes to the bench for the last time or the game ends and just run it through your model because if russ does indeed stop assisting after assist 10 then there would be many times where he gets only ten as the tenth is likely to occur near the end of the game anyways and the extra non assisting time would be unaccounted for i am sorry if i am saying obvious stuff but i just thought if it not obvious it could be useful ,2,nba

I1TheInternet,well yeah but westbrook has had a triple double whoel shooting 13 13 i concur that that not the max that steph could get but westbrook inefficiency should not be looked at without considering his production which is at an elite level and helpful for his team ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,it does not have to be optimal to be acceptable ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,in order to know the cost one must know the alternative outcome which we do not there no guarantee that his teammates would make the shots and he had two assists in that quarter which is not amazing but it averages out to 8 per game which is solid i am not saying he had a great quarter or even a good one especially by his standards but it was not the embarrassment of a quarter that people make it out to be ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,15 points in a quarter is pretty solid imho ,1,nba

I1TheInternet,he had both limbs but rested his head on one of his arms whilst sleeping exposing the armpit would have been a raised hand if he was standing and it fell asleep he woke up from dreaming of having that arm blown off and then could not feel it naturally you try to move it first or find it with his other hand if you cannot move the arm you can at least make sure it there with the help of the other arm because it was behind his head and he had no sensation in it due to it being asleep ,16,AskReddit
I1TheInternet,my mom knows a guy that fought in afghanistan and after he came back he had a dream that he got his arm blown off by an explosive the poor guy woke up to find that he had slept on the arm and it was laying above his head unresponsive so he feels for the supposedly removed arm with his other hand and it gone and needless to say ,21,AskReddit
I1TheInternet,lac ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,oh i do not doubt the clippers capabilities i just think that paul george has a game that would be more useful for our team as well as a less whining prone attitude though that can change under doc i think blake is an amazing player and i am thankful to have him play for my favorite team but i still like our chances better with pg in his place ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,just came into the game hot headed and overconfident is all i still like our chances even if gobert comes back tbh but honestly if pg13 is eyeing lac like i heard he is i would make the substitution in a heartbeat ,1,nba

I1TheInternet,technically they allowed one win and no losses ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,he draws plays pretty well and keeps the team away from drama and locker room issues he also respected by the players except like mo in the beginning of the season sure he complains a lot but that does not make you a bad coach his only issue is questionable lineups and that mainly because he keeps crawford in too much honestly this loss was all blake turning the ball over and jamal shooting poorly everyone just trip on doc too much but honestly i would take him over at least half the head coaches rn ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i actually feel very good after this loss we came in hot headed and overconfident i expect a solid bounce back and still think we have a great chance at winning this the clippers are not going to play like trash all the time but blake has really got to figure out the turnover problem all in all it was just a game of dumb mistakes and jj could not hit a shot for some reason also i hope austin rivers does not have too much that when he comes back because he much more useful than jamal or felton on defense something we packed this time ,-2,nba
I1TheInternet,well if you are going to specify playoffs you are probably implying he better in the regular season which i do not think he is also he passable not trash but not great either shooting also does not tell the whole story ,1,nba

I1TheInternet,true a switch there would practically be a lane split even in the beginning of the vid though if civic started in the middle lane it was still switchable if going at a good speed up until white started intentionally blocking the gap it a dumb move and even if he completed the switch it would be a bad decision because when traffic is that dense the right usually moves faster or the 2 3 right lanes alternate speed the most making them easier for a speed advantage you could even see here that the left lane was backed up farther if you are going to be a bad driver at least be good at being a bad driver ,1,Whatcouldgowrong

I1TheInternet,but the op was asking if the depth affects the mass flow rate it is implied that this is at a given instant any system is at a steady state instantaneously therefore we can just bernoulli that sucker like it unchanging and be done with it is what i am saying so like i said you are not wrong to say that pressure is what affects the mass flow rate because it does due to depth but bernoulli equation applies just as well because the mass flow rate in question is at an infinitesimal time period and is therefore for that time period steady as well as the depth ,1,answers
I1TheInternet,i do not think we are talking about the same bernoulli equation i am discussing the one where rho gh 0 5 rho v 2 p constant it relates the pressure to velocity and absolutely does account for the height of the water above and has nothing to do with convection yes there are others of his the thermodynamic ones that have convection and head loss and stuff in them but this is usually what is referred to as the bernoulli equation once again i am not saying you need to use it to solve the problem but it does sum up what is happening ,1,answers
I1TheInternet,bernoulli equation relates pressure difference and velocity so while yes it is pressure that determines the velocity bernoulli equation describes that relationship so while yes this is a simple pressure problem it does relate to the bernoulli principle which is what pooptimist was asking ,1,answers
I1TheInternet,then you just make it define instantaneous flow velocity rather than final ,1,answers
I1TheInternet,the last one https place dynastic co runs the best on mobile browser i have chrome for mobile while the others are not laterally scrollable you are confined to a vertical rectangle just saying for the curious ,3,place
I1TheInternet, meaning the bernoulli effect does too the velocity of the liquid streaming out is proportional to the square root of the pressure difference by bernoulli equation and to the mass flow rate except at supersonic speeds where it becomes inversely proportional to the latter and we have to account for choking of the nozzle ,7,answers
I1TheInternet,although the answer is still yes your version of it is incorrect i am afraid the water that comes out of the hole is not from the top but from the bottom and has fallen precisely zero meters before reaching the hole regardless of the amount of water in the cup the pressure from the depth of the water on the other hand does change the velocity of the emerging water ,0,answers

I1TheInternet,i would not be surprised if the warriors cavs spurs rockets celtics clippers or jazz pull of a championship run where everything just kind of comes together for them warriors cavs would do it with talent spurs would kill it with strategy rockets would shoot their opposition into nothingness celtics have it much easier than the west except the cavs but it doable in the east and can potentially get lucky in the finals the clippers have lots of talent and their interior defense is solid and their offense is not bad either and the jazz are long and tough sure the former four would be favorites by a large margin but parity is not really as dead as one may think we did not think the wizards would sweep the raptors in 2015 but it happened maybe some team here would create matchup problems like that too ,3,AskReddit
I1TheInternet,maybe he values franchise stability and good player coach relationships more than rings maybe he likes his teammates maybe the clippers are not even a bad team and have simply had bad luck occasionally dropping a game or two but not consistently i do not know but honestly saying people need to get out of one place or another seems very rash to me anthony davis needed to dip from nola until demarcus came the lakers squad needed to ditch their team last year because it did not develop them well john wall needed to leave the wizards for a while too now blake needs to leave the clippers and porzingis needs to desert his team and we hope jimmy butler can find himself a place but maybe just maybe any one of their teams can turn it around right quick and contend like the warriors unexpectedly did from the end of the 13 14 season to the beginning of 14 15 the clippers have played at a great level for the last four years and honestly can still take any team save the warriors on any given day not to be confused with being the second best team in the league blake also seems to like it there why would he want to leave ,57,nba

I1TheInternet,a stem intern at a school that studies engineering and tells his fat students to lose weight also has not managed to land a very fit chick because most people do not especially stem majors ,5,iamverysmart
I1TheInternet,i agree with your notion it just that the rockets cold streak has more chance of spanning multiple games also the clippers rely a lot on dunks and less on the three pointer and their interior defense is quite solid from the eye test so while the clippers going cold is unlikely to exhaust their scoring ability the rockets going cold would all but take away their main source of points and the clippers could potentially trouble their secondary one layups and dunks quite well to begin with that said i would not bet on the clippers just like you cannot bet against the spurs and there little chance of them taking the series with how their perimeter defense is at the moment ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i mean yes but last year the thunder even had a special nickname for collapsing and then there are the wcf of the same season do not get me wrong this sucks but i really think people are way overreacting and the clippers can still potentially win against anyone but gsw in a series ,5,nba
I1TheInternet,what pressure were they handling today they legit just got cocky and stopped playing it was not so much a collapse as a giveaway tbh ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,rockets if they get cold like halfway through the season though lou seems to have that covered i have no idea what they plan to do against kd and curry together with klay and dray tho ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,do you really think he was not wrong maybe about them having very little chance of winning the title but the fact that he was attributing it to the clippers being bad and not to the warriors building a juggernaut is ridiculous this team is every bit capable of taking the rockets jazz and even the spurs in a seven game series and one game indicates nothing especially after they bashed the jazz yesterday that same bench that forgot that the game is 48 minutes ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,still a beast and perfectly capable of carrying a team isaiah was absolutely wrong in my opinion and barring injury clippers can potentially win any given series though i have little faith in them against the warriors and rockets with their current perimeter defense people will always overreact and even though i am not sure i can get positive karma with this comment right now when cp3 gets a 20 0 ast to game people right away call us contenders or nearly so ,0,nba

I1TheInternet,still a solid coach imo the lineups are not always the best but he draws good plays and the teams is never in conflict except when they were complaining about complaining but that was not a major issue or drama or disarray in terms of relationships between players and between players and coaches we always manage to stay more or less on track and if they did not get overconfident and legit give up they could have had this game too i too get annoyed with doc periodically but i do not think he a bad coach or even in the bottom half and even though people trip over his gming we still have a solid bench do not me and starting five and big three that say they are staying he no pop as a coach and no presti gm but i am not going to complain too much ,-6,nba

I1TheInternet,i still maintain that that clippers are a great team they barely had time to get into a rhythm in the season and as the players games evolve you cannot just say they should have it figured out over the years as both their abilities and the league play style changes mental toughness has been the only fixable issue that haunted them and i think they showed that they can deal with it occasionally at least when they play with less desperation and more cool headedness like game 6 against sas in 2015 people always hate on this team and say stuff is not working but they have been consistently having good winning records despite injuries and showing sparks that cannot be ignored just because something has not worked out due to bad luck a few times does not mean it cannot work out at all sometimes a series of misfortunes occurs and people are hasty to write it off as bad planning or structure that the case here imo that said this game was an absolute embarrassment and they should have a stronger mentality if they wanna win a series or two in the playoffs ,6,nba

I1TheInternet,oh my bad for misinterpreting it then i have just seen loads of talk on this topic before including during this season ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,austin rivers has been getting better each year and we can still make some moves in free agency there no reason why people on other teams cannot get injured still and the spurs while consistently playing solid basketball cannot seem to really counter straight power like the clippers and thunder brought the last two years the rockets are quite streaky and if they get a cold stretch the clippers can take them out the jazz has a history of doing poorly against the clippers and even though this is a different jazz team the mentality problems that haunt the clippers most can be less of a concern in that series gsw is still figuring their chemistry out and it only takes one missing piece to put them at a temporary disadvantage that long enough to let their competitor take the series sure the clippers do not look like the likeliest champion in the next few years but they sure can still play see 14 2 with historic defense and there no reason things cannot go their way for a change ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,blake addressed this before and i think he has a point he said something along the lines of previously when people spoke about the clippers curse it concerned draft picks getting hurt and injuries and stuff like that nobody spoke about the playoffs then then it switched to the conference finals there no reason they cannot break through that one too ,3,nba

I1TheInternet, the clippers have trotted out pretty much the same starting lineup 4 years running shit is not working rockets9495 2017 i was responding to this and i do not think their starting lineup has issues on the other hand i fully agree with you that their bench needs to step up and i also think that they need to get their mental toughness issues figured out ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,injuries were not kind to the clippers for the last three seasons they rarely have the time to find an identity and get into a rhythm because someone important is always out sad stuff but honestly i watch this team because i find it entertaining not because i identify with it so i really care more about enjoying games than about wins would be nice to actually get a championship run going tho ,5,nba
I1TheInternet,consistently 2 4 seed with very good net defensive and offensive rating and barring injury a contender for the last three seasons the team plays great and one game is not an indicator of its overall performance cp3 and blake just came back from injury and even in that time that they were gone almost half the season either one of them was we were not exactly losing games left and right just because they got blown out this time does not mean they cannot play well in fact the warriors got blown out by the lakers once the only real issue i see this team having is they let people teams events get into their heads and stop believing in their own ability which is also what i think happened tonight barring this yes it is working ,10,nba

I1TheInternet,every person that has ever tried a crossover and lost the handle was in the same situation just because he did not manage to grip the ball as well as was necessary or because he did not flock his wrist hard enough does not mean it was dumb to try to many moves in basketball are risks and ones that pay out win games the begin the back pass in that situation saved him time and allowed him to make a completely unanticipated pass to an open man it would have been an excellent pass if he did it exactly the way he usually does it ,-10,nba
I1TheInternet,that was not a bad pass let the downvoters eat cake i said it in the first thread it was posted and i maintain my point of view his hand slipped but it was an easy pitch through a wide open lane to a wide open person literally a little flick of the wrist this pass here was far more difficult and unnecessary and still not that bad given the open path the ball had the pass in the finals was poor only because of execution not decision making and if we are to judge by execution nobody should ever take a three since they have a 50 success rate ,-23,nba

I1TheInternet,i do not know if the rockets will go any worse than 17 5 tho and that the best they can do if we are to go undefeated and match them i am predicting a 4th seed for clippers just because there not enough regular season left to win five more games than the rockets ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i was implying that the clippers capture 3rd as a joke ,1,nba
I1TheInternet, they could end up the 4th seed there no way the rockets drop to 5th ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,usually happens when contracts expire and good players want more cash but then blake and cp3 start they will re sign so i do not think it will be this year and probably not the next ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i am hyped for a 30 10 10 season already so the points thing is still unfinished ,14,nba
I1TheInternet,oh yeah that the one good catch ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,2 9 tov game on 28 3 usage is not bad at all tbh this is his second lowest season turnover average after the 2010 11 where he played 26 games last season he was arguably much flashier but he still averaged a decent 3 3 tov game 7th in the league on 32 6 usage 2nd which is still pretty good even if flashiness is hurting his turnover stats it is not impactful enough to actually make an argument that his bbiq is anywhere near insufficient or to be a problem ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,this is so sad westbrook buddies all left or got traded one at a time it like when all of your friends get early dismissal at lunch and you all have pe during the last period i am not even a thunder fan but i would cry if adams left that team at this point ,11,nba
I1TheInternet,yeah and he actually sells it the most often of the four too ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,yes,4,oddlysatisfying
I1TheInternet,and yet westbrook finished with the most rebounds ,17,nba
I1TheInternet,i have no idea why people are downvoting you steph is wicked smaht and he usually actually pulls those passes off his court vision and decision making are great and he an excellent playmaker as well it very hard to be an elite player without at least an above average bbiq even if that pass is taken into consideration which i do not think it was a bad decision so much as a bad execution it silly to say he has a low bbiq ,18,nba
I1TheInternet,i hope i am down if he gets one with the spurs or something after the clippers inevitably stop being able to keep the roster together be cool to get a few white banners in staples tho ,40,nba
I1TheInternet,i read one that said imagine waiting nine months to give birth and it you ,14,nba

I1TheInternet,me too except i like the existence of the clippers above the 31st seed if it has to be another team i am all in for the spurs ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,stephe kerry,4,nba
I1TheInternet,does not matter if the offense is better than the defense ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,no cp3 i think that arguments could still be made but the clippers were tearing the ground up until the last three or so games before blake went down likely he was not playing his a game is the cause and right now the defense looks very solid imo we will see when cp3 comes back but i would not put the rockets at least pre trade above the healthy clippers ,2,nba

I1TheInternet,that up in the air but they are admittedly better coached and healthier ,0,nba
I1TheInternet,i mean if they tell cp3 and blake we trade you but we are sorry come back next year we will have assets and compete plz do not be mad and ship them off the clippers could really get a doozy of a bargain there but of course that requires enormous amounts of mutual trust and loyalty something that not really fun to build a potential future on ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,no you,16,nba
I1TheInternet,14 15 also was no joke some clippers players even looked heartbroken that someone had to lose at the end a very memorable series that one ,1,nba

I1TheInternet,same imagine dealing rivers and jamal to the knicks for melo and then signing matt barnes that having cake and eating it too except when money and character comes into the equation that is ,4,nba
I1TheInternet,except the ridiculous things are kind of cliche lately they need either to play competitively or to completely mess around a la curry laying down or the celebrity all star game ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,funds the fairest charities,2,nba
I1TheInternet,hey it not like the losing charities lose money the fortune of the fortunate does not multiply the misfortune of those that miss out on it ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,that why she not an 8 in your book 10s are the rarest but not even nearly non existent for me i see no point in having a rating if it is not used imo rachel hits a very solid rating but not the penultimate one the prepenultimate one seems just right ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,how frequently do you use the 10 10 rating also to each his own eg for me selena gomez is at 7 and jessica alba is a 9 so rachel demita falls right in demiddle ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,that was the best option in his situation tbh ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,aight well there was this stunning player in the celebrity all star game name is rachel demita she announces players in nba 2k apparently well r nba went head over heels for her for a day personally i think she aight but not all that 8 10 for me and i actually use the 10 rating she apparently has her own subreddit r racheldemita good times i doubt i will forget that part ,23,nba
I1TheInternet,bruh it like you missed all of friday ,4,nba
I1TheInternet,also if boogie does not re sign this trade is all bad for the pelicans after two seasons if they do not win a ring and get cold free agents that is ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,curry played defense iirc i did not watch the second half but in the first half he was actually trying to go for picks and contests and stuff or acting very well which is still quite amusing ,2,nba

I1TheInternet,nah they share the shaq,1,nba
I1TheInternet,do you even know who the guy with the beard is ,1,nba

I1TheInternet,you do not need to be unhypocritical to be right ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i appreciate curry for playing some form of defense ,7,nba
I1TheInternet,because it would be more fun with defense we can understand it but we do not have to like it ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,man who run alongside car is very fast man,13,pics
I1TheInternet, impossible,3,nba
I1TheInternet,a suspension costs the player money and the team wins tho ridiculed yes that unavoidable people will always make fun of others and the situation itself is admittedly laughable but in terms of suspensions i think that taking it at least three notches too far ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,but why that has absolutely zero effect on society you can say the same thing about homosxualism and be no more cruel that just wrong any way you put it this is some double standard stuff over here edit call me out you guys are downvoting but have no legitimate counterargument man people are scary so it bad when an anything but homosexualism persecutes an anything but homosexualism but not when the areligious persecute anything but homosexualisms i legit never thought there would be any sizeable consensus like this that just insane ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,but was he educated ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,not tonight but i wish tomorrow they play defense ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,that the only way this turns out to be a good joke ,31,nba
I1TheInternet,draymond insisting that he not a robot was suspicious too tbh ,4,nba
I1TheInternet,yeah but it necessary to combat the ideas rather than the people education rather than persecution is what i am saying ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i am saying we need to suppress idiotic thoughts not by force but by teaching and education once a celebrity says something wrong instead of suspending them i would advocate an nba commercial advocating science and free speech and definitely not ridiculing kyrie because that messed up ,0,nba
I1TheInternet,why is it not okay to not believe a fact if a person does not believe it does someone die does someone get hurt does their car break ignorance in and of itself is a matter of decision and i do not see why you say it should not be allowed you say it should not but do not give a reason for it if a person believes they should bring 6 virgins as a sacrifice at midnight in order to remain healthy for the next twelve days it makes sense to stop them because they are harming others now if someone believes that pianos have evil spirits in them that attack the person that destroys a piano what effect does it have on society sure if enough people believe in that they can affect the voting results but if they are the majority and they do not pass laws to persecute the minority where is the problem if society prefers to be ignorant but lets the intelligencia do its thing why should it not be allowed to is not societal satisfaction the goal of society but that is the extreme case in reality it obvious that few people believe that the earth is flat so why would it matter if kyrie stills supports charities and balls his heart out what is the reason to suspend him the worst thing that happens is a few people go told you so and go on with their lives because there really nothing you can do with that information except argue with people the only field where it even relevant is space exploration and even that is unlikely to suffer because people believing the earth is flat would probably want to prove it ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i really was going to just work on the basis of beliefs but ferretsofly said that a given religion should be persecuted if it advocates a given belief which is what my second comment was responding to at that point i was not arguing about the particular case of the suspemsion for believing flat earth theory but about the morality of persecuting a hypothetical religion that promotes it sexuality is analogous in that it is a controllable mindset like a belief and in that it does not affect others also like a belief a preference does not differ from a belief much at all really ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,none i did not say one was but the implication is the permission of persecution of religion ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,usually for every person that downvoting there at least 10 20 people who thought about it but decided it not worth it also i am not saying flat earth is a religion and am fully aware that it is not but what it is is a harmless belief if it is to be persecuted whether by suspension or otherwise it logically follows that there is no harm in doing the same against religion which if not the truth is a set of beliefs which may i add actually condone some form of action ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,there no way ,4,WTF
I1TheInternet,but why that has absolutely zero effect on society you can say the same thing about homosxualism and be no more cruel that just wrong any way you put it this is some double standard stuff over here edit call me out you guys are downvoting but have no legitimate counterargument man people are scary so it bad when a religion persecutes a religion but not when the areligious persecute religions i legit never thought there would be any sizeable consensus like this that just insane ,-12,nba
I1TheInternet,what do you define as intelligence may i ask because cognitive ability is absolutely hindered by these problems and just because they are no less meaningful as humans does not change the fact that they drive the average brain processing power rating down how else do you define intelligence in terms of being informed that would mean that aborigines in like brazil or something would be less intelligent than civilized people which is also false ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,what are dinosaurs ,1,nba

I1TheInternet,y all seem more streaky but that may just be recency bias ,7,nba
I1TheInternet,2x consecutive mvp tho ,2,nba

I1TheInternet,tbh curry is likely the only guy i would watch go 1 11 and expect to hit the next shot every time ,7,nba
I1TheInternet,did you check literally the first page of google e or you know nbatickets com,0,nba
I1TheInternet,it not kinged automatically but you can kill backwards you cannot move backwards without killing tho ,1,gifs
I1TheInternet,yeah but apparently according to the other guy the response was logical which is just ridiculous ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,at least it adds to more than 1,12,nba
I1TheInternet,i feel like he would put up like 400 threes then,24,nba
I1TheInternet,superteam confirmed,-1,nba
I1TheInternet,that completely irrelevant to what i was saying tho like obviously being this salty is obviously dumb but after having come to the game to make kd feel as bad as possible and being told that you are not doing a good enough job of it do you multiply your efforts or not because regardless of whether they are still mad at kd after the comment or not they are in quite an awkward situation tbh ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,wait that not right draymond is not steve kerr he did not even play for the spurs ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,at least three,5,nba
I1TheInternet,thank,2,nba
I1TheInternet,tbh harden is not exactly immune to turnovers himself though he is shooting a solid 44 from the field ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,what do they even do at that point they were chanting cupcake but if they get louder they are giving kd what he is provoking then to while i would they do not they are proving his point ,-2,nba
I1TheInternet,tbh i think they went cold from in the restricted area even though it was wide open,1,nba
I1TheInternet,the bucks would too ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,hating curry is like hating evan turner dude would probably hang out with you if you asked and love every minute of it i imagine if you accidentally stepped on curry kicks at the club he would just take them off sign them give them to you and then moonwalk away with just goofy socks on as he smiled and gave you the call me signal ,11,nba
I1TheInternet,lol it seems to go 30 100 real quick if you read your whole comment as imperative rather than declarative even the last word ,1,nba
I1TheInternet, r me irl,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i mean sometimes i turn on my blinker and the person that would be behind me if i switched tries to pass and let me switch in behind so i switch in that accord sized space both to piss them off and because i was going to anyways and their effort is insufficient ,5,EngineeringPorn
I1TheInternet,draymond feels that he needs five extra minutes to score six points ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,and one block ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,in four minutes that a pretty solid pace tbh ,-11,nba
I1TheInternet,there was someone in the corner curry just threw it out of bounds ,4,nba
I1TheInternet,curry does have the passing skills to back it up ,31,nba
I1TheInternet, 4 min 1 mfw r nba is reactionary enough to automatically downvote just because they saw a bad curry pass rather than a good one ,-41,nba
I1TheInternet,definitely not the second since he already had a next ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,or let russ get the rebound and them hand it off for an assist ,3,nba
I1TheInternet, or made of limestone chalk tesla ,5,WTF
I1TheInternet,a bballbreakdown reference also nice story ,1,Justrolledintotheshop
I1TheInternet,that also how the clippers beat the spurs in the playoffs ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i cannot wait,2,gifs
I1TheInternet,so the frame rate that the human eye can see at is changing at this rate rate i will be able to see in super slowmo tomorrow ,10,gifs
I1TheInternet, so he could drop 35 instead of 55,137,nba
I1TheInternet,looked like he did considering how smooth the shot was and how slickly it went in ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,did you do the rick roll one because iirc that the latest version and it is sick ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,now all i have left to say is something about lan,3,nba
I1TheInternet,will a team to a ring just once when the team around him is meh and he carries it himself i personally will label him as top 10 15 a time because not a lot of players have done this despite a plethora of other accomplishments curry already had a first team and an mvp and all star selections but when he shows that he can be the team rather than be part of a team i would put him up there cp3 could potentially do it this season not because the clippers suck but because without cp3 i have reason to doubt they make the playoffs 65 chance imo and because every game he the one bailing us out kemba harden westbrook even butler also have that opportunity this season ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,everyone knows except you and op ,4,nba
I1TheInternet, yeah that i was going for 82 games and forgot to account for 8 losses but still somehow got 74 wins you know how test mistakes usually happen ,6,nba
I1TheInternet,inb4 38 0 for 74 8,12,nba
I1TheInternet,same with dj especially to start the season ,5,nba
I1TheInternet, and korver did not brick the three ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,not think about this none of them are real the real world is still imperfect and the first pictures are still the reality ,2,BeAmazed
I1TheInternet,legrange theorem where if someone is a better player their stats are better too ,16,nba
I1TheInternet,something something father son,-8,nba
I1TheInternet,i feel like thors would be more fitting given that you have to put warrior as well as thunder in the name ,2,nba
I1TheInternet, wonder why more people do not want to be referees i am down to be a ref for 200k yr tbh and i am preeety sure i am not alone satisfaction not guaranteed warranty void if opened restrictions apply batteries not included ,15,nba
I1TheInternet, but how much karma does he have ,3,nba
I1TheInternet,well some people go around saying communism is not the best form of government and expect not to be banned so ,2,videos
I1TheInternet,yeah but one would think that over a bunch of fans it would even out kind of like unu predicting a whole bunch of stuff ,2,nba
I1TheInternet, r michaelbaygifs ,3,interestingasfuck
I1TheInternet,what a classy slut,86,nba
I1TheInternet,doc is a gm too so that makes sense and thibs was hired just recently so i am guessing new caps and high average salaries and stuff have to do with it besides it not like he a horrible coach just not nearly as good as pop ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,makes sense might as well have said that the catapult is the superior siege weapon ,11,videos
I1TheInternet,because we need to know what we must not allow to distract us from what ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,inb4 clippers make the finals and are still clippers in the finals ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,the thunder blew a 3 1 lead to the warriors in the series just prior to the warriors choke ,3,nfl
I1TheInternet,also three touchdowns and one conversion in the fourth ,1,nfl
I1TheInternet,distract you from the fact that rafael nadal blew a 3 1 lead in the final set of the 2017 australian open,19,nba
I1TheInternet,my misuse of the word does not unlegitimize my point either but thanks for the correction i will use that to sound more informed later ,4,nba
I1TheInternet,it an r nba meme where someone mentions that the warriors new a 3 1 lead and then someone acts surprised and then people keep adding details about their regular season and first unanimous mvp and everyone acts like this is news used to happen like every thread but now it like once every two days or so ,1,sports
I1TheInternet,yeah i thought this was never done in the finals in history iirc they had the best regular season record of all time so i do not see how that would ever happen ,2,sports
I1TheInternet,the stats back it up over the 2013 14 14 15 and 15 16 seasons the teams that scored more points than their opponents went 3690 0 in the regular season that trend looks to continue this season too ,78,nba
I1TheInternet,eh i thought he was actually that good but it may be bias the point being is that curry is not the undisputed best of our time ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,oh aight i was just under the impression from earlier post game threads that parker is pretty much done and patty is not starter material despite being a solid bench guy ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i thought they had a pg problem ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,yeah the teams they play on are comparable but i also think he can get there if everything goes his way ,0,nba
I1TheInternet,does not illegitimize his arguments ,-1,nba
I1TheInternet,there is the i jury excuse but it does not work for the choke against the rockets otherwise i think his absence from the later rounds is justifiable ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i mean cp3 has a case and so does prime d rose if the player you choose can be in their prime depending on what you are looking for neither is better than curry right now tho though so far cp3 longevity absolutely demolishes steph ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,so he should get injured so he never lives up to his possible potential because who wants to see greatness develop amirite ,6,nba
I1TheInternet,well steph has had a year like last year and has won a title so it not like he doing something new so i think he can realistically attain that level that magic had in his career if the stars align but really not tho ,6,nba
I1TheInternet, porzingis not even a center and still a better center than horford lol,5,nba
I1TheInternet,who is that kid tho ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,but were they full retard ,7,nba
I1TheInternet,near triple double but still and amazing performance ,6,nba
I1TheInternet,i know i was just messing around i do not even hate the lakers ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,i know negative seven laker fans,-4,nba
I1TheInternet,you say both in that situation i mean me too thanks ,0,nba
I1TheInternet,how does his use of a word correlate with age ,1,nottheonion
I1TheInternet, lame car ,19,Wellthatsucks
I1TheInternet,he could learn to in a year or so he seems like a coachable guy with a decent basketball iq so i am sure he could learn to find guys when he learns how the offense flows ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,he could get there in like a year but right off the bat his and the spurs games are extremely different ,7,nba
I1TheInternet,we will take him for raymond felton ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,definitely deserves a max tbh,9,nba
I1TheInternet,to be fair that floating block last year was an absolute beauty,31,nba
I1TheInternet,i would guess by demanding time and attention which the parents could not get used to giving multiple persons at once also her preferences in life physical state attention span and learning style may have disagreed with the family limiting or making difficult the leisure activities conversations topic wise and food choices that the family had finally a lazy disposition or a poor set of views would make splitting the chore workload difficult from what i know well off families tend to have kids that actually work around the home and clean after themselves so if the adopted child was not used to that that would make it inconvenient to have them too things like this and other similar ones even if they are not actual huge issues could take a big toll on the adopters imo ,-1,AskReddit
I1TheInternet,i do not wish to defend the mother too much but it may be that she was quite supportive in life in general caring in stressful situations helpful in times of need of advice etc but simply lazy when it came to caring for the foster kids dumping the workload on op at least that what op made it look like so i mean it some abuse perhaps but there so little basis for judgement here ,3,AskReddit
I1TheInternet,i mean blake griffin literally clears the ground by like one inch when he goes up for a jumper but destroys the rim whilst dunking maybe andy just does not use his hops for blocking s,0,nba

I1TheInternet,lebron was the best player in the 2014 15 finals despite the 6 game l ,5,nba
I1TheInternet,will he be loved like lebron in cleveland if he comes back and wins one ,0,nba
I1TheInternet,whiteside had the single triple double with blocks twice last season ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,plays ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,you do not even know ,6,nba
I1TheInternet,he does not have minutes with the rest of the big four hence no stats to analyze and compare ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,give me some john wall game to go with that and you know i am watching that ,-5,nba
I1TheInternet,also y know his own talent the other two all stars on their team and the elite offensive schemes of steve kerr ,7,nba
I1TheInternet,cp3 can confirm ,6,nba
I1TheInternet,basically r relevantacountnamesshowingupatconvenienttimes,4,AskReddit
I1TheInternet,that a fair claim but when comparing them i would rather take the effort curry puts in over harden imo his defensive iq and effort compensate for fact that he gets out physicalled more than harden ability compensates for his lack of effort making me take defensive curry over defensive harden ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,youngsachii did and you seemed to agree seriously in terms of defense i will not say anything to defend him in that regard because i would probably lack supporting facts or be wrong ,1,nba
I1TheInternet,lol people were saying in the comments that ray allen was better in the last two seasons steph shut that argument up for good ,4,nba
I1TheInternet,well then maybe davis or kawhi or pg or giannis someone that can stack that fourth column besides if set up well enough i am sure whiteside could get 10 ast ,-1,nba
I1TheInternet,i understand that he does stat pad but i mean go all out not caring about that particular w just try to rack up the numbers if he passes to a teammate the teammate chucks it if there a remotely accessible rebound for him nobody touches that loser if he needs points they start running picks instead of cuts etc i am just wondering if he can get a 20 20 20 or how big his numbers could get despite probably ugly basketball ,4,nba
I1TheInternet,best player certainly not but to say he has not done jack sh t is enormously underselling him sure he may not be doing what he does in the best way and he may have been lucky to some extent to get there but considering what he means to his team what he does to defenses and how he changes his teammates game see eric gordon you cannot say he has no claim to mvp the stats alone i know they are not the best metric of performance cannot be ignored and value does not always equal talent sure he not my top pick but to pick steph over him just because steph is the better player overlooks harden accomplishments steph do not shine nearly as brightly no matter how fortunate he was to achieve them and i respectfully disagree with that selection ,2,nba
I1TheInternet,i mean all he did was get some historic statlines while leading a team without any all stars but himself to the fourth best record in the league and allowing its offense to absolutely dominate not much ,6,nba
I1TheInternet,true i would also like to have the whole thunder agree to allow westbrook and the heat to allow whiteside to actually stat pad for a game and see what they end up getting whiteside just might get a quadruple double if he gets his blocks in ,-9,nba
