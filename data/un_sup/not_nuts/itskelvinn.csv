itskelvinn,so youre telling me the resistance to gay right in the us had nothing to do with scripture what about the people trying to get the bible into science classrooms and charles darwin out or the hostility towards birth control and planned parenthood or what about missionaries being sent to africa with bibles and telling people who are being killed by aids that condoms and contraception is a sin you talk about churches being charitable there are many charitable organizations churches not paying taxes in the us leaves out over 70 billion dollars in the economy each year if it is a charity why does it devote 3 times as much of a percentage to operating costs than salvation army why are lavish buildings being made that close doors to homeless why are priests getting paid so much of the church income you also talk about progress without religion look at sweden look at lithuania look at norway there is a clear correlation between atheistic countries and low crime rates i know correlation doesnt mean causation but if you have a holy book that people believe is divine and it tells u to stone gays or punish women for sex then of course its gonna affect how people behave,1,worldnews

itskelvinn,it should be the higher they are in the table the first to throw,1,Darts
itskelvinn,yes,-1,Darts
itskelvinn,we might not have gotten reuben foster my point is there are so many variables in a team getting better that it cant be solved by just tanking the number one overall pick may not always have the best draft for example in my opinion the redskins had one of the best drafts this year if u tank the players dont have a championship mentality to win the only time i see tanking is reasonable is for franchise qbs like andrew luck or cam newton players like that come once a year maybe at the same time tanking doesnt even guarantee that dak prescott came in 4th round kirk cousins in the 3rd etc ,1,49ers
itskelvinn,getting solomon thomas reuben foster and extra draft picks for next year while only using your first and second round pick is better than getting myles garrett and whoever we wouldve taken at 33,2,49ers

itskelvinn,strawman i never said anything about religious people i said religion for centuries even now in some cases people believed the bible to be absolute fact and so when new ideas come up like heliocentric theory natural selection etc people deny science to stick to the old ancient beliefs even today there is a huge opposition to evolution in the us multiple sources show a third of americans deny evolution i am not saying all religious people do this this is the fundamental principle of religion which is belief to continue to believe in religious ideas you have to deny things that contradict them which in a lot of cases are scientifically proven ideas if they want to understand modern science better then that amazing mate ,0,space
itskelvinn,i am a rear gripper and my darts angle up for fun sometimes i throw as a front gripper and it makes it land horizontally maybe try scooting your grip backward if that does not work putting your wrist backward before you throw also helps if you look at mvg wrist his hand is bent pretty far back ps if you want the fishtail effect which i think helps with angling upward i have noticed i get it when i grip the dart tighter ,2,Darts

itskelvinn,this is called survivor bias it involves only looking at cases that are famous instead of looking at the entire sample size for example mark zuckerberg brad pitt and bill gates dropped out of school and are successful therefore i should not be worried if i drop out the bad logic here is that there are millions of drop outs that you arent considering they arent successful so u dont hear about them and those drop outs are likely working minimum wage jobs you cant just look at the famous and successful cases and draw assumptions or conclusions from there,3,49ers

itskelvinn,my grip has about 70 towards the back end of the barrel what i would do is hold my darts with my left thumb on that line so that my right thumb can easily grab the part next to my left thumb,1,Darts
itskelvinn,absolutely looks like i will add one extra ring of paint myself or something to mark where i will always hold it,2,Darts
itskelvinn,i ordered on the 11th despatched same day and i got it on the 20th,1,Darts
itskelvinn,i personally like the dark thunder more only thing is since the pattern is exactly the same throughout the dart i cannot find a sure way to hold it in the exact same way each time i was thinking i would remove the paint on everywhere except the last inch so i can use it as a marker any other ideas for this particular dart ,3,Darts
itskelvinn,they look really nice but for some reason they go very deep into my board im using 22 gram and not throwing that hard and it goes much deeper than when i throw my other darts im using winmau normal blade 5,1,Darts

itskelvinn,a 180 because 501 is a better game than cricket jk a whitehorse is definitely harder to do in my opinion as well although some people could argue a 180 is harder because you have to fit 3 darts into one area and have a risk of hitting the flight of your other dart or blocking the bed,2,Darts
