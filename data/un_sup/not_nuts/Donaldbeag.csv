Donaldbeag,from wikipedia millin is best remembered for playing the pipes whilst under fire during the d day landing in normandy 4 pipers had traditionally been used in battle by scottish and irish soldiers 5 however the use of bagpipes was restricted to rear areas by the time of the second world war by the british army lovat nevertheless ignored these orders and ordered millin then aged 21 to play when private millin demurred citing the regulations he recalled later lord lovat replied ah but that s the english war office you and i are both scottish and that doesn t apply he played highland laddie and the road to the isles as his comrades fell around him on sword beach 1 millin states that he later talked to captured german snipers who claimed they did not shoot at him because they thought he had gone mad,1,history

Donaldbeag,on the favored the defender point part of the advantage that the vikings enjoyed was that when they went on attack a boatload of men armed and armoured were able to attack very swiftly especially when those boats were able to attack up river the difficulty for the defender here is that they often didnt have the time to grab folk together get them equipped and respond during the early phases of the viking period in england the raiders would be gone and towns villages burning before local forces were albe to get there it was because of this that wessex in particular founded burghs walled towns that were able to hold off fast raiders until their own forces were ready to help ,9,history
Donaldbeag,the reason we have 32 councils in scotland is to ensure that local representation echos the views and requirements of the people they serve in the change to police scotland alot of local differences were removed and strathclyde polices enforced throughout and yet we still do have local bylaws that prevent criminalise behaviour in one part of the country that would be illegal in another ie it would be illegal for me to have a beer on glasgow green or wandering down sauchiehall street however the same behaviours would be fine in the meadows or on the royal mile just 50 miles away ,7,Scotland

Donaldbeag,im uncomfortable with the debates explicitly being seen to increase votes and coverage for minor players when they cannot operate on the scale of the platform you could effectively end up with labour scottish labour and welsh labour all standing there making the same points because they all have to toe the same line which seems counter productive and yet we know the various national leaders do have different policies and objectives the directions that carwen jones ruth davidson have are not the same as jeremy corbyn or theresa may so their opinions and policies will differ i agree it is a conundrum snp have to be involved as they are a major national player despite not being a whole uk party it is when you add in parties with wafer thin minorities of votes onto the same platform that it all becomes a bit silly ie plaid got 0 6 of the vote and greens 3 8 ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag, cherry picking policies that have been road tested in the devolved nations and applying them more broadly seems like a good idea to me honestly if this was adopted by the various governing bodies it would really showcase the benefits of devolution if something works somewhere else copy it i do not give a toss who thought of it first good ideas are good ideas unfortunately our various representative all think the others are uniquely evil so education reforms from england are uniformly binned here while proven examples of good legislation from holyrood fall on deaf ears at westminster ,2,Scotland

Donaldbeag,i think part of the complaint is that also ran diddies are given the full stage plaid are a good example here in the 2015 election they came third in wales with 3 seats welsh labour got 25 seats yet carwen jones is not part if this format however many would say is vastly more representative of welsh voters the current system of allowing non whole uk parties encourages those parties to speak as the voice of wales eg when the results have shown that they are nothing of the sort this means you may have the the greens going on about brighton or bristol but having no relevance or appeal by not standing candidates no reflection on policy to the vast majority of the electorate ,0,Scotland

Donaldbeag,no examples were asked at a core level of principal i agree with him upvotes for the adama quote but the army have not replace d the police force and are under the command of the police themselves only at key locations temporarily this has freed up more civilian police on the streets to do their jobs this has only been done twice before and the genie quickly went back in the bottle can anyone point to any waves of slaughter abuse or similar from the last two times they were deployed in this manner this should not be confused by comparing to the increase of threat level to critical critical means they have specific information to suspect an attack is imminent it has no bearing on whether troops are deployed or not the last time it was critical was just before the glasgow airport attack 2007 no troops were deployed then the last time troops were deployed was 2003 there was a plot to attack flight paths and they extended airport perimeters ,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag,ha no nothing of the sort small units if soldiers will be tasked to guard somewhere under police command they do guarding anyway there are no specialists largely thisis due to police putting all their armed police on the street drowning them in overtime and they need some time off switching in military personnel especially for static stuff frees up police ,5,Scotland

Donaldbeag,i see the drivers of the industrial and agricultural revolution and being similar improvements in ironwork and the capacity for entrepreneurs to make and market tools to improve work it a few generations down the line but being able to make iron plows harrows etc and knowing the benefits of crop rotation would eventually become being able to make a spinning jenny or steam engine ,1,history
Donaldbeag,yup union had power because the threat of withdrawal of labour expensive machines need to operate to meet thier costs the drop in capital heavy industries in the west has seen union relegated to state workers and are far far smaller in the private sector conditions during the industrial revolution improved due to parliamentary inquiries remember the birth of this was almost exclusively uk and were often charged by public outcry and church led moves for change of conditions which was later built on and became the anti slavery movement ,2,history
Donaldbeag,there are a few ways to look at this but essentially there were two known pre celtic waves into britian post ice age colonists of whom we have almost no cultural relics and then the beaker people named for a marked change in pottery and farming techniques that can be seen coming from europe i do not think it known whether this is a transfer of knowledge old people doing new things or completely new people doing new things this takes us from bronze age to iron age where part of the pan european celtic cultural traits start to be seen this state then continues until the post roman era who are not thought to have immigrated enough to change the population when it all goes mental we see a divergence of the p celtic britons welsh cornish and picts the incoming anglo saxons and the also incoming q celtic scots from northern ireland we then have norse immigration to limited areas of central northern england and many western costal parts in the 9th century before the norman normans came in the 11th so tdlr i would say cornish welsh who we rather insulting name with the saxon word for foreign and picts are the closest we know to the original britons ,1,history
Donaldbeag,the primary cause of ww1 was a horrendous case of imperial dick waving treaties that tied everyone in knots and stipulated dragging each other into expanding conflict and the whole lot living right next to the balkans a hotbed of rebellion and political unrest while kaiser wilhelms explicit aim was to for germany to rise and be an equal to britian shipbuilding and dreadnoughts being a good example this can never be seen as saying germany was at fault for ww1 all the pre 1914 regimes were culpable and the desire to blame germany i am looking at you france stems from a hit what have we done guilt from everyone involved ,1,history
Donaldbeag,it probably also worth boiling it down to germany putting faith in corporals to lead small troops and take tactical advantage while the allies favoured the broad swathe of combined arms creeping artillery barrage advance by battalion and mass tank use the point above of the allies being the one that had to olve attacking is the root tho ,1,history

Donaldbeag,there alot of spillover between arthuran legend and the romano british tribes of southern scotland they were paid off by the empire to be client kingdoms and keep order and be a buffer north of hadrian wall the oldest known british writing is a poem song called y goddodin which tells of 300 warriors riding from near edinburgh to catterick to attack the saxons in a verse commending one guys is says how great he is then goes but he was no arthur one of the earliest on the king lists is a guy called patronus of the red cloak almost certainly a former roman soldier officer so there was alot of to and fro i think arthur story lists 10 battles not all of which are against the saxons so would have required a heck of alot of travelling for a cornwall based warlord ,14,history

Donaldbeag,yes it is entirely conjecture it has already been stated that neither of the axis powers stated the behind every rock philosophy so to consider the later ops question were there any plans show us just how unfeasible an invasion of continental usa would have been d day remains the worlds largest operation of men and material a massive feat of arms to invade a hostile defended coast 30ish miles away and with naval and air superiority now try that trip for 3 000 miles contest air and sea in open water and attack an enemy the size of your home continent and entirely undamaged by the previous phases in the war it is all conjecture and counter factua l but once you look at the issues however many guns the civilian population can access becomes irrelevant as the proposition can be seen to be wholly achievable ,3,history
Donaldbeag,this proposition is just silly the primary obstacle to north america being invaded in ww2 is by whom germanys invasion of ussr showed the impossibility of subduing a continental power that can simply lose hundreds of miles of territory factories armies etc and replace them all with further supplies far away from the front line and that was a land invasion it is an order of magnitude harder to do everything with an amphibious assault and several thousand miles of supply chain realistically the only people who had the numbers to do so russia china were busy and or incapable whether or not the civilians were armed just is not a primary concern ,21,history

Donaldbeag,i have not said that there are none rather that there is a groupthink and a minority of poster that try to impose thier views on others just see today posts on the brain family or u b sod the majestic and u cenuij s posts decrying those that do not agree with them as cunts and tory cunts at that ,-4,Scotland
Donaldbeag,you are only allowed to make sweeping generalisations about the tories ,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag,why would you repeatedly assert that any decision here is due to bigotry there no evidence to back up your daft claims at least try to stick to the point,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag,police are crown servants not civil that makes all the difference once you start calling for insurrection ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag, although the next referendum has been discussed a lot i could not find anything about no voters that is largely because this is a bit of an echo chamber with the loudest voices asserting their majority and the wholesome rightness of thier views ,-4,Scotland
Donaldbeag,england has also moved away from the straight out of uni any grade any subject mould of teacher training selection they have a variety of measures to encourage older and non degree people to become teachers some of this has not worked an initiative to get soldiers in had numbers drop off after the initial deployment but they seem to want to try while in scotland there is a far more hidebound attitude ,5,Scotland
Donaldbeag,remember renewables are almost exclusivly electricity and most scottish houses are heated by gas we cannot satisfy winter heating demand from electric renewables without 1 huge increases and 2 changing the heating systems for theajority of scotland homes so gas is here to stay the question is where do we get it from ,4,Scotland
Donaldbeag,the way this is going that sounds like a no ,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag,i have heard this do not know if it an urban myth alternatively and in the same vein when they are selecting jurors spout off some extreme pro anti justice views and you l be skipped ie hang em and flog em or all propety is theft so there can be no theft either crackpot view will do ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,zepplins are on of my favourites too you see stories press releases every so often about airships coming back especially for commercial transport to wild places fitting wind turbines on mountains etc the combination of flexibility static airspeed and heavy lift could transform the way communities off the road networks operate but i am yet to see a practical product ,3,history
Donaldbeag,15 17 and that not portree harbour ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,apart from the fort too nicely looked after to be scotland ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag, but when disadvantaged students have to rely on student loans to part fund their way through university while wealthy students are funded from the bank of mum and dad it just a thinly veiled perk to keep middle class voters onside a scheme which disproportionately benefits the wealthy in society also sounds like our truly fucked housing market bank of mum and dad unearned income distortion prices rise by upto 140 in 10 years how much have wages risen since then north berwick most expensive seaside town for property http www bbc co uk news uk scotland scotland business 36398546,1,Scotland

Donaldbeag,better be careful with auto correct when describing hiploads of supplies ,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag, scottish gaelic is most common first language in highland and islands that just lies english by a massive majority is the most common first language its not even true on lewis ,5,unitedkingdom
Donaldbeag,i stated its equally likely ie is made up balls from those who have an axe to grind yet no data on the issue kids in p3 gaelic medium are not fluent in gaelic that just not how it works there are gm primaries in most of our cities nos so that part atleast is well established and on the are learning issue what he would be missing and have to catch uo to transfer is written english grammar but how much of that will a p3 pupil have done everything else is transferable there nothing particular about gaelic medium it just uses gaelic not a whole other approach of education ,3,unitedkingdom
Donaldbeag,nope they were offered two years post study and have had four their visa requirements are around 25k salary income for two adults and a child in four years they failed to do this so do not meet the criteria tugging heart strings and wheeling the kid in front of any available cameras does not change this ,3,unitedkingdom
Donaldbeag,the kids not a monglot he a native english speaker who does primary school in gaelic there is zero evidence that a native english speaker would be damaged by leaving gaelic education in fact after 2 or max3 years of exposure it is equally likely to suppose they would learn better in their native tongue rather than one they are still getting to grips with ,3,unitedkingdom
Donaldbeag,yeah might have a job being a tour guide in a distillery that is not built yet a part time job that might become permanent and only then would qualify to allow the family to stay income 25k i think great use of an archeology degree ,-1,unitedkingdom
Donaldbeag,it was on the daily politics pete wishart asked by jo coburn if he was confident everything ok with declared costs he did not want to say and had appeared to talk about conservatives rule breaking instead i think the link is in the thread too ,5,Scotland

Donaldbeag,i do not he was sitting on this just dug it up as searching everyone he has been digging into all parties returns following the conservative battlebus farce and found various mps from both lib dems and labour who have complained about the tories have done exactly the same thing themselves on friday there was a video of him chasing michael crick c4 reporter asking why his reports were only on tories when evidence shows they are all at it crick replies that cover the rest in a few days ,8,Scotland
Donaldbeag,like henry mcleish and the muddle not a fiddle ,5,Scotland
Donaldbeag,blog post contains links to local reporting of nicola flying into three constituencies during election campaign it states that these three have declared zero for transport in election expenses rules state a portion of cost be allocated to local spend yet declared figure is zero this is not snp bad its just further proof that all parties have been misusing expenses and the moves to report each other for criminal offences is idiotic ,7,Scotland
Donaldbeag,in the article it mentions that her husband is a snp mp so i expect she fairly well known to atleast one constituency ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,deserving of so many upvotes ,1,Edinburgh
Donaldbeag,yeah it stupendously bad law to garner headlines and virtue signal ie airwapons max power 12ft lbs are to be restricted yet any of us could go buy a crossbow commonly 150ft lbs with no restrictions its often said an airgun pellet to the eye etc could kill a crossbow bolt will punch through a couple of people ,-1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,firstly a toddler being murdered by a junkie with an airgun is more a reason to stop junkie murdering toddlers rather than blanket bannnng airguns for everyone secondly air weapon ammunition is typically lead pellets they could scarcely be more inert and if you had a handful of pellets the only way to self harm with them is to eat them the weapon it self has a chamber that expels compressed air to propel a pellet making one afe is literally as case of pointing at the floor and pulling the trigger then you just open the barrel lever ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,they did get an mep last time tho despite the great and the good resolutely stating scotland would vote ukip however a couple of years worth of the odious david cockburn may have cooled thst ardour ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag, and not just using the term agile as a euphemism for not under control that one of the best project quotes i have seen for a while and sums up quite a few programme directors i have met ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,this is the same project where the programme director sacked lots of staff then brought in indian guys using his own recruitment company a trip that earned him an estimated 10 000 per day bastard denial over scottish government it project conflict http www bbc co uk news uk scotland 35832028,15,Scotland
Donaldbeag,and radio active ww2 airplanes scrapped in a big hole,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,yup i have reported 4 hidden in the bushes by gypsy brae over the past 2 years you would think it would be cheaper to the map the good hiding places then check them during the day rather than running a fucking helicopter over from glasgow ,5,Edinburgh
Donaldbeag,sorry dude that is a shitter edinburgh is awash with twats stealing bikes and housebreaking for car keys at the moment north side especially police are useless too few of them and the repeat offenders they do catch just get let off mostly underage ,3,Edinburgh
Donaldbeag,this seems pretty tinfoil hat stuff the more likely reason being that all the uk national parties used the same method to count bussing activists etc as national rather than constituency expense all written up with expense declarations by guido http order order com 2016 05 16 labour battle bus not declared in local spending http order order com 2016 05 17 proof libdem battle bus did transport activists http order order com 2016 05 16 two more labour candidates didnt declare election buses http order order com 2016 05 13 cchqs battle bus guidance revealed ,3,Scotland

Donaldbeag,very much policy wonk garbage seems like snh and rspb are at excel handbags over the results too ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,this is a surprisingly hard thing to do we just do not have enough of a fishing fleet to have a market the best is clark brothers by musselburgh harbour so a bit of a trek if you are based in edinburgh but they have a huge range of very fresh and well presented seafood as will all fishmongers worth a call if you are after something special out of the ordinary as they can say if that stock it or who else to ask ,1,Edinburgh
Donaldbeag,want the absolute hell is this is she even from ni or just one ofour homegrown 90 minute bigots doing some overtime and the woman is only 25 and far too young to have experienced serious oppression and violence what an arsehole ,7,Scotland
Donaldbeag, unless we do not like the result then you plebs will vote again the right way as soon as possible ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,my father family were from ceylon and grandfather brother was in the regular army before the war and all through it he was in a balochi regiment meybe cavalry that was mostly pathan soldiers and they fought in north africa then the burma campaign like you i cannot find records for this as everything remained in india following independence whereas my grandfather started off in a volunteer regiment celanese rifles before moving to an indian army regiment and then a scottish one argyll and sutherlands,2,history
Donaldbeag,i heard al quaeda blew up trains in madrid are they campaigning for and independent catalonia now i think someone had misunderstood al andaluz ,6,Scotland
Donaldbeag,i really would not do anything like that one the phone it will take ages and cannot be resolved by a first line operator anyway write a letter the details will be on the fpn explaining whee you and your vehicle were on the date in question suggest they have the wrong vehicle owner and ask them to provide photographic proof a lteer will take you 10 mins 60p for a stamp far easier good luck ,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag,you have not included any risks to snp in the current term by the next election they will have been in power for nearly 15 years and how will we feel about wholly devovled sections ie education and healthcare then i really want to see nicola finally being transformative and leave a legacy rather than simply oppose everything that happens in england if former no voters are to be converted then we need to seen what long term cotland first governance can benefit the whole country we need to see change we need to see improvement we need to see better otherwise it give time and space for the others especially labour to finally get thier act together and being to return to the status quo ante ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,definitely recommend the canal to get you started linlithgow is a nice trip especially if you want to break up the cycle with a wandr round the palace loch etc before heading come and as said below falkirk wheel if you want to go alot further i would not recommend the bridge inn tho they have a bad habit if being really rude to cyclists since it was all done up either keep on going or cross over to the climbing centre for thier cafe ,3,Edinburgh
Donaldbeag,by all means check it out but you may find it is totally over subscribed my brother ended up emigrating to california as he could not get into a pgce here whereas it was no problem there ,3,Scotland
Donaldbeag,and irish home rule too there were concrete plans to devolve alot of power to dublin before ww1 intervened and we all know how that turned out ,3,Scotland
Donaldbeag,i am not a health economist and did not work on that study however a bit of googling tells me that 101 million prescriptions were used for our 5 million population and this cost 1 19bn for fy 2014 2015 that would come out at 10ish per prescription which sounds far too expensive for a flat charge http www isdscotland org health topics prescribing and medicines community dispensing prescription cost analysis they do say costs and volumes have increased by over a third which seems pretty steep should be good to know what nhs wales england experienced over the same period also who would havea type of thought asthma inhalers was the most expensive group 41m or that stomach acid prescriptions were the most common ,3,Edinburgh
Donaldbeag,a 2006 study showed prescriptions could be paid for in scotland with a 1 per item flat fee that avoids admin to deal with special groups and introduces a minimum payment so we do not get stupid stuff like ibuprofen above remember it costs 30p in a supermarket of your choice freebies in general encourage waste yet the govt waste cash on free prescriptions because it is seen as some daft talisman of how they are somehow better it is not they are not ps there will be some who say xx cannot afford it they need several items etc it 1 everyone anyone can afford that esp those for whom it would be lifesaving long term improving ,17,Edinburgh
Donaldbeag, but this is not about westminster it about scotland it truly amazes me how many morons fail to grasp this point ,11,Edinburgh

Donaldbeag,yeah a 500m tsx increase when your in year deficit is 9 5bn is just pissing in the wind we got over excited about raising just 1 20th of our over spend wtf ,10,Scotland
Donaldbeag,your view is driven far more by what you want to happen rather than logic ie you reckon a indy wo not go away because around 50 want it but will magically be resolved itlf it happens you still have the other 50 who do not have the same view right now indy is the main faultine in scotland labour tried to ignore it and got hammered cons would efend the union and referendum result and doubled thier msps the ones who really help cons are those who keep trying indy2 its giveca large part of the nation a reason to hold thier noses and vote con ,5,Scotland
Donaldbeag,yeah green will offer support to snp to pass budget but will use some wedge issues as a stick to best them with too i expect land reform to be a biggie greens very keen lots of snp members very keen snp govt not so much so they will want concrete propsala before anything ges signed off andy wightman major land reform campaigner was slelected green list in edin so we should hear alot from them ,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag,the echo chamber of popular culture has always been rahh boo tories yet they consistently poll 20 once the votes are counted ,0,Scotland
Donaldbeag,she is odious ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,nope swinney did the budget then and 2007 snp was far more a centrist party also i think they are referring above to the snps roots in the north east banff buchan gordon etc all been snp for nearly 40 years this was based on farming and fishing communities often against european regs which have destroyed traditional industries there again fishing and farming pretty different now ,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag,and they could have all voted for sarah boyack and then she would have won the seat you do not own the greens votes get over it ,3,Scotland
Donaldbeag,how many polls were there in edinburgh central i am guessing zero none of our parties spent cash on local polling so your point simply is not true alison had to stand somewhere and s a previous list msp and i think edinburgh councillor she had the highest profile there also a large student population tends to held greens ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,the highest of praise blue nun all round ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,ahh godwin law proof that the emptiest of vessels make the most noise ,3,Scotland
Donaldbeag,u think we had this in the 1st couple of parliaments when they had 7 msps they were well meaning and lovely people i am sure but their policies were ineffective bollocks and they subsequently lost all but 2 msps i reckon the same will happen again ,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag,wow really what about tommy sheridan and the swingers are they competing there too ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,yeah he a great candidate and will bring alot to holyrood ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,do you think snp owns the greens and their votes if the greens had all voted for labour the they would have won too maybe you should just left other folk vote for who they like best chucking toys out the pram when it does not go your preferred way and ordering them to voter better is not going to endear you to many ,2,Scotland
Donaldbeag,pull your head out of your arse they are not all ot to get you conservatives diloubling msps and becoming 2nd party is a biflg deal and reflects a shift in scot politics collapse of labour you will be hearing alot more about it over the next few weeks ,2,Scotland

Donaldbeag,winner ,1,Scotland
Donaldbeag,the guy is terrible and a real sign of the fact in scottish labour 1 i do not like hereditary mps just because your dad was there before you does not not mean you should 2 the guys is a coward who likes fancy titles but is terrified of real responsibility work he was lab deputy when lamont resigned and quit immediately he could have stood up and steadied thier ship to carry them through the process to elect a new leader he ran away that left lab with a lame duck interregnum of jim murphy before booting him and picking kez might have won them positive coverage but they are still haemorrhaging votes ,9,Scotland
