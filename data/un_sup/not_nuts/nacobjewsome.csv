nacobjewsome,parries are a little different using a shield weapon or even your bare hand you can press l2 to parry if you succeed the enemy will fall down then you can riposte by pressing r1 small shields are the easiest to parry with i would recommend getting the buckler or small leather shield to learn to parry with backstabs are initiated by pressing r1 right behind the enemy as for dodges they will pretty much always feel slower if you want the most bloodborne like experience use a fast weapon and wear no armor also up your agility it increases mainly with adaptability and much more slowly with attunement this helps with getting it to feel like bloodborne as well and it makes the game much easier also check if your the company of champions that a covenant that increases the damage enemies do and decreases how much you deal sorry if i explained too much lol i just enjoy trying to help edit lots of typos thanks mobile ,15,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,it not as tight and the graphics are not as good true but i would say still give it a shot however dark souls 3 is supposed to be on bloodbornes engine so bear that in mind ,1,DarkSouls2
nacobjewsome,it just takes some getting used to it not as responsive as bloodborne but it is older and it not the same game at all it still fantastic as different as it is bear with it a little bit it took me over a month to actually enjoy it now i play it almost as much as i play bloodborne ,32,bloodborne

nacobjewsome,i used to play destiny obsessively now the only thing that will ever make me come back to it is if a friend needs help or wants to noodle around in some strikes or patrol it a good game i do not hate it i just do not love it the way i used to ttk is when i started to lose interest the new weapons did not feel as tight and fun to me and the 1k yard stare meta is so much less fun than thorn tlw in my opinion i do not have a reason to hate this game i do not see a reason why anyone should it not bad it just not everyone cup of tea although should a new dlc come out i am definitely going to come back and give it a shot so long as it doesnt interfere with dark souls 3 ,1,DestinyTheGame

nacobjewsome,this exactly the best way to stop gender objectification in games is to bring no attention whatsoever to it the moment you start labeling characters because of their gender or giving them stereotypical traits is the moment when gender objectification becomes a problem bloodborne handles this perfectly another reason i love this game ,10,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,military veteran is awesome for first play through do not worry too much about blood tinge or arcane not many weapons use those go for a quality build strength and skill so you can use a bunch of the awesome weapons i would recommend trying out every weapon you pick up too if you do not have extra mats to upgrade it with take it to the first area and try it out on the mobs there bloodborne has a super diverse set of weapons and each one plays differently also do not worry about armor too much fashion souls is all that matters,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,in ng you can just level up as you go and be ok generally and killing the blood starved beast triggers a few world changes most notably causing snatchers to appear in cathedral ward ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,drangleic is my runway,2,DarkSouls2
nacobjewsome,i strongly prefer bloodborne aesthetic to dark souls ii mostly because bloodborne transitions make sense and the game does a good job of making you feel immersed beating mytha then taking an elevator from the top of earthen peek up to an iron castle surrounded by lava was completely immersion breaking regardless of how cool iron keep itself looks that just one example though ,6,DarkSouls2

nacobjewsome,if you are only going to be 2 handing the church pick thrust gems are the best you can get ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,blocking seems so out of place in a game that emphasizes aggression so much that what the rally system is for and i do not think i have ever ran out of bullets they do not seem very limited 20 parries is more than enough to take you through any part of the game if that is not enough there are runes to increase your capacity or you can sacrifice a small bit of health for more bullets and with strength or arcane builds you are better off using your bullets on things other than parries since they will do so little damage i do not see a problem with the bullets mechanic if anything an item or weapon that allows you to parry without any cost to limited resources would be horrifically unbalanced in a game where parrying is so easy ,8,bloodborne

nacobjewsome,yes physical gems are generall radial but you can get them in triangle waning or circle shapes and they will only fit on the corresponding shaped slot whereas droplets will go on any slot no matter the shape i hope that made sense i am kind sleepy lol,2,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,you need to get the pthumeru ihyll root chalice from the layer 2 boss of the great pthumeru ihyll chalice pwmf22gu is the best chalice for farming cursed physical up gems they are usually radials but i am fairly certain you can get off shapes too ,1,bloodborne

nacobjewsome,kirkhammer because it a giant hammer that stuns like everything and it so titties,2,bloodborne

nacobjewsome,this is a fine note,5,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,upper cathedral ward will always be special to me the choir is my favorite group and the atmosphere of upper cathedral is great it really does portray cosmic horror especially the music soothing hymn my ass it creepy as shit ,17,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,lanterns obviously ,10,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,when i first got it i looked at gameplay videos and said this does not look too hard just dodge them attack i died to the very first group of townsfolk probably 30 times before giving up for 8 months ,2,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i never fought amy legit i always waited until i was way overleveled lol,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i have not got there yet i hate the chalices too grindy for me ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i just hate the tracking on his legless attacks ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i forgot about ludwig i have only been able to beat him solo once he sucks so much but laurence did not give me any problems until his second phase i just fought him like cleric beast with aoe,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,the sharkfucks are the worst and the bloody crow sucks too but still not as much as sharkfucks ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i usually just bait the attack where he jumps and flies at you and then parry him but i know what you mean about not being able to get away he so quick charging at you ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,yeah he sucks and those damn wind attacks ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i actually find logarius pretty easy ebrietas gave me fits the first time though ,2,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,something something kosm ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i hate co op for the bosses because it like inevitable that my summon dies and then i am left with a double health boss to beat all by myself ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome, let the anger flow through you angry that how goddamn angry i am ,5,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,the goddamn dogs all the dogs any dog i do not care what dog i fucking hate their stunlocking asses they can fuck off ,34,bloodborne

nacobjewsome,ok sweet,2,huntersbell
nacobjewsome,mind helping with ludwig on ng i am by the nightmare church lantern password is 1314,1,huntersbell
nacobjewsome,i got dark souls 2 after about 350 hours in bloodborne my first dark souls game i thought the first few bosses were super easy and i hate the way everything feels so clunky particularly how it takes a year and a half to traverse a fog gate i did pick up dark souls 1 though since i heard it was superior and i loved it ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i have had papa guacamole get stuck in the statue in the center of the arena after he transforms it was strange and i felt like i was cheating,2,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,steve kerr actually ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,yes on ng 3 there was at least three times when i got orphan of kos even lower than that and died i nearly ripped my hair out,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,just a theory but since it seems that the nightmare realms are layered i believe these may be pillars supporting the waking world not too much solid evidence though ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,joy it just so fucking goofy and cracks me up ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,hmm i do not know maybe i am mistaken lol,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,you can summon valtr as soon as you join the league and equip the rune i have not crushed any vermin and can summon him but others like yamamura and henryk can only be summoned after you kill them ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,that about what i am at right now thrust gems are great too it becoming my favorite as well ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,alright cool thank you kindly ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome, leans against pole everyone obsessed with death ,14,skyrim
nacobjewsome,a hoonter must hoont,4,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,good tiger goes great with everything namely snake oil p,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,it was my first dark souls game after bloodborne i hate it still it feels so sluggish and was so easy for me i do like dark souls 1 though it feels better to me and dark souls 3 looks awesome almost like bloodborne with shields and plate armor definitely picking that one up ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome, hotdog hmm good observation ,2,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i remember all the 111 i got while ads with the last word and the range it used to have it was fun but so broken hawkmoon god bullet was sweet though,0,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,it was horribly unbalanced but i still had so much fun i would go back in a heartbeat if it meant i could enjoy the game the same way again ,1,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,maybe i am just wearing nostalgia goggles but everything in y1 was more fun to me pvp and pve both this game was all that i did but now i do not feel much of a reason to play i also do not really support the whole micro transaction thing it cool they make money and use it to fix stuff or whatever but it just does not feel right to me year 1 felt more like a game to me it was all about logging on and getting your friends together to raid or do nightfall now looking through the quests makes it feel like a laundry list but meh like i said nostalgia goggles i just miss it ,7,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,amelia is really the coolest fight for me i always look forward to fighting her the music the atmosphere the way she designed it all so cool her screams are blood curdling the one i really hate is micolash i hate running around trying to put him in a room and then beating on him then chasing him down again i always just cheese his second phase with poison knives because i fucking hate him ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,hail fellow west virginian ,2,IAmA
nacobjewsome,even the crow in hemwick ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome, here a wiki http bloodborne wiki fextralife com bloodborne wiki it not the greatest wiki in the world but it does have some helpful information just be wary of spoilers and if you need any help with anything feel free to ask a question on this reddit or go to r huntersbell for co op and if you have any questions for me i can answer them too best of luck to you ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,two guys walk into a bar the third one ducks 10069,1,pcmasterrace

nacobjewsome,it snows in texas but is in the 80 in west virginia ,1,mildlyinteresting
nacobjewsome,oh wow thank you that seems so obvious lol,2,applehelp
nacobjewsome,you have got a great shot buddy what a guess ,1,pcmasterrace
nacobjewsome,369,1,pcmasterrace
nacobjewsome,3369,1,pcmasterrace
nacobjewsome,hi,1,skyrim
nacobjewsome,the thing about bloodborne is that you kind of have to get good at dodging at least parrying is not a necessity if you want to try to cheese bosses from a range then maybe a blood tinge or arcane build but those are rough until late game and even then guns do not do much damage outside of the cannon and a select few off hand weapons the bowblade is good but you have to do the dlc to get it,2,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,that sick thanks friend,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,nah just run past them and up to the altar and interact with it it triggers a cutscene and then puts you in the next area by w lamp ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,that awesome do you have any clue where i could get one myself ,2,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,to die you should expect to die ,12,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,the meta is 100 120ish but you can still find stuff at your current level or even up to around 150 without being too op and ng can be great for a pvp centric character because it makes echo farming much easier just rush through to mergo loft middle and farm the pigs and shadows with the right runes you can get around 250 000 300 000 echoes for each run aside form that i would look at a guide to see if there anything you missed this should help http docs google com spreadsheets d 1evldm ywy9v8oaubvrhuxyti41enafga duqo4lowle edit gid 2077682358 also if you are serious about pvp you will want to dive into chalice dungeons for sure cursed rotted fetid chalice dungeons will become your best friends especially if you plan on maxing out your damage anyways i hope i helped happy hunting ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,you make it sound so easy lol anyways thanks for the help i really appreciate it,1,pcmasterrace
nacobjewsome,i will surely check that out then any tips for building a pc for the first time ever ,2,pcmasterrace
nacobjewsome,around 400 which is not that much in the computer world ,1,pcmasterrace
nacobjewsome,nah not really desperate just looking for a desktop to run it decently without having to sacrifice too much in terms of graphics i am really new to pc gaming so i apologize for my ignorance ,1,pcmasterrace
nacobjewsome,pizza cutter is perfectly viable with your stats but theres not much point in going beyond 25 skill id level strength to 40 or 50 though ,2,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i have not died to orphan of kos 40 times in a row on ng 4 willingly i can tell you that much still trying to get this bastard ,7,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,just circle him clockwise and always stay at his side or behind him in front of him is the worst place to be none of his attacks can reach his sides or behind him oh yeah fire paper and a beast blood pellet help tremendously so do pungent blood cocktails you can throw one in a corner to get some good damage ,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i would use blue elixir and sneak around the side and backstab him exit the cathedral so he resets rinse and repeat ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,you only get matched with people within a certain amount of levels as you the current level meta for pvp is 120 so people build characters around one or two stats and just a few attritubutes if you do not plan on pvp there not much of a reason to stick to the meta unless you just like having a specialized build or more of a challenge ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i am a snaaaakkkeeee,19,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,just hang back and wait for him to spew lava at you when he does run to his right side and get a few hits in also watch out for when he raises his left arm high up that attack has stupid tracking and he can hit you anywhere around him ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i am not sure if one is better than the other but bolt is what i used i am not sure of a good strategy other than do not panic dodge oh backstabs are great too once you learn his moves ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,bolt is effective therefore remember visceral attack,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,you may want to level yourself to around 60 70 maybe even 80 even though you get access to the dlc when you beat amelia it a pita to try it at a low level ,2,bloodborne

nacobjewsome,bring me the eyessssss,3,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,only use guides if you are really stuck and cannot progress figuring things out on your own is incredibly rewarding and well worth it but if you must know this wiki http bloodborne wiki fextralife com bloodborne wiki is a great place to go to find strategies for bosses weapon and gear info npc quest guides character builds and much more also if you ever need help with a boss r huntersbell is a great place to go it similar to destinylfg best of hunting to you edit punctuation and words,11,bloodborne

nacobjewsome,yes i am just not sure of what else i could do i cannot really figure out where i am going wrong or why what i am doing is not working and it starting to make me think i am just not good enough at the game and there no way to get better ,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i really do not want to quit though i have played the game religiously since i bought it on tuesday and i have done fairly well keeping my temper down and p avoiding rage quitting but i am starting to think that i am literally incapable of beating this lol and i really hate admitting defeat this bothers me,1,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,yeah but promptly got annihilated by two huge guys then i tried again and found some huge underground church looking place and got beat by some guy with a giant saw and a torch i just gave up and played a different game i guess bloodborne just is not for me lol,0,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,i guess i will give that a shot i suppose i also should have mentioned this is my first souls game i love the game so much but never in my life have i been so frustrated with a video game anyways thank you ,2,bloodborne
nacobjewsome,if everyone were on the same page as us the world would be much better ,2,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,asking all the important questions this is a serious matter and should be treated as such ,5,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,icrebreaker i bought it off xur and ever since i loved it so much it made me feel like i was finally good at the game simply because i had an exotic i spent forever just sitting in skywatch sniping every single thing that i could ,1,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,ok i was just wondering because i have a cat that is nearly identical to that one and i had no idea what breed it was lol thank you ,1,cats
nacobjewsome,what breed of cat is that ,2,cats
nacobjewsome,i started out almost the same as you i never really liked any shooter games and my favorite games prior to destiny were the elder scrolls games destiny was a very foreign thing to me for the most part but with the help of others and after countless hours of no lifing strikes all night i quickly learned the ins and outs of this game i started to raid and get better gear figured out all the currencies even started to really get into the lore it a great game very complex very unique it a ton of fun and i think that everyone should give the game a try if you ever want someone to play the game with add me on psn psn username is same as my reddit username ,1,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,what im from west virginia also ggot rekt by you in doubles skirmish not too long ago,1,DestinyTheGame

nacobjewsome,ok man that fine if you are really anxious then we can coordinate some commands somehow lol i am cool with waiting too though ,1,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,the only void primary is the epilogue sadly i have praedyths revenge and a void ldr a void deviant gravity but heavy ammo is scarce and im horrid at sniping ,1,DestinyTheGame

nacobjewsome,well i should be alright considering i have patience time 3 edit i forgot words somehow,1,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,if i could just get to xyur then i would be ecstatic lol after the crucible portion it does not seem as if it would be too difficult ,1,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,yeah that seems like the biggest problem hopefully that changes soon ,2,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,i would imagine not the thought of using atheon epilogue for anything at all makes me cringe and fusion rifles are meh ,1,DestinyTheGame

nacobjewsome,what is the best way to complete the crucible portion of the thorn bounty for someone as bad at pvp as me ,3,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,it kind of weird to expect someone to have all 331 maxed out weapons that early in end game the whole point of doing the vault of glass or any raid or strike for the most part in the first place is to get loot ,1,DestinyTheGame
nacobjewsome,i do remember it very well crouching behind cover taking every step so carefully peeking around corners and always making sure nothing was behind me i also remember being startled by the first hive encounter ,2,DestinyTheGame
