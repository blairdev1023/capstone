Thehelloman0,but the warriors faced injured teams those numbers do not take that into account the only seriously injured teams the lakers faced were the spurs and they still had duncan the warriors faced the blazers without their center that got them to the playoffs the jazz without their starting point guard and the spurs without by far our best player and our starting point guard ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,kevin love had a concussion last year,1,sports
Thehelloman0,no he was out game 5,1,sports
Thehelloman0,pace is also faster though,1,sports
Thehelloman0,because they played much better teams ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,the lakers only won 56 games in 2001 where they went on to have one of the most dominant post seasons of all time some teams coast in the regular season ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i would still find the lakers 2001 run more impressive if the warriors lost one honestly,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i get that but those people are not saying that the 2016 warriors are a bad team they are saying they choked which inherently means you are a good team the warriors fans interpret haters saying having the best regular season of all time does not matter if you did not win a championship as them saying the warriors team is bad ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,who they replaced zaza replacing bogut is the only real negative david west replaced mo speights who are similar level players javale mcgee replaced festus ezeli who i would say is an upgrade ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,both sides are being stupid bandwagon warriors fans who say stuff like that are pretending that the greatest regular season team of all time that was up 3 1 in the finals is not an amazing team people who say the second quote are usually salty ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if avery bradley was as tall as jr he would basically be a max contract player danny green is making more than bradley and his contract is a good deal and he worse ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah i agree they have only made two really great tv shows in my opinion bloodline and bojack horseman they have made a lot of good to decent shows like stranger things narcos house of cards daredevil kimmy schmidt master of none and some others but i think even amc has made more really great shows with mad men breaking bad and better call saul ,1,television
Thehelloman0, todd margaret netflix did not make that,1,television
Thehelloman0,it seems to me like they do not want to rely on shows that they have not made at all ,1,television
Thehelloman0,it still bad but nowhere near the atrocity that was witcher 1 combat ,1,Games
Thehelloman0,the point is that valve said they were doing one thing and they just outright lied about it they did not have to tie that bundle to the release of portal 2 but they did basically just so they could get more people to buy it that pretty freaking scummy ,3,Games
Thehelloman0,their playoff hopes were slim at best when cousins got there and the pelicans have one other guy that good and he gets injured a lot and the rest of their team still had lots of injuries ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,no way even if they went 100 percent all year there no way they would have a better record than the warriors ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i bet a huge amount i bet well over a million people bought a 3ds just to play pokemon ,1,Games
Thehelloman0,90s all stars big men would absolutely destroy the warriors big men they would have chuck hakeem robinson shaq and malone as their centers and power forwards oh yeah and they would have michael freaking jordan,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that exactly what me and my brother do too ,1,Games
Thehelloman0,wow i think you might be right even though i did it unintentionally i had red gold and silver ruby diamond never got black or white and cannot remember whether i got black 2 or white 2 ,1,Games
Thehelloman0,the spurs got crushed because by far our best player and our starting point guard got hurt that would happen most years if the same thing happened to any other 60 win team ,1,hockey
Thehelloman0,it like that the entire game honestly easily the most annoying main story of any pokemon game i have played ,1,pokemon
Thehelloman0,one thing that blows my mind is that the national dex is not even in sun and they got rid of triple and rotation battles double and single battles are better formats but it was nice having some more variety also yet another copy paste of the battle maison just in a different form was very disappointing ,2,Games
Thehelloman0,between x omega ruby and sun i would say sun runs the worst which is quite an accomplishment it crazy to me that they removed 3d and triple and rotation battles basically just because of the trainers and environment ,1,Games
Thehelloman0,completely agree the amount of cutscenes in sun was really annoying and made me not even finish the main story until last week and i have beaten every main pokemon game within a week or two of release except a few ,2,Games
Thehelloman0,red and blue are both ridiculously easy i played it again a few years ago and avoided wild pokemon as much as possible but tried to beat all the trainers i saw and had zero issues whatsoever diamond and pearl are much harder ,1,Games
Thehelloman0,joe ingles deserves a decent contract but i would not give redick or korver much more than 5 million a year they are old and i would be worried about them falling off a cliff redick played like shit in the playoffs this year maybe i am not giving him enough credit though ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i am not saying that duncan better or worse but you also have to account for hakeem playing on a much faster pace team than duncan hakeem rockets had about a 101 102 pace in his first six seasons duncan spurs had a about a pace of 89 90 in his first six seasons after those seasons the rockets played at a slower pace in 94 95 they had a pace of about 95 so it still a little faster than the spurs played when duncan was in his prime but not a big difference at all ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,you are just biased of course you are going to defend raptors legend hakeem olajuwon ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,shaq still scored a lot on incredible efficiency in 1996 though it just nobody but him and penny showed up ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he was good enough to hit the game winner over duncan in 2015 while dealing with an injury he a great player ,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,difference is kobe was far better than tony and tony was not even scoring efficiently in 2003 his ts in the playoffs was 46 8 that a much worse percentage than kobe ever had in the playoffs also kobe was almost a year older than tony in that year,1,nba
Thehelloman0,duncan had amazing longevity he was playing amazing against the clippers in the 2015 series he put up 27 11 on 11 16 shooting in game 7 hakeem was great for a long time too but not as long as duncan,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not know i think 2015 was the only recent year where something really surprising happened the reigning champ spurs lost in the first round and then the clippers choked a 3 1 lead to the rockets so in the last 6 years there been cavs 3 times heat 3 times warriors 3 times spurs 2 times and thunder 1 time that pretty boring the nhl has had penguins 2 times predators 1 time sharks 1 time blackhawks 2 times lightning 1 time kings 2 times rangers 1 time bruins 1 time and devils 1 time over that same period in the finals ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i know basically nothing about hockey but man the announcers were boring last night people find guys like jeff van gundy annoying but at least they are interesting to listen to ,2,hockey
Thehelloman0,westbrook only extended his contract by one year he does not have to stay in okc,1,nba
Thehelloman0,both games have been over with plenty of time left in the fourth quarter though,2,nba
Thehelloman0,what lebron gone to the finals every year for the last 5 years and in the west it was the warriors which were somewhat of a surprise but not really considering they won 67 games in 2015 before that it was the spurs who are perennial contenders and the thunder who were expected to become a dynasty ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,pretty sure he was joking,20,nba
Thehelloman0, though they could go down as the best dou to ever play the game maybe that possible but the odds are very slim ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i am not 100 sure that he did not know or if he ran away because they were going to begin treating him differently but i know he did not really get training on anything other than air bending before he froze himself ,1,television
Thehelloman0,i hope he sticks around on the mavs ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i think he just meant that book 3 half of the season was online ,1,television
Thehelloman0,aang did not even know he was the avatar until right before he froze himself though,2,television
Thehelloman0,i played with a kid that was super tall for his age and he got a lot worse after his growth spurt he lost all of his coordination and although he could hit for power his average was worse ,1,news
Thehelloman0,spurs were up there too won on either end of their threepeat and lost in 2000 first round because of duncan injury ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,cavs only lost by 19 last night nobody beats the cavs in a series by 20 every game ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah a huge majority of automotive jobs are around the detroit area still,3,nba
Thehelloman0,lol you guys can still lose this series you know that right ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,venture bros is amazing and easily the best adult swim show in my opinion,5,videos
Thehelloman0,it has the battle tree which is basically the battle maison it has the looker quest to get the ultra beasts but that only takes 2 3 hours and then you are done ,5,Games
Thehelloman0,all they have is the battle maison in or as copy pasted from x y the battle factory and pyramid were both awesome and it would have been fun to go through them plus the others ,2,Games
Thehelloman0,fainting a blissey at level 100 literally took about 30 seconds idk how they thought that game was okay to put out like that ,3,Games
Thehelloman0,why i loved x played a huge amount of time and they finally made it take not an obscene amount of time to breed perfect pokemon also i liked a lot of the pokemon they added in gen 6 ,4,Games
Thehelloman0,i love pokemon but all i want is a good post game there has not been a good one since black white 2 them not putting the battle frontier in or as was awful i would have played 200 hours more probably if they had it ,86,Games
Thehelloman0,not disagreeing with you but rodman was traded to the bulls because he was a locker room cancer on the spurs,2,nba
Thehelloman0,lebron got a huge amount of hate i think kd deserves more hate honestly because lebron was hated a lot more than durant for his move ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,wade was all nba first team the year before lebron joined and all nba second team the year lebron joined the only reason wade was second team was because that was rose mvp season and kobe was still balling 2010 2011 wade would probably be the best sg in the league right now ,7,nba
Thehelloman0,that would have helped the warriors considering curry steal of a contract,1,nba
Thehelloman0,klay has had a pretty bad post season offensively though ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i did not like that series because two of the best players got hurt,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if the cavs i hope they get blown out every game so that the league will never allow the cap to explode like it did again i am still hoping the warriors choke though ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,mike conley,12,nba
Thehelloman0,they could have one of their stars sit every game and they would probably still be favorites,7,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs shot 53 46 74 as a team over the entire series in 2014,13,nba
Thehelloman0,they would have lost in game 1 of the spurs series if kawhi did not go down,6,nba
Thehelloman0,their depth did not even get worse which is crazy bogut zaza but the difference is not that big especially since bogut is more prone to injury mcgee ezeli and west speights ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,wow those piece of shit fans trying to get by security,13,nba
Thehelloman0,yet another playoffs game over with plenty of time on the clock,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i definitely take kobe and shaq over durant and curry,14,nba
Thehelloman0,love has been great too,1,nba
Thehelloman0,you guys blew a 3 1 lead last year lol,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he clearly wacked his arm on one of the highlights,1,nba
Thehelloman0,has lebron tried a jump shot yet ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,shump drained his powers,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he has not been kerr took him out early in the first,1,nba
Thehelloman0,they called the same thing when zaza did it to kawhi,1,nba
Thehelloman0,manu did that in 2015 i think,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i know i am way behind but what the fuck was that blocking foul called on love at the 9 minute mark ,12,nba
Thehelloman0,the only way it good for his legacy is that he does not risk getting an injury that could have hampered him long term,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,duncan was a shell of himself in the 2016 season and then he hurt his knee around the all star break i think and was even worse just in 2015 duncan balled out against the clippers kawhi just got a lot better when duncan got worse ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,grizzlies are definitely better than the blazers imo healthy jazz would be better than the rockets but they were out hill and gobert was still hurt i would say that a toss up ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,exactly they have both not played super tough competition for most of their games ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,half of durant dunks were because of curry in game 1 and it was pretty obvious to me the cavs were not defending well though ,13,nba
Thehelloman0,and curry has had one game and a half against real competition,2,nba
Thehelloman0,with worse teammates and much better defense,5,nba
Thehelloman0,chuck saying whatever comes to mind is why he is employed and liked he regularly says women in san antonio are all fat,45,AskReddit
Thehelloman0,i disagree i think if you put a good point guard on the pistons he would shine ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,curry makes it so easy for his teammates to score it ridiculous you can easily argue he the second best player in the league ,94,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah pop himself said they never expected him to be this good hell he did not want to trade george hill for kawhi ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,to everyone saying kg had a better prime did he ever have as good of a playoffs as duncan did in 2003 the answer is no ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,mj did have a chance to have that narrative in 95 but he could not get his team to the finals,1,nba
Thehelloman0,duncan could have been coached by a bucket of sand and he would still be an all time great,3,nba
Thehelloman0,true but nobody really criticizes them for picking hakeem over jordan which is incredible,4,nba
Thehelloman0,you are right not sure why you are downvoted,6,nba
Thehelloman0,the way the warriors were guarding lamarcus after kawhi got hurt was ridiculous green was draped all over him and he could not get a foul i think we win game 1 if they actually called those fouls,6,nba
Thehelloman0,their depth did not change at all really zaza is not much worse than bogut west is better than mo javale is better than festus and they kept livingston and igoudala ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i watched some of the bruins series and both conference finals much more interesting games than the nba conference finals,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i think i might try to get into hockey,9,nba
Thehelloman0,i wish the nba would make the players follow the rules durant clearly just traveled there before starting his dribble and basically every player does that,6,nba
Thehelloman0,what in the world is williams doing played like crap all game,3,nba
Thehelloman0,kd actually played really well in 2012,10,nba
Thehelloman0,why are so many of you guys so douchey ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,thompson getting hacked and no foul,5,nba
Thehelloman0,durant does it worse than almost everyone else like it4 levels,1,nba
Thehelloman0,durant probably carries the most of anyone in the league,4,nba
Thehelloman0,holy shit what a pass,1,nba
Thehelloman0,curry giving durant such easy looks,1,nba
Thehelloman0,hate those fouls but crazy shot,12,nba
Thehelloman0,wtf is that lol gotta call a foul there,2,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs grizz overtime game was amazing,1,nba
Thehelloman0,duncan what is crazy is he could have been more dominant if he did not get hurt after our first title ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah the warriors really need to get it together there no way our 20 year old rookie should have had five steals in the last game ,20,nba
Thehelloman0,right but curry was very efficient considering his team and being a rookie,2,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi is not a below average passer ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,all would be extremely dominant,1,nba
Thehelloman0,fast linemen probably only have slightly slower 40 times than average nba players they are crazy athletic ,13,nba
Thehelloman0,football players are better athletes on average,-19,nba
Thehelloman0,yup he balled out against the spurs ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,he just saying it possible not likely if durant carries his teams to a three peat and a couple more companionships it possible he would be viewed as better than kobe,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he averaged 18 ppg his rookie year dude,22,nba
Thehelloman0,i think that just because they are so lax with the rules now,4,nba
Thehelloman0,2014 playoffs my family always loved watching the spurs and my dad has been a fan since the spurs were in the aba i never cared about basketball because i only played baseball but watching that finals series made me love watching basketball ,3,nba
Thehelloman0, kawhi on westbrook https m youtube com watch v y1o3pq0kyxq ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if you live with roommates it not that bad i would gladly trade a 60k salary in the midwest for a 110k salary in san francisco,1,nottheonion
Thehelloman0,it already unfair for the west is what i am saying though the warriors were traveling from oakland to new orleans in 2015 that 50 percent further than any east coast team can travel and a two hour time difference ,10,nba
Thehelloman0,i would take conley over lowry ,16,nba
Thehelloman0,memphis and new orleans are so close to the east coast i do not see big deal ,-37,nba
Thehelloman0,lol derozan looks exactly the same,70,nba
Thehelloman0,lebron did not win because they saw him playing with a far better second option in wade and he led his team to a worse record ,30,nba
Thehelloman0,dirk was not that amazing in the finals ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,some of that was because the cavs kept leaving him wide open though,1,nba
Thehelloman0,rose the dude won games ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,the issue is guys like lebron get paid the same as guys like horford get rid of this imbalance and the league probably becomes more boring though ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,castle wars is basically dead compared to how busy it used to be,8,runescape
Thehelloman0,holy shit that nets jersey looks awful are they really going to keep the color red instead of changing it to black ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that was actually funny because even though they did him dirty he was so happy about getting traded,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah because they started off the regular season on a tear they were reigning champs and had by far the best start to a season in nba history 24 0 ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,he said that all he talks about with kawhi is basketball stuff,9,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,that because they had the best regular season of all time,2,nba
Thehelloman0,true but i do not know how you can say kg team was much worse than duncan ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think that true robinson only played 23 mpg in the playoffs parker was only 20 and averaged 46 ts garnett teammates actually shot much better than duncan in the playoffs kg second and third leading scorers were sprewell and cassell averaging 19 8 and 16 6 ppg respectively duncan second and third leading scorers were parker and jackson averaging 14 7 and 12 8 respectively duncan had an amazing defender in bowen on his team but duncan offensive load was actually bigger than kg ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,kg averaged 24 14 5 on 51 ts that year duncan averaged 24 15 5 on 56 ts in 2003 kg averaged 23 13 4 on 51 ts shooting in the series he lost against the lakers duncan averaged 28 11 4 on 57 ts shooting when he eliminated the lakers the 2004 team was better because of malone though duncan averaged 28 16 5 on 60 ts against the mavs in the wcf and then 24 17 5 on 54 ts in the finals i do not think any playoffs kg had stacks up to duncan ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah i have just come to accept it i loathe the 10 30 games though i literally cannot watch any of the game if i go to bed at my normal time ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,because a fan should back up his team harden had some amazing games against the spurs hell harden had a 43 point game and people said he played poorly i put the blame of the game 6 blowout on d antoni as much as harden there was no reason harden should have been constantly defending gasol and aldridge post ups ,-2,nba
Thehelloman0,i think if the cavs get to play the game at the pace they want and can take advantage of the silly turnovers the warriors are known for they will take the series there no reason that a rookie should have had 5 steals in game 4 of the wcf ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if the warriors get to do that the spurs get to put cybernetic enhancements on robinson and duncan,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i get up at 6 watching games that late always makes me feel like shit the next day ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,why would a rockets fan say that ,-1,nba
Thehelloman0,tony is such a clutch player even this season he a big reason we managed to finish the grizzlies series in 6 games if he does not step up we probably have to play a game 7 ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,the narrative of this sub means nothing in the real world just last season everyone hated harden now pretty much nobody hates on him ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,what if lebron gets hurt but the cavs miraculously win ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i did not like them since their 2015 run lol no real reason they just piss me off for some reason ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i like pg13 more he a better defender and their numbers were similar this year even though paul george had to do more for his team i think if you put george onto a stacked team like this his shooting percentages would be crazy good he is less consistent than other stars though ,7,nba
Thehelloman0,basketball player says he wants to win,1,nba
Thehelloman0,my idea with this lineup was that 2 4 can all easily switch on the perimeter and all of them are great defenders big men are not that great right now who would you add demarcus cousins i would rather have another wing player ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,chris paul jimmy butler paul george kawhi leonard anthony davis,17,nba
Thehelloman0, because i am saying pop has the best system duncan was the system the first third of his career lol our offense was give the ball to duncan in the post ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,kg never had a playoffs as good as duncan did in 2003 ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,i hated that scene in the books because they were just complete morons for going back there it was obvious some shot was going to go down if they went back ,0,nba
Thehelloman0,no but i think playing an nba season is better for your development than rehabbing and practicing ,29,nba
Thehelloman0,the few games i watched he was not playing amazing but he just looked like a guy that could be a star down the line ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,it really randle third year i do not think a season where he played one game counts ,23,nba
Thehelloman0,dude what are you talking about kobe is the reason we did not win more championships in the early 2000s ,6,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,did you tell him that they are jewelry you put on your finger ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah i mean he went from a crappy coach to a great coach with a good front office ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,lowry and thomas both got hurt though,8,nba
Thehelloman0,most people before the season started said rockets would probably be 6 8 seed https www reddit com r nba comments 58zoju 201617 official rnba season predictions from the ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,nope i thought allen iverson was gonna be your favorite player lol,2,nba
Thehelloman0,just how much do you like cornrows ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,stockton had 2 points 7 assists and 5 turnovers lol,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i think rodman overrated later in his career he would give up on defense on purpose to go after rebounds ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i will never understand why people say whether they are male or female when posting on r pf ,5,PFJerk
Thehelloman0,if he was important for their drafting he amazing golden state drafting has been insanely good ,19,nba
Thehelloman0,two the blazers were 17 points ahead in game 3 of their series towards the end of the first half and the warriors would have almost certainly lost game 1 of the spurs series if kawhi did not get hurt 2 minutes after he left the court the warriors went on a 16 0 run ,1,hockey
Thehelloman0,if the warriors lose and kd does not play well his reputation will lower a lot ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,right now in my mind jordan is ahead lebron could catch up though ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,jimmy did not bring his account number and only said his last name for a reason i think he knew he would not get the money back ,1,betterCallSaul
Thehelloman0,well draymond got away with what should have been a flagrant in game 7 of the wcf pulling steven adams to the ground and he would have been ejected because it would have put him over the limit the warriors were also down at that point of the game why do not warriors fans talk about this ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,when i saw that at first i thought for sure that he threw it away,2,nba
Thehelloman0,that was clearly an offensive foul,1,nba
Thehelloman0,wtf was lebron thinking,3,nba
Thehelloman0,if the warriors win i really hope curry gets finals mvp he definitely deserved it over igoudala in 2015 imo ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i would absolutely love this but the money does not work out,2,nba
Thehelloman0,we will only have a good amount of space if pau does not use his player option which he probably will ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,derek anderson was hurt from the mavs series and he was actually pretty important that pales in comparison to the spurs being down kawhi and tony though kings did not have any real injuries this team had 55 wins and famously barely lost to the lakers the next year blazers did not have any serious injuries this team was also not much different than the team that got to the wcf the previous year compare that to a blazers team down the center that brought them to the playoffs and a jazz team with a hobbled gobert and george hill out ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,allen crabbe got 18 million a year patty is worth far more than 6 8 million ,2,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,the warriors would have lost some games for sure if the opposing teams did not have injuries they have played one game so far in the playoffs where an opponent team has not had a key player out ,1,hockey
Thehelloman0, iggy problems bogut injury and dray suspension were essential in cavs succes igoudala looks like he can barely play out there honestly he does not look like the same player ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,patty will get paid a lot and he just played like shit against our biggest opponent i like him but i would not want to give him the contract he will command ,10,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,he could very easily get mvp next season he will have to carry an even bigger load on offense next season considering tony will be out for a while if he comes back and ginobili might retire too ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,predators are actually the 8 seed,2,nba
Thehelloman0,nba is pretty boring compared to nhl honestly 2012 the kings won and now the predators are in the finals ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi averaged 27 7 4 on 52 45 93 while also being by far the best player on our team,5,nba
Thehelloman0,the warriors really need to stop playing such sloppy basketball or the cavs will seriously punish them for it there was no reason that dejounte murray should have had 5 steals this game ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,he got hit in the face you cannot do that to other players ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i hope he chokes like hell and lebron destroys him curry should play amazing though ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think that unreasonable it not like they faced stiff competition they have played one game so far where the other team did not have a significant player out ,0,nba
Thehelloman0,it a lot easier to be reasonable when you know you have basically no shot whatsoever of winning the series ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,parker was still able to be quick in spurts until he got hurt this season,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think so they played one game with the other team at full strength,4,nba
Thehelloman0,marc went to high school in memphis and he loved there why would he have left ,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,lol you are insane if you think that even a slightly realistic trade pg13 is one of the best players in the league ,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,yeah this sucks we may not have made to the wcf without him ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,cannot blame him much the way the nba is officiated doing that is basically encouraged simmons did foul him but if he did not overreact it might not have been called ,206,nba
Thehelloman0,just about any time he was defending aldridge in the post more specifically look at the first play in the fourth quarter he clearly fouls pau and nothing is called ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i am way behind because i was watching the predators but can anyone explain to me why draymond is allowed to put two hands on players when defending in the post he does it almost every time ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i remember so many dumb people saying the other team should have let him play anyway,1,nba
Thehelloman0,all of the teams the warriors played had significant injuries,1,nba
Thehelloman0,man i like mills but he is bad at passing into the post ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,our rookie just got an and one on the dpoy in transition,17,nba
Thehelloman0,we are out our starting point guard too it no surprise aldridge cannot get anything going considering we can barely pass it to him in the post,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yup he a great defender but some of the no calls he had on la this series have been pretty crazy,1,nba
Thehelloman0,hsas are an amazing retirement saving option because you do not pay taxes putting it in or taking it out if you use it for medical expenses if you pay for your medical expenses out of pocket you can reimburse yourself much later once it been sitting in the market a long time ,1,AdviceAnimals
Thehelloman0,lol he a two time mvp,4,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think so he pretty average he too short to be great ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,man i hate news like this because at first you think something big might happen but then i just remember that you get more money if you opt out in most cases ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,when we have simmons green and leonard on the court switching perfectly our perimeter defense is crazy good ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,that what op said though that he hates centers after him and loves centers before him ,8,nba
Thehelloman0,enes kanter has been saying this for a while ,41,worldnews
Thehelloman0,anyone who says that did not watch the spurs series,8,nba
Thehelloman0,everyone knows he 1 so he just forgot i think,17,nba
Thehelloman0,that true that guy was just exaggerating ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,for real kd could probably take a helicopter to the games,1,nba
Thehelloman0,man i would not want to live there because of the hot humid weather and i spent my summers in san antonio growing up,1,nba
Thehelloman0,a lot of the reason they are steamrolling their way through the playoffs is just because they got lucky blazers out nurkic who improved the blazers a ton jazz out hill and gobert probably still dealing with his injury spurs out parker and kawhi if kd was on any other team i can basically guarantee he would not have taken those games off against the blazers because they would need him but his team was so good that they can lose him and still sweep ,10,nba
Thehelloman0,he took the spot of one though,0,nba
Thehelloman0,i am talking about jerry west,3,nba
Thehelloman0,we have a good team and if we do not we draft an amazing player,4,nba
Thehelloman0,he got finals mvp because they voted before game 7 started we do not know for sure he gets it if they vote after they lost ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,gold can be just as volatile as stocks if you stuck all your money in gold in 1979 1980 it would have been an atrocious investment and you would have actually lost money the stock market has not done that over such a large time period in recent history ,5,explainlikeimfive
Thehelloman0,ginobili did score almost twice as much as lebron did in their last games lol,1,clevelandcavs
Thehelloman0,which was hilarious because the last two guys were both extremely healthy ,2,worldnews
Thehelloman0,they are going to continue the series sometime in the fall i think,13,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not know how you can think that considering their team would only improve a little bit and the spurs would improve a huge amount igoudala and west were good to great but prime manu and parker easily makes up for it jonathon simmons has not had issues cutting to the rim in this series how do you think tony and manu would do ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,ah i forgot that but he should have gotten another for pulling adams down by the arm in game 7 ,-1,nba
Thehelloman0,and kobe,4,nba
Thehelloman0,dude duncan averaged 16 rebounds per game against the mavs in 2003 and then averaged 17 rebounds per game against the nets in the finals he averaged 28 12 against the lakers with prime shaq the warriors would get demolished on the boards throw in pau gasol on that team and the warriors would be looking like the celtics this year in terms of rebounding ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,getting to the playoffs and getting the first pick is a successful season already celtics are in one of the best positions of any team in the league right now ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,jazz clippers was boring to me because i knew that neither team had a chance against the warriors with their injuries it was just a series to see who lost in the next round ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,because curry did not get injured,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i will always view that as karma for him not getting a flagrant for nut kicking steven adams,2,nba
Thehelloman0,tony allen was out and that it you are thinking of last year when the grizzlies had a huge amount of injuries ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,the best steak place i have ever been to if you get the t bone for two people they offer to cut it up for you every time,2,nba
Thehelloman0,duncan played so poorly in 2016 because he injured his knee again around the all star break ,8,nba
Thehelloman0,pau was never going to be very helpful against the warriors,1,nba
Thehelloman0,because one regular season game matters lol,1,nba
Thehelloman0,kobe carries shit teams to the playoffs his teams were worse than westbrook this year the man was ridiculous ,22,nba
Thehelloman0,jeez tough decision oh wait no it not lol,15,nba
Thehelloman0,lowry and hill both got hurt any team that loses their pg is going to see a big difference in offense ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi has hd weird injuries that are not indicative of getting more injuries,2,nba
Thehelloman0,this playoffs is just dumb between the two conferences probably one of the easiest passes to the finals ever ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,aldridge needs to step the fuck up i do not care if they double him consistently ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,kd has a huge wingspan and probably would have blocked mills,2,nba
Thehelloman0,v3rd3 ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,how fucking lucky can the warriors get our starting pg out by far our best player out and now a backup big gets hurt ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,clearly got his shoulder,2,nba
Thehelloman0,the thunder actually did about as well as expected the rockets vastly outperformed expectations though,12,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs had a legitimate chance at the warriors if our starting point guard and by far our best player did not get hurt ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,pg13 was easily the best player you guys faced,1,nba
Thehelloman0,man i cannot imagine embiid being a number 2 guy the dude averaged 20 ppg on 25 mpg obviously his points per minute will go down but the dude deserves to get a huge amount of looks ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,paul millsap could do all of those things too worse than draymond but he a very similar player ,17,nba
Thehelloman0,well what about the possibility of repartee at at t ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i would take c prime t mac pippen howard and harden are all amazing players ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,that happened to me right as i was walking into school one day had to go to the bathroom and wash it out ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah even though we are probably about to get swept if kawhi does not play i am glad i still get to see the spurs play ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,just show up on time work hard and make it known to your boss that you would like a full time job there after graduation i did not push my boss much about a job after graduating during my internships and kind of regretted it it took me about 3 months after graduation until i got my job ,24,nba
Thehelloman0,he played his senior year of high school i think it kind of messed up what his family did they probably cost him millions of dollars because he was so raw coming out of high school ,7,nba
Thehelloman0,giannis was 15 you can throw a lot of organizations under the bus with that logic ,6,nba
Thehelloman0, no bledsoe just sits for no reason for large chunks of the season the reason was so that they would lose more games,3,nba
Thehelloman0,electrical designing panels to control industrial machinery ,38,nba
Thehelloman0,jokic and clarkson are the only two taken after him that are better than him there also a lot of guys taken ahead of anderson that are worse players i would say the biggest steal of that draft was capela though getting a dj light guy at 25 is a big deal ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,nope i am salaried ,25,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah i feel like i cannot complain too much considering they pay me well if i lived closer to work it would not be a huge deal but waking up at 6 and not getting home until 6 sucks ,7,nba
Thehelloman0,it not that uncommon for engineers but they basically did it because things have not been going very well for the company recently what annoys me is that i was already at work for 9 hours a day and working 8 and a half hours a day so now i am going to be working 9 and a half hours a day ,63,nba
Thehelloman0,so my work announced yesterday that all engineers will be working 1 hour of mandatory overtime every day indefinitely i also live about 40 minutes away from work so goodbye being able to do anything during the week ever ,152,nba
Thehelloman0,anyone who watched the hawks series knows that schroder is a great player you guys made the right choice in my opinion going forward with him even if teague is a good player still ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,it was worth it to me but i liked the original trilogy a lot i still have not beaten it actually but i have got a solid 30 40 hours in the game ,3,PS4Deals
Thehelloman0,not much worse imo millsap is a beast ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i tried telling people this but last year duncan was not a huge impact he only played about 60 games and played 25 mpg he also had the worst offensive season of his career ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,duncan had some pretty awful games against the thunder last year it was not until the last game of the series when pop put all the old guys in that duncan finally had a good game ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,pretty sure in the regular season there was an article saying duncan still shows up pretty regularly ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i think the reason his offense dropped off a little this year is that reggie jackson only played 50 games and he was dealing with injury ish smith is a good passer but they do not have to respect his shooting so it way easier to guard drummond ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,reggie awesome hit clutch shots all the time but when his team looked like they were going to finally break through malice at the palace happened i love that he stuck with the pacers his whole career his commentating is alright i like that he does not drone on and on like hubie brown ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,suck what ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,which lebrons i would want a 2007 three 2013s and one 2017 lebron ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,it so that if you are a huge star you can get paid more if that was just the standard cap then mid level stars would be getting paid that huge contract as well which would make teams that sign those players a lot tougher to contend ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,they are really close i think john wall is overrated on defense though he was pretty bad against the celtics that may have been because of all the minutes he was playing i think wall beal might be better but like i said it really close ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i feel like giannis is one of the few guys in the league that actually has the right body to guard durant ,13,nba
Thehelloman0,i think people are also forgetting about his heart condition we do not know what he dealing with there ,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,harden he obviously already did that though with the way he creates so much contact drawing fouls now though if he can get his passing up to harden level he would be unstoppable ,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,too bad about splitter too if he did not keep getting hurt he a good traditional center ,17,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,dude just last year kd torched us,2,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,that the perfect team to stop small ball too because kawhi green and simmons can all switch easily,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,that not really true robinson and duncan were a terror early in his career but malik rose was duncan backup and duncan was playing 40 mpg ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,davis had 5 1 winshares and gobert had 6 davis averaged literally twice as many points per game than gobert ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,until cousins went to the pelicans their team was complete shit holiday was the only guy that was good and he missed 20 games solomin hill and e twaun moore are literally the only guys on his team that played almost the entire season besides him gobert had hayward johnson and ingles to play the majority of the season with him hill and favors played 50 games or so as for getting his team to the playoffs davis did exactly that in 2015 where he played far better than gobert did this playoffs ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,because he was on a far better team anthony davis is one of the best big men in the league at defense and worlds better at offense than gobert ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,pg13 is an amazing shooter though he gets much tougher looks than klay and shot only a little worse than klay ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he only averages 14 ppg though i did not realize his efficiency was that good this year i was mostly making my assessment off the playoffs games i would seen where he was blowing layups and only had a few good games there were other names that did not make sense too ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that metric has jae crowder at 19 lol,3,nba
Thehelloman0,lol dude you are just wrong the pelicans had good defense this year so yes davis does give you automatic good defense ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,rudy gobert is a great player but there no way he should have been so close to davis davis is much better ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,korver is 36 years old and has to constantly run on offense to get open i am not surprised he a bad defender ,11,nba
Thehelloman0,so many people wanted tony gone in this sub during the regular season they are nowhere to be seen after he turned it up in the playoffs people here are reactionary and you cannot give in to the negativity ,3,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,aldridge would probably play center ,3,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,just like kd should have played against portland right ,10,nba
Thehelloman0,two awesome passers with embiid would be crazy to see,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i dunno he a beast he only had 4 games to show his stuff in the playoffs but he was amazing he easily the best big man in the league too ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not know how people can think that in light of duncan 2003 post season better maybe much better no ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that was exactly my point,20,Games
Thehelloman0,you guys shut down mozgov admittedly this does not really matter much if at all and nick young also traded lou williams but that was the right decision you guys were not as blatant as the suns but were definitely tanking ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i would trust them with fallout because new vegas was way better than 3 in my opinion ,1,Games
Thehelloman0,embiid plays the whole season and is an mvp candidate ben simmons demolishes the rookie of the year awards sixers somehow upset the cavs and get to the finals where they lose to the spurs in an epic series this is my dream scenario also the lakers suck and the sixers get the number one pick ,0,nba
Thehelloman0,it a great game and the choices you make are more impactful than any rpg i have played that was not top down it definitely could have been better though ,7,Games
Thehelloman0, fallout new vegas is buggier than the fallouts and tes games developed by bethesda a friend of mine wanted to play it like a year ago an he could not because it crashed continuously anecdotes like that are not very useful new vegas crashed 3 times for me or so fallout 3 crashed 20 times and i had to use the console to progress through the main quest ,15,Games
Thehelloman0,they made the second round without brook lopez they were a good team ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,my friend was telling me that someone suggested the nhl make it so that your draft position is decided by how many goals you score after you are eliminated i thought it was a pretty good idea because if you are eliminated earlier you will have more games to play to score goals the issue with this is that teams would just start losing on purpose halfway through the season if they thought it was hopeless and then play hard after they got eliminated ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if embiid can stay healthy it was easily worth it,2,nba
Thehelloman0,if he cannot stay on the spurs i would like for him to go to the pelicans,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i hope lonzo balls out and disassociates himself from his dads bs,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i am more talking about nick young,3,nba
Thehelloman0,you guys went in the right direction trading cousins and got a good young player and a draft pick for it this draft class looks good and it looking up for sacramento ,8,kings
Thehelloman0,grizz spurs game 4 was amazing,3,nba
Thehelloman0,they have literally never moved up in the draft and have moved back more than they have kept their draft position,6,suns
Thehelloman0,yeah jaylen brown has easily been the best rookie in the playoffs very impressive performance from him ,3,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,pelicans just had some bad luck what with gordon and jrue having injury issues,2,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,portland did not have their starting center and utah did not have their starting point guard for 3 games ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,how about not playing nick young at the end of the season lol,1,nba
Thehelloman0,because shutting down good players to get the younger guys more playing time is not tanking lol,13,nba
Thehelloman0,i did not like jazz clippers because both sides had injuries could have been much more exciting ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,we do not know if kawhi is even back personally i hope we sit him the rest of the series so we do not risk his long term future ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,no he was not ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs grizz wiz celtics,3,nba
Thehelloman0,lol imagine if you bought tickets for game 2 ahead of time it would suck so much ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,pretty sure she a lesbian,2,nba
Thehelloman0,our only real playmaker left is ginobili,1,nba
Thehelloman0,good god this is sad we just isolated kyle anderson to end a quarter our rookie that barely played in the regular season is getting lots of minutes our best player so far is a guy making 500 k a year ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,thunder last year,1,nba
Thehelloman0,draymond gets away with lots of contact ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,hit his elbow ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol he said in pregame that zaza was not dirty which is it ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,simmons knows he playing for his contact next season he getting at least 10 million a year ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,gasol was a big help against the rockets ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,yup happened second half of last game too ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol fuck you it is not worse for you,1,nba
Thehelloman0,honestly fuck the nba for putting the injury in their ad,25,nba
Thehelloman0,kings trade looking good they were not going to do anything except maybe make the first or second round with cousins anyway ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,probably manu worst playoff moment ever i read an article where it says he was severely affected by it for months and everyone on the team kept trying to cheer him up ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,bill laimbeer is up there,27,nba
Thehelloman0,two draft picks if they lose the 2017 pick they also lose their 2019 first round pick ,13,nba
Thehelloman0,it was part of a trade deal the lakers have the pick top 3 protected ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,ah i looked up a random article and did not realize it was from january guess that giannis got a lot more sales after his all star appearance ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if the lakers do not get a top 3 pick their pick goes to the sixers they will also have to give up their 2019 pick if that happens ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,right but a 54 4 chance for your franchise to get completely fucked like the nets are right now is crazy ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,i like nick young do not know why he got so much crap he was playing good enough that the lakers stopped playing him so that they could keep losing i would be glad if the spurs signed him ,41,nba
Thehelloman0,the number of times he had two guys in front of him and he still converted the transition bucket was crazy he such a beast ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,paul george is the only guy i can think of,6,washingtonwizards
Thehelloman0,you are right but idk sometimes it seems like kawhi almost floats in the air when he shoots ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i would love to see millsap on the jazz ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,welcome to your nightmare bitch ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,holy shit you guys have him locked up for two more years at 1 5 million a year,1,nba
Thehelloman0,steph was 1st in sales and makes only 12 million a year porzingis is 7th and makes 4 million a year giannis is 14th and makes 3 million a year ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,pg13 defense is much better john wall was a liability on defense this series ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah i realized that after i posted whoops ,2,nba
Thehelloman0, the warriors draft pick is wrong saying that the spurs never drafted a bad player is sensationalist it about lottery picks and the author is correct the spurs have never made a big mistake on lottery picks two generational big men and a two time all star wing ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,lol how is hakeem not the rockets best pick because mj was drafted after him ,7,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah any player will have good chemistry with wall because players like getting good looks,21,nba
Thehelloman0,they posted him up two times in a row and he turned it over both times in the third or fourth lol,3,nba
Thehelloman0,it crazy to me that you are complaining about only having 1700 a month extra that what some people live on ,2,personalfinance
Thehelloman0,i get 14 days off a year not counting 8 holidays a year that considered pretty good for an entry level job in america ,1,personalfinance
Thehelloman0, 700 mo for a two bedroom in a decently large city is pretty cheap i am about to pay more than that for a one bedroom 10 minutes outside a similarly sized city ,2,personalfinance
Thehelloman0,that true when kawhi takes a midrange shot he definitely is in the air longer than most players,43,nba
Thehelloman0,send lebron some bad pizza,5,nba
Thehelloman0,the dude that beat shaq holy shit,7,nba
Thehelloman0,celtics still had a chance to win for sure but all the celtics fans acting like the rondo injury did not impact the series is delusional the bulls offense looked so much worse once he went down ,-5,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs obviously second would be lakers just do not send me the series the spurs lost lol ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,fixing the results is different from sending out the wrong envelope on accident ,15,nba
Thehelloman0,2019,18,nba
Thehelloman0,damn it you got me i called up david stern and forced him to give us tim duncan all it took was some churros ,78,nba
Thehelloman0,holy shit i did not realize the lakers had less than a 50 chance to keep their pick,115,nba
Thehelloman0,they doubled aldridge basically every time we posted him up and green played very physical defense on him parker was the reason we closed out the grizzlies in game 6 he only had one really bad game this whole postseason ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,it audited by a huge company no way they would risk their trustworthiness for this ,54,nba
Thehelloman0,obviously he had a better fg at the rim than almost all other players in his prime he a proven winner that came up clutch throughout his career ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,is this a new pasta ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,dude bruce bowen messed up vince carter career he purposely stomped on kobe hand he one of the dirtiest wing players in nba history ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,people take less shots when they are guarded by kawhi,1,nba
Thehelloman0,draymond a pretty great guy honestly he freaking out a lot less after he was fishing for that triple double he has never stat padded again and he seems like a nice guy off the court ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,the thing is zaza is a dirty player he has a history ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,lol and celtics fans wonder why they are hated all these shitty comments at the bottom of the thread ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,washington bench is trash and boston bench is one of the best in the league ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,our only guys that can really create for our team are parker kawhi ginobili and mills two of those guys were out one 39 years old and the other is a score first type of guy parker definitely could have made a difference ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that one that west drew was absolutely ridiculous,2,nba
Thehelloman0,if you think that kawhi cannot make a three point difference you are delusional,-5,warriors
Thehelloman0,i think he does a bad game 7 because you are completely gassed because of your awful bench does not prevent that ,11,nba
Thehelloman0,on top of this the celtics made wall with very hard on defense constantly fighting through screens ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,dj has played great when paul went down though ,29,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs should pick him up i know he old but i heard he beat mj 1 on 1,23,nba
Thehelloman0,the replay shown in the arena was a bad angle people at the game said,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think that was a comeback it just exactly what he was thinking ,24,nba
Thehelloman0,he a decent passer and good rebounder and defender but sucks at shooting,2,nba
Thehelloman0,the shot was an airball,1,nba
Thehelloman0,not surprised wall is not playing well the celtics have been making him fight over screens all night,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah it totally normal to jump to feet forward when you shoot a basketball right ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,gortat was grabbing browns arm on beal drive right before that,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol i think the wizards just committed like three or more pretty blatant uncalled fouls,2,nba
Thehelloman0,john wall is such a beast,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol bradley was fouling wall literally that whole time,4,nba
Thehelloman0,kieff was obviously scared to get an offensive foul there posting up horford,1,nba
Thehelloman0,only if the monstars drain their abilities,1,nba
Thehelloman0,this is a zaza pachulia level move cannot believe he will get away with this ,2,politics
Thehelloman0,that like some heat fan trying to make you watch that ray allen 3 do not do that shit ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i would say so avery johnson jersey is retired and he never got any big awards it was retired because he stuck with the team a long time was liked by the fans and hit a huge shot in the 1999 finals ,14,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,lol that bullshit our best player goes down and the warriors win by 2 and you think they would still win there no way in hell they go on that huge run with kawhi in ,0,nba
Thehelloman0,after kawhi went down the warriors doubled lma every time he got the ball and played very physical defense and the refs were letting them play we cannot abuse the warriors on the other side of the court the same way because of the way they play ,-2,nba
Thehelloman0,man he has a serious medical issue that will probably bother him for the rest of his life that shitty to make fun of ,8,nba
Thehelloman0,https www youtube com watch v goadxlgmdcu,5,nba
Thehelloman0,yup i will hate marcus smart for the rest of his career too ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,man i hate that the cavs got the 2 seed with 51 freaking wins they would have gotten the 4 seed at best in the west the east is such a joke compared to the west ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,lol dude how are ginobili and parker dirty ginobili a flopper but that not the same as being dirty parker has no rep whatsoever as a dirty player ,3,warriors
Thehelloman0,spurs fans like bowen a lot his jersey is in the rafters for a reason just do not like that he was a dirty player what he did to kobe was unacceptable tbh,33,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,guys do not downvote this guy just because of his flair ,3,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,lots of teams did that this season eric bledsoe did not play the last like 12 games of the season just so they would lose more nick young too should be good to see him back in action and be playing with ben ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,is embiid going to be able to play at the start of next season ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i think a big reason harden played so poorly was because he kept getting posted up by lma and gasol playing in the post tires you out quick,2,nba
Thehelloman0,he a nice guy that needs to grow some backbone,1,betterCallSaul
Thehelloman0,man i went to san francisco earlier this year and my friend i was with did not like seafood i was so pissed off that we only got to eat seafood once ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yup i think the biggest reason we lost besides curry going nuclear was draymond playing very physical defense on lamarcus and daring the refs to call him and they did not if the refs keep letting that physical defense happen we do not have a chance unless we do amazing on rebounding ,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,man i love getting a huge amount of food and i am a normal weight i just skip a meal afterwards usually,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yup reminds me of this restaurant on the riverwalk that relatives always want to go to during christmas casa rio it not bad but it definitely not good and it kind of expensive ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,man that reminds me of this indian restaurant grocery store i live near that literally does not have a menu ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah he was great against the rockets looked unplayable against the warriors tonight though ,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,seeing him freak out after he stepped on lee foot was terrible he was so frustrated him landing bad on zaza after that was awful ,4,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,that goaltending on the danny green putback and david west shoving pau and getting a call was ridiculous we had some calls go our way too though like the and 1 that dejounte got ,3,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,draymond was reaching when defending aldridge the entire second half it not surprising that he played so much worse when they were fouling him every other possession ,17,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,the players always try hard in the nba though it just that the coaches will purposely throw out terrible lineups it sucks to be eric bledsoe though i think what teams like that do is very unfair to good players on bad teams honestly the suns dnping him for 10 games straight at the end of the season was a disgrace ,1,todayilearned
Thehelloman0,i think the team subs are generally very bad everyone so biased on them it ridiculous i do not even go on the spurs sub very often because they are so biased ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not like him for putting ads on the jerseys,1,nba
Thehelloman0,beal for sure i think avery defense is overrated he obviously is a great hustler and good defender but he just too short to make a huge impact defensively in my opinion beal offense is better than avery ,0,nba
Thehelloman0,warriors are a much better team they have four players better than our second best player igoudala being hurt messes up their bench a lot ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,without kawhi yeah no shit,1,clevelandcavs
Thehelloman0,okc was definitely a better team than any team the cavs have played in the east but the rest of the teams are not that different imo that 2015 hawks team was pretty good and would have been a tougher series if sefolosha did not get injured probably still would have been a sweep though ,2,clevelandcavs
Thehelloman0,dude draymond was reaching the entire second half on every lma post up,1,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi is our only all star this year,20,nba
Thehelloman0,nobody was talking about the series everyone assumed we would lose game 2 i think ,1,warriors
Thehelloman0,people are not talking about us missing parker the only true playmakers left on our roster are mills and ginobili of course our offense goes to shit without kawhi ,1,warriors
Thehelloman0,regardless of whether that was intentional zaza is undoubtedly a dirty player,2,nba
Thehelloman0,you do realize this is the serious thread right ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,watching him drill those 3s after kawhi got injured was awful huge lead gone so quickly ,-9,nba
Thehelloman0,green will be remember for being a temperamental guy with an attitude but also the amazing defender he is people talk about bill laimbeer in a good light nowadays when he one of the dirtiest guys to step on an nba court ever ,15,nba
Thehelloman0,bowen was dirty but he was still a great player and defender,-28,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah he one of the dirtiest players in the league,5,nba
Thehelloman0,lol,2,nba
Thehelloman0,he played like shit tonight honestly,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah you are right about the thunder,-1,nba
Thehelloman0,you guys are lucky like it or not you guys have faced injured teams in the west for the last six series you have no control over it though,10,nba
Thehelloman0,not even close he was awful the first four games of the playoffs,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that was our good front office the stuff i am talking about the warriors had no control over ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,the warriors have not faced a fully healthy west team in the last two seasons ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,blows my mind how lucky the warriors are have not faced a healthy west team in the last two years and the cap explodes just in time for them to sign durant ,8,nba
Thehelloman0,no idea why livingston passed on to thompson there he had a great look,2,nba
Thehelloman0,you guys have not faced a full force west to in two seasons straight it crazy how lucky you guys are,1,nba
Thehelloman0,it a violation when it hits 15 lol,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i already hated him he did a really dirty play on kawhi either last season or the one before ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he rolled it on lee foot on the bench then pachulia on a contest,2,nba
Thehelloman0,d league,1,nba
Thehelloman0,slow mo ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,lol that was not a foul,2,nba
Thehelloman0,how are the warriors so lucky seriously when was the last time they played a series in the western conference without a big injury on the opposing team ,8,nba
Thehelloman0,fuck off trash fan,1,nba
Thehelloman0,take kawhi out we cannot risk his ankle,1,nba
Thehelloman0,just like we drew up,2,nba
Thehelloman0,curry is making some bad passes,2,nba
Thehelloman0,what the fuck lee,3,nba
Thehelloman0,that should not have been a shooting foul but i will take it,3,nba
Thehelloman0,pachulia just held paus arm there but whatever,3,nba
Thehelloman0,he pretty important to the hornets is not he ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,not for me,7,nba
Thehelloman0,great game even though the refs tried to make it suck game 7 should be awesome,2,nba
Thehelloman0,what the fuck,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he was open it looked like a play for thomas originally,1,nba
Thehelloman0,mr fourth quarter holy shit,4,nba
Thehelloman0,man the refs blow tonight another bad call,8,nba
Thehelloman0,fucking bullshit,1,nba
Thehelloman0,what a dumb play by smith,2,nba
Thehelloman0,man i loved playing that mod for tf2 years ago it was hilarious watching enemies not notice you ,25,LearnUselessTalents
Thehelloman0,the cavs went 11 15 to end the season that pretty awful for a team that should have gotten the first seed pretty easily ,36,nba
Thehelloman0,that information is actually incorrect because there no way you were accurate down to a millionth of a second when figuring out the time to train the skill ,4,2007scape
Thehelloman0,they clearly had no idea what they were doing with the balancing of some of the abilities the remnant vi missle went from 90 to 450 damage glad they are fixing it finally,75,Games
Thehelloman0,it northeast of varrock it will cost you 100 gold coins per log though,0,cincinnati
Thehelloman0,hey your second most recent championship is more recent than our second most recent at least ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah it would be boring if it only took us 4 games to beat the warriors,1,nba
Thehelloman0,they use a private plane which means once everyone there they will be in the air far faster than on a normal plane ,4,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,i do not understand those spurs fans shitting on green he shot great in the playoffs last year ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,they are based in hidalgo which is 5 hours from houston austin a lot closer ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,he probably just tried out for the spurs because he from texas we missed out on getting hassan ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,ariza played well,1,nba
Thehelloman0,we had to try to get all those offensive rebounds because if we did not the rockets would kill us in transition lots of times pau or lamarcus contesting the rebound gave the rest of the team an extra second or two to get back on defense it was a big deal for sure ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah i was worried every time we took a 3 because if the rockets rebounded it they would kill us in transition,1,nba
Thehelloman0,him and demarre carroll are pretty comparable and carroll got a contract the same length and about 5 million more a year everyone was talking about how the contract was a great deal for the spurs when he signed it ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he had a cold or something it was announced like five days ago or so,1,nba
Thehelloman0,green gave up a good amount of money but i do not think we could give simmons a fair contract unless our roster made some big changes ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,not true he killed us in the first half of the last game we played people were saying he had a bad game in game 3 when he had 43 points he can definitely compete in the playoffs ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,man i remember after he made that lazy pass and patty got the fastbreak layup harden was bitching at whoever he was trying to pass it to when he was bringing it up the court if harden had the mindset of beverley there no way the rockets go out like they did last night ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs won because of 3s in 2014 though a third of our field goal attempts were 3s and we shot 46 on them in the finals you have needed good shooting to win championships for a while now ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,we beat them in 2013 but yeah not the same team,7,nba
Thehelloman0,harden played terrible but a big part of that is because our gameplan was to post him up whenever he was defending pau or la which happened way too much the rockets should have adapted to it ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,man i respect beverly a lot after watching him this series he seems like he never gets tired and he always works hard he got more than one putback amongst our bigs perfect motor guy ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah once i saw harden was going to have to keep doing that i knew he would not have a good game it tires you out playing in the post,1,nba
Thehelloman0,murray with his parker impression love it ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,harden is a choker he did not take a shot the entire first quarter turned it over a bunch we posted up gasol and aldridge and it worked,1,nba
Thehelloman0,has aldridge been teaching murray fadeaways ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,we started off the game slow getting harden to switch into lma or gasol and posted him up ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he killed us driving in the first half of last game though,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that girl was probably just sleepy i bet,3,nba
Thehelloman0,that my rookie ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i think it official harden is a choker,3,nba
Thehelloman0,lol he clearly got green in the elbow shut up van gundy,3,nba
Thehelloman0,no wonder he gassed we are trying to have him defend pau or la a lot in the post,1,nba
Thehelloman0,you just have to get across before it changes to 15,2,nba
Thehelloman0,pau is a big time player,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i am still hoping tony comes back,1,nba
Thehelloman0,so glad for simmons but i will be sad to see him go when we cannot pay him in the off season,5,nba
Thehelloman0,rockets have a great young guy in capella he the perfect center going forward like dj,4,nba
Thehelloman0,i think the ewing effect is definitely a real real thing ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,all those seasons of danny messing up drives has finally paid off,3,nba
Thehelloman0,did the rockets just get rooked ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,wow terrible call,3,nba
Thehelloman0,speights barely played in the finals and he shot poorly barbosa did well though ,18,nba
Thehelloman0,our front court got bodied against the thunder duncan was basically useless in the series sadly and he was our only real center ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i did not watch last night game but i have seen most of the celtics two series and he definitely has not been making that many mistakes dejounte makes a defensive mistake every other possession it seems like ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,i found tatami galaxy extremely difficult to watch because the subtitles were so quick the dialogue in that is like twice as fast as most anime though ,1,videos
Thehelloman0,yeah he is not making mistakes like you would expect a rookie to ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,i am gonna do only non spurs because spurs would fill out my top 5 probably 1 paul george 2 john wall 3 russell westbrook 4 chris paul 5 anthony davis,1,nba
Thehelloman0,post game threads are terrible on r nba i mean just look at the shit show that is the wizards celtics post game thread,4,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah duncan was looking like he was declining fast in his mid 30s but then lost some weight and started playing much better most nba players do not have that much upper body strength just look at that picture of belinelli on that magazine for an example of how little some of those guys care about benching ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,the bugs are pretty crazy the game crashed a few times for me and the apex missions basically do not work for me half the time i accept the rewards after a team completes a mission the button i clicked never goes away which makes it extremely difficult to send the team to do more missions ,2,Games
Thehelloman0,animation like justice league would be much better in my opinion,1,television
Thehelloman0,drink as much as you can and yell belligerently at the screen is the best way to enjoy a basketball game in my opinion,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if you manage to not have gasol switch out on the perimeter he actually a good defensive player ,16,nba
Thehelloman0,jonathon simmons is the perfect guy to have harden guarding 1 on 1 he blew by him so easily during this game ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,this and grizz overtime game were both amazing ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,murray was consistently making mistakes on defense i think that why,201,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs and rockets form like voltron,6,nba
Thehelloman0,is danny green the best 2 guard in the league ,26,nba
Thehelloman0,2013 finals danny green up in this bitch,3,nba
Thehelloman0,v3rd3,1,nba
Thehelloman0,does the clear path foul exist ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he rolled his ankle or something,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if we win this game has been amazing if not i will be very sad,3,nba
Thehelloman0, d,2,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi is so obviously hurt fuck,7,nba
Thehelloman0,v3rd3 ,0,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi needs to step the fuck up,1,nba
Thehelloman0,obvious foul lol,1,nba
Thehelloman0,fuck yeah,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol that should have been a rip through,3,nba
Thehelloman0,it was not a travel lol,5,nba
Thehelloman0,people said this when osrs first came out and now old school is like 40 of runescape revenue so i definitely think you are wrong here ,1,runescape
Thehelloman0,not really a rav4 gets more than that in city driving a tahoe which has no real equivalent with electric cars right now has 15 21 the majority of cars sold are sedans which mostly get above 30 i drive a mazda 3 and my average mpg is 35 6,3,teslamotors
Thehelloman0,lol you are using a car that has like 18 mpg in your example,0,teslamotors
Thehelloman0,no disrespect to the preds i am a firm believer that nashville sweeping them is a huge fluke and robs the hawks of truly accomplishing what their capable of ,52,nba
Thehelloman0,true but the jazz had kd to deal with durant did not play in two games and played limited minutes in one game against the blazers also livingston did not play in 3 games against the blazers if healthy then yeah i do not think the blazers win one ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,kyrie is not shooting well but he racking up lots of assists averaged 9 game against the raptors ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,had the blazers had nurkic i definitely think they could have beaten you guys once or maybe even twice ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,pau disappointed he not been amazing but he definitely been good patty sad dedmon not surprised but disappointed manu perplexed and mortified if he went to the sixers or something to help out a young team it would make it hurt less lee disappointed he been a big help on the bench and his contract is dirt cheap ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,dude what are you talking about rondo only played two games in the playoffs and butler stats dropped across the board after rondo went out ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,butler was calling his team out in the regular season as well though lol,3,nba
Thehelloman0,it not like it that great it better than mcdonald and burger king but it nothing amazing ,-5,todayilearned
Thehelloman0,that is true he would definitely have to listen to pop looking at how rondo worked out in dallas it might not be the best idea ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if rondo came that would be awesome he would probably be underpaid and dejounte would have another hall of fame guard to learn from ,7,nba
Thehelloman0,all fanbases have guys like that though so many spurs fans shat all over parker during the regular season but honestly without him we could have lost to the grizzlies i remember so many trade parker threads after he had a bad game it was ridiculous i would want parker on the books even if he was playing like dogshit he a legend ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,i mean i would be surprised if any team except the warriors lost their two best players and managed to get out of the first round,3,nba
Thehelloman0,over an entire lifetime that would be easy to make,3,nba

Thehelloman0,if you made minimum wage full time for 30 years that 480k i do not think it a very hard thing to ask them to make on average about 50 more than minimum wage right now over their entire careers ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,karl malone won mvp his 14th year,15,nba
Thehelloman0,mlb the show blows nba 2k out of the water in my opinion,21,nba
Thehelloman0,mike conley is also super nice and has won the sportsmanship award twice ,254,nba
Thehelloman0,no i am saying his kids need to have lots of kids,79,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah i think he would be able to ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,if he gets busy and his kids get busy it definitely doable though if he has 4 kids and his 4 kids have 4 kids each that 21 people to pool money from that less than 700 000 a person which would not be very difficult to do ,70,nba
Thehelloman0,they would be great just move lebron kyrie love smith and thompson to the bench ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi complains too he just always gets back on defense right away if he has to ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i definitely noticed him getting fouled without calls when i was watching same thing happens to all players though ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,cory joseph if you mean a player that was never on my team then paul george probably ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,no chance he barely got the cavs to the top 2 in the east a worse conference with better teammates ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i have never bought bonds because i would rather just pay real money for membership everything goes faster if you are a member but i would just stay free until you get a handle on the game once you feel restricted then buy a bond ,1,runescape
Thehelloman0,fyi at a low level it will probably take you at least 10 hours to get a bond which lets you be a member for only two weeks ,1,runescape
Thehelloman0,who the best transition player in the league because john wall is definitely up there he nearly unstoppable,2,nba
Thehelloman0,people that bring that up also do not bring up that love had to go through concussion protocol in 2016,3,nba
Thehelloman0,his bench is insanely bad and even his starters are put together poorly even though there some good players ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,that just the type of games those two are you should not have been surprised considering how the previous entries in their series were ,1,Games
Thehelloman0,the nba does not give a shit it been like this for a very long time,4,nba
Thehelloman0,if they get hot from 3 they can beat any team in the league the odds of that happening for a whole series are pretty low i think though ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,he took da plej,2,nba
Thehelloman0,he just saying that his team was good and it was very good after he retired the first time his team lost in the second round in 7 games to ewing knicks that extremely good for a team losing the best player ever ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,karl malone did that just as well as those guys and he played very recently,2,nba
Thehelloman0,two things he did not play very many minutes and was out there only for defense also he was a really nice guy he donated almost all of his money he made to sudan ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,we got swept by the suns in 2010,5,nba

Thehelloman0,you choose what funds to put your 401k into you either had very little money in the account to begin with or had it in an extremely risky fund if you put it in a fund like vstax there no way you would have lost more than a little over half by 2008 ,1,personalfinance
Thehelloman0,do not see a foul there tbh,-2,nba

Thehelloman0,yup people are saying harden had a bad game when he got 43 points,1,nba
Thehelloman0,honestly the rockets thunder series was extremely boring the narrative was good but there was an insane amount of fts taken in that series the rockets took 168 fts and the thunder took 135 compare that to the jazz clippers series where the jazz took 163 fts and the clippers took 168 in two more freaking games spurs grizzlies the spurs took 149 fta and the grizzlies took 122 in one more game ,29,nba

Thehelloman0,this division of the oculus rift part of their company is most certainly not 4 of their market cap,-1,technology
Thehelloman0,as far as i can tell the best possible thing to do would be to force teams to announce possible rest days around when the season starts if the team did not announce a rest day for a player by that deadline they have to play them if they are completely healthy idk why i got downvoted i am just trying to suggest a solution that meets in the middle for the fans and the owners ,-7,nba
Thehelloman0,you did not even have to read the article to realize that you are wrong lol,1,technology
Thehelloman0,yeah i was disappointed when they removed it from pokemon also smt4 had decent 3d,57,Games
Thehelloman0,i think it because it happened to a spurs player known to be a great guy for seemingly no reason throw that on top of him being one of the most prolific floppers in the league he will have a lot of guys hating on him of those guys you listed jr smith is definitely known to be a hothead i mean the knicks purposely got rid of him because of how he behaved ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol if lebron died the east would suck so bad it would be hilarious,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i will forever hate smart as long as he in the league dude nutpunched the most beloved spurs roleplayer of all time ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,horford an awesome guy always positive on the court has great sportsmanship and he was the only one keeping the celtics in the game in the second quarter last night ,7,nba

Thehelloman0,you are also ignoring that love had to go through concussion protocol in 2016,1,nba
Thehelloman0,because fans of other teams that are in the playoffs exist ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah i mean who would really take 2014 bosh over duncan duncan is a proven winner that steps up in the playoffs just the previous year he was a monster in the playoffs and completely outplayed bosh ,1,nba

Thehelloman0,i never thought light was on the right i was hoping l would catch him from the moment he was introduced,2,AskReddit
Thehelloman0,parker has played more games than almost anyone in the league he played more professional games than vince carter if you count his european games the guy has an insane amount of mileage on him and his game relies on quickness that this injury will affect ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,mlb the show is pretty great,2,nba
Thehelloman0, here http www basketball reference com boxscores 200912040lal html is the game,2,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs definitely had a few calls go their way there were two soft fouls called against beverley that i remember patty flop when he was guarding harden i am sure there were others but anyway if you want to see how bad refs can be just watch the ncaa championship game from this year nba refs are the best in the business even if we complain about them all the time ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,why did this have to happen tony was shutting up all of his haters this postseason ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,were people saying this it was obvious watching hawks games that dwight was doing whatever his team needed,1,nba
Thehelloman0, you mean back then cause they surely were not contenders back then i am talking about right now wtf are you talking about the 2015 spurs were extremely similar to the 2014 championship spurs this is complete revisionist history ,3,nba
Thehelloman0, illmatic was a curse for nas career nothing he ever did came close to the brilliance of that album i disagree i listen to it was written more than illmatic in my mind they are about equals and both amazing albums ,1,hiphopheads

Thehelloman0,acting like that an obvious fact is pretty silly duncan had one of the biggest carry jobs ever in 2003 kobe and duncan should be ranked right near eachother but it definitely not clear who better ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,that team was good enough that after mj left they made the second round and took ewing knicks to 7 games,2,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah the way wall was playing it crazy that the wizards lost if beal just played below average instead of like crap the game never would have gone to overtime ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think people get that over the entire regular season anyone on the spurs got at least 10 assists 3 times parker had 12 and patty had 10 twice that it ,11,nba
Thehelloman0,harden was awesome to watch in game 1 he nearly on a chris paul level of passing but way better at driving to the rim if he not drawing bs fouls which does not happen nearly as often as people say it does he one of the most exciting players in the league ,3,rockets
Thehelloman0,rockets are a great team at any time they can spark a big run and if you let them dictate the pace they will outscore you this was a very hard fought game and the rockets were always in it until that huge room at the end of the game hopefully we will be able to steal one on the road in the next two games ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,tony played much better tonight and in game 6 of the grizzlies series though,3,nba
Thehelloman0,he shot poorly but i do not think he played badly otherwise he played decent defense and made quite a few impressive passes ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i am definitely not lying to myself,2,nba
Thehelloman0,what a terrible foul ginobili ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,green had definitely gotten better at driving he still not good but he not absolutely awful anymore,1,nba

Thehelloman0,that basically curry career average,3,nba
Thehelloman0,because going back a few weeks and making fun of people for their guesses when you know the result is just silly the original commentor is silly for acting like he not wrong but it just pisses me off like when people made fun of everyone in the post game thread after the warriors went up 3 1 that kind of comeback was unprecedented so people assumed the series was over i guarantee most of the people making fun of people in that thread thought the warriors were going to win the series after that game too ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,god i hate when people go back and make fun of people after the fact ,-6,nba
Thehelloman0,john wall isaiah thomas rarely makes bad passes and is great at kicking out if he does not get a good look on drives but he just does not set up his teammates the way wall does ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah warriors fans complain about this a lot but people get fouled off ball all the time in the playoffs and it rarely gets called,-5,nba
Thehelloman0, if there no ring people wo not remember the season that well you are crazy if you think people wo not remember the year that a third year player got mvp constantly led his teams to victories and had a freaking rule created because he was so good so young ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,yup which leads to bad defense on him which leads to easy shots,1,nba
Thehelloman0,looked to me like gortat hit isaiah arm on the drive,2,nba
Thehelloman0,lol foul on horford awful call,7,nba
Thehelloman0,but people started posting serious post game discussion threads during the regular season,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that was almost extremely impressive,1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah it was a good no call,4,nba
Thehelloman0,fuck smart,3,nba
Thehelloman0,that 4v4 thing pretty rarely happened kawhi is still a good defender but his defense definitely dropped this season he approached defense a little bit more like paul george this season where he will turn it on if he really needs to but does not try that hard all the time ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,idk why you got downvoted i completely agree with you ,2,nba

Thehelloman0,probably the ray allen 3 but chris paul hitting the game winner in 2015 over duncan was awful ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi had 21 points on 14 shots with 11 rebounds and 6 assists with only 1 turnover it was not a good game from him but he did not not show up ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,tony great i mean just a few days ago at 34 almost 35 years old he was easily the second best player for the spurs and played about as good as kawhi putting up 27 points on 14 shots with 4 assists and 1 turnover he so unappreciated by spurs fans it ridiculous even during the regular season he would pretty often come up clutch at the end of games sure he could not get it done every night like he used to but he certainly was not the absolute garbage a lot of spurs fans said he was ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i wish derrick was still great,1,nba
Thehelloman0,not anymore but people were saying that last year for sure ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi did play defense worse this year but do you seriously think that he suddenly one of the worst 3 point defenders in the league look at the graph in this article http fansided com 2017 03 16 nylon calculus missed 3 pointers ruining kawhi leonard defensive numbers also you have to keep in mind that kawhi played a lot of minutes with parker who a bad defender and aldridge who is bad at defending 3s if switched on the perimeter ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,when kawhi was on the floor teams hit 3 pointers at a much higher rate than usual part of it basically boiled down to bad luck i also do not know how you could think that if you watched the grizzlies series ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i am lost can you give my directions to my house ,18,nba
Thehelloman0,because the jazz are good warriors should still beat them handily but they are a good team i would say i am looking forward to watching them tonight but unfortunately the game starts past my bedtime and i am only willing to feel like crap the next day to watch the spurs ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,tony has played significant minutes for the spurs since he was 19 manu came in and was good much faster than parker that why parker had five games with negative game scores in the 2003 championship run for an example of his younger years messing him up in this stat ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i enjoy the story but i approach it like a cheesy game and laugh when the writing is bad i am not emotionally invested in it but it fun to play through liam companion quest was hilarious,7,Games
Thehelloman0,yes aldridge is awful at defending guys on the perimeter ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,he probably been at his job for less than a year ,3,personalfinance
Thehelloman0,i disagree our starters are not great but our bench is still good lee mills gasol ginobili and anderson are all good to serviceable bench players ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,do you seriously think aldridge was playing at his normal level he was the worst player on the court green was missing wide open shots parker was getting blocked half the time he drove etc kawhi was the only guy that could generate offense on our team ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,who is even going to be a free agent cp3 i would love to have him but we do not have enough cap room ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,he plays good defense against traditional post up big men but the rockets do not really have any anderson is going to keep torching him and he does not have the athleticism to keep up with capela ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,he by far our biggest free agency signing us signing a big free agent was unusual anyway ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,dedmon never played that many minutes either i bet it just that that they cannot sustain that level of play for the typical 30 minutes a game other centers play ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i hope that lma never guards anderson again in this series he getting torched by him ,64,nba
Thehelloman0,we just have to remember the 2012 or 2016 thunder series we won two in a row in 2012 and then lost 4 in a row 2016 we blew the thunder out the first game then lost the series obviously we do not have the amazing second option those teams had but we can bounce back ,4,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,what pissed me off the most was one play when anderson was at the 3 point line and he did not even bother to get up in his face just let him take a wide open 3 the guy is playing like he does not give a single fuck ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,that series was super boring insane amount of foul shots from both teams,2,nba
Thehelloman0,1 is a terrible reason if we need to tell on bertans and dedmon as core players there no way we will be contenders,1,nba
Thehelloman0,spurs had more wins though,25,nba
Thehelloman0,literally did not do a single thing well if he keeps playing like this we will get swept,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that does not explain anderson going 3 24 or whatever from 3,9,nba
Thehelloman0,he had a decent amount of good looks just passed them up,2,nba
Thehelloman0,that was hilarious it was obvious he did not even touch the ball ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,what is wrong with lma he has zero confidence,2,nba
Thehelloman0,his offense has been bad this season honestly his defense is great on traditional bigs but him having to guard ryan anderson is very bad he still a good pf just not a legit second option on a contender ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi is playing 1v5,47,nba
Thehelloman0,he passing up good shots playing bad defense when switched on the defender,2,nba
Thehelloman0,it would take the biggest comeback in playoff history to win this the games over,3,nba
Thehelloman0,fuck off,0,nba
Thehelloman0,our team falls apart without kawhi without fail,1,nba
Thehelloman0,bad pass followed by dumb foul come on guys,1,nba
Thehelloman0,were not the rockets shooting pretty bad last series why do not they keep doing that would be greatly appreciated,2,nba
Thehelloman0,wtf lebron,6,nba
Thehelloman0,raps are purposely fouling when thompson or kevin get in good position which has happened more than a few times,1,nba
Thehelloman0,chuck is right the raptors are playing like they think they cannot beat the cavs ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,that part of why i never wanted to pitch i always played catcher or outfield ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,wtf channing frye just completely manhandled joseph,3,nba
Thehelloman0,cojo,1,nba
Thehelloman0,take it back or 1v1 me in edge,1,runescape
Thehelloman0,yeah every now and then there great content suggested but there a lot of crappy suggestions,2,runescape
Thehelloman0,not really,11,runescape
Thehelloman0,yup i was talking with someone who said it only takes 40 50 days of game time to max and that if you are not maxed you are a low level player just a week ago obviously maxing is far easier now but 50 days of game time is still a huge amount of time ,0,runescape
Thehelloman0,yeah all the guy did put up the most points in a quarter in the finals ever on a hobbled ankle ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah duncan was still great in 2013 and 2014 but having two finals runs when you are 36 and 37 is not good in stats like this ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,agreed kawhi should be able to keep up a similar ppg number and his efficiency will still be great i just do not want people to say he played poorly if he gets his points on 60 ts or something ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i wonder how much money he makes they probably gave him a massive signing bonus too ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not see what that has to do with how he playing defense right now i agree though he could be a starter on every team except the warriors probably ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,roadside assistance usually costs like 10 a year or so so it does not really matter much either way,1,personalfinance
Thehelloman0,yeah and he was on the court and played the entire season less than two months after the incident ,10,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think he should have gotten banned but he would come into threads barely related to the nuggets and post a bunch of stuff about jokic people would talk about kat and he would just bring up jokic out of the blue he was very annoying ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,we have to keep in mind he was being guarded by a rookie or a 40 year old vince carter a lot of the time his efficiency will drop a lot ,1,nba
Thehelloman0, along with stellar defense why do people think wiggins is a good defender he bad at defense ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,basically every thread he would come in and only talk about jokic it was pretty annoying ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol i remember more than a few people saying that they would not get rid of draymond green for lebron how stupid can you be ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i love sean he a homer but his voice is great for commentating i think ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,what sucks is he started off the game great just stunk it up in the second half ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,draymond is far far better at offense though and he is not a stat hound like rodman was ever since he almost lost them that game going for the triple double ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,derozan played well against the cavs last year and got it together after his abomination of a game where he did not make a field goal this year,2,nba
Thehelloman0,injuries,1,nba
Thehelloman0,blake is more important since the clippers are a less deep team than the jazz,2,nba
Thehelloman0,randolph always played awesome in the first half but seemed gassed in the second half he still a great player just cannot sustain a high level of play very long ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,hayward and gobert are the only guys better than aldridge in my opinion,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i mean maybe they have a better supporting cast but we have kawhi,1,nba
Thehelloman0,warriors shoot the fifth most 3s a game 4 more than the league average,1,nba
Thehelloman0,sorry wiz fans it sounds like a sacrifice is required for the greater good of the nba,2,nba
Thehelloman0,did not think quin snyder would resort to r nba advice ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not know why people say klay cannot create for himself he did it just last year in the playoffs when curry was out,2,nba
Thehelloman0,not gonna complain kawhi does not complain when the refs call him because he knows he travels the way the game is officiated you really should travel like this because most of the time it is not called though ,2,nba
Thehelloman0, pushing under the basket for boards unless you are rudy gobert in a game 7 lol,67,nba
Thehelloman0,i mean kawhi definitely drives and purposely creates contact on the defender at least once a game and he gets a call where most of the time it would be a no call,3,nba
Thehelloman0, speaking of which he influenced more mainstream artists than any other music artist i can think of lil wayne is more influential in terms of rapping for sure i think,1,nba
Thehelloman0,kobe as wayne is perfect loved by the masses universally regarded as one of the best and hated on for no reason by a lot of people,3,nba
Thehelloman0,we started double teaming gasol and randolph and they are good passers out of the post that why they kept getting good 3 point looks guarantee we do not do that against the rockets ,1,nba
Thehelloman0, jj reddick assuming he stays is an elite role player i do not think that true at this point he completely disappeared in the playoffs except in game 5,-1,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah and while cp3 is a great defender he also fouls all the time i have no idea how he was not getting called on some of the defense he was playing yesterday it funny from a guy that complains all the time ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,that really not true people thought steph could easily be a multi time all star if he did not keep getting injured they just did not think he would be an mvp level player still very impressive development by their team ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think people realize how good they are lillard and mccollum both played amazing in game one and the blazers still lost handily this is a team that at all times can have an mvp level player and an all star on the court and have them not be tired ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,looks like ridley lol,2,nba
Thehelloman0,this is definitely true kd is just an instant mismatch for anyone and i bet he will do amazing against the jazz ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah that definitely should not have been a continuation,2,nba
Thehelloman0,yes and it was pretty obvious if you look at it again,0,nba
Thehelloman0,he was holding dj the entire time up until the ball came off the rim,1,nba
Thehelloman0,withey holding jordan there was pretty blatant,0,nba
Thehelloman0,i mean curry is pretty amazing and a two time mvp,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i definitely noticed one shot he made was off an obvious travel idk why him doing it is so much more obvious than everyone else that does it though,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol what a crappy shot,8,nba
Thehelloman0,first points the celtics got was one of those bs 3 point fouls he gets calls for less contact than other players and he ended the game drawing that bs loose ball foul,-2,nba
Thehelloman0,cp3 playing amazing as usual,10,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah i would love him on the spurs he a great backup,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol championship experience why is hubie doing this ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,lol gobert complaining about an obvious call,2,nba
Thehelloman0,wtf hayward has to take that,1,nba
Thehelloman0,celtics deserved to win but thomas is just as frustrating to watch as harden he is one of the biggest floppers in the league ,-8,nba
Thehelloman0,isaiah thomas flopping color me shocked,8,nba
Thehelloman0,no team in the nba hits 50 of their three pointers lol,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol crowder just grabbed walls arm there,0,nba
Thehelloman0,they call jump ball way too fast in the nba,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i mean that not much of an exaggeration,2,nba
Thehelloman0,not really gortat has been way better,1,nba
Thehelloman0,idk what the commentators were talking about bradley clearly got all ball first,3,nba
Thehelloman0,wow that screen gortat set was ridiculously illegal,12,nba
Thehelloman0,wow ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,wow that bullshit,6,nba
Thehelloman0,celtics had literally no rebounds for a long time,1,nba
Thehelloman0,idk why a two time mvp gets so disrespected on this sub,8,nba
Thehelloman0,he just averaged 30 ppg on insane efficiency and had been hitting clutch shots all season,2,nba
Thehelloman0,boston fans are assholes honestly so many of them shat all over the nets all season ,-1,nba
Thehelloman0,whiteside embiid drummond dwight so not much honestly lucky that most of the good big men in the league are in the west ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,you are really missing out i would say it on the same level as shows like the wire and the sopranos one of my roommates would not watch it for the same reasons but started getting into it after i started watching it again and now it one of his favorite shows ,2,television
Thehelloman0,i do not blame him i mean they are disrespecting one of the 30 guys that has his job there probably a lot of comraderie in head coaching positions ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,the first season is definitely the worst but it still good it a slow moving show that focused on the characters not the plot so it takes a while to get into it ,2,television
Thehelloman0,how was the shot clock operator supposed to do that when he could not see the rim ,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,mad men was amazing the whole way through ,11,television
Thehelloman0,he visiting sf but will fly to san antonio as well obviously,1,nba
Thehelloman0,dude the shot clock was reset the buzzer just went off patty shot it like an entire second after the buzzer went off he knew what he was doing also the reason it was not reset correctly was because pop walked in front of the guy in charge of the shot clock ,1,NBASpurs
Thehelloman0,the statlines and narrative was good but the actual games were really boring so many stoppages it was ridiculous the rockets attempted 168 free throws the spurs attempted 149 free throws in one more game another comparison the bulls have attempted 102 and celtics 90 in the same amount of games i am not looking forward to the rockets series the games will go extremely late most likely ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,wow that awful kind of reminds me of when i was in an embedded design class microcontroller programming basically and i realized that the final presentation of our final project was only about 20 of our grade so i did well on all the planning stages but when it came time to actually put everything together i completely half assed it i made this crappy little car that used potentiometers to control it turning left or right and a button for forward and back the thing started falling apart when i showed it to the teacher and i was the only person in the class he did not say good job to it was embarrassing but i still got a good grade in the class at least ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i thought the rockets thunder series was pretty boring ,1,nba

Thehelloman0,i mean he was held scoreless in game 3 with no assists in 18 minutes and barely managed to average 10 ppg in the regular season ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah but if the wizard hits a barrage then he can switch to ags and take the ranger out,3,todayilearned
Thehelloman0,there been so many commercials for it featuring nas during nba game commercials,1,todayilearned
Thehelloman0,when i did it you usually did two games in the same day also on saturdays you could umpire 3 or 4 games if they needed you he has a pretty bad pay rate honestly i think when i quit they paid 35 a game and they usually take 1 5 2 hours ,2,personalfinance
Thehelloman0,if you are spending this much money you should definitely get 16 gb of ram also 1200 is definitely not midrange you could get a pc that will max out games at 4k for that much with all the stuff you already have you probably only need to spend 700 or so to max out games at 1080p i would get an rx 480 8 gb or similar card if i were you this https www reddit com r buildapc comments 683o8g first build complete ryzen 1600 rx 580 and over guys build would be a good reference oh i see you want to stream well that build probably would not be the best but i would seek advice from r buildapc,4,personalfinance

Thehelloman0,you can put 18k in a 401k a year do you makes 36k a year and live paycheck to paycheck ,2,AdviceAnimals
Thehelloman0,exactly he was joking just like everyone else,3,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi is also a much better shooter than westbrook,5,nba
Thehelloman0,more than a few times this series he gotten double teamed and puts in a crazy shot he also will grab rebounds with two of our guys around him too idk how he does it at his age ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,i am surprised it not really brought up how quick conley is he blowing by green whenever he wants and green is not super quick but he a very good defender ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,lol why are you the only one who got downvoted ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i mean i could be a lot further along but i spent most of my time bossing with friends and was pretty unlucky with drops so i never had that much cash i am pretty sure i had something like 16 million range experience back in 2011 and i never trained it other than when i went to sara or arma once i got 99 i also never wanted or tried to max because i do not like so many skills like farming agility runecrafting etc ,1,runescape

Thehelloman0,a month of playtime is a lot of time even if it took you 15 days to get there that still 360 hours also you obviously know exactly what to do a new person to the game would probably be less efficient just because the game is new to them even though that account was an iron man ,1,runescape

Thehelloman0,kawhi played 44 minutes and was 18 the spurs are trash without him this season has been such a carry job by him,47,nba
Thehelloman0,and we fucking lost the spurs second best option on offense sucks compared to every other contender,14,nba
Thehelloman0,this team is being carried so hard by kawhi it ridiculous ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,fuck anyone who said the grizzlies would be an easy series,1,nba
Thehelloman0,was not goaltending should have been a no call on that gasol play probably,1,nba
Thehelloman0,took 3 steps getting to the rim,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i am wearing my tony parker shirt tonight should i not wash it the rest of these playoffs ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,god kawhi needs a better second option on offense we never get anything out of double teams on him ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,lol what bs terrible call,8,nba
Thehelloman0,i definitely think george is better than giannis had nothing to do with today have though ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,getting rid of teague is looking like it was an okay decision right now,3,nba
Thehelloman0,hey there lots of great restaurants to get fat at in san antonio,21,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think they would beat the warriors,11,nba
Thehelloman0,someone who could get him lots of open looks from 3 and help him when he gets double teamed i think an elite guard like chris paul or steph curry would be best ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,giannis had been getting fouled all game without getting calls,0,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah he getting hosed this game ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,that last possession was very clearly not a travel ,0,nba
Thehelloman0,lmao landry why has nobody told marv he has to retire ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,derozan is playing pretty great idk what the rest of his team is doing,3,nba
Thehelloman0,why the fuck did lowry not take that ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,2015 first round between clippers and spurs was an amazing series too,3,nba
Thehelloman0,man this series being so close without gobert really makes me think the jazz deserve to win,1,nba
Thehelloman0,so what harden does it more than any other player ginobili mills and even kawhi have done it too but nobody comes close to doing it as often as harden ,10,nba
Thehelloman0,harden does something extremely similar to kd rip through to get all those foul calls that will probably be made a non shooting foul in the next few years harden obviously exaggerates a lot more and tries to draw more fouls on 3 point shots than anyone else in the league he shot more 3 point foul shots this season than any team in the league ,10,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi playing awesome as well but his 16 point game last night is a pretty big knock imo pg has to do everything for his team and that he gotten close to beating cleveland twice is impressive i mean there no way the pacers should have lost last night they had so many good looks in the fourth quarter that everyone not named paul george was missing ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,yeah idk what op is talking about,29,nba
Thehelloman0,i disagree they probably get a little worse in the regular season but in terms of playoffs pg13 has generally outplayed kawhi,5,nba
Thehelloman0,i think paul george should be second or third,2,nba
Thehelloman0,he hit some shots when the rockets really needed them too,6,nba
Thehelloman0,nash also lost his second best player that season and put up better numbers than last year stoudemire was a complete stud and he still managed to take his team to the third best record in the west without him ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,nobody else in the league even comes close to harden in trying to draw fouls at the 3 point line ,14,nba
Thehelloman0,he kept getting wide open shots in the fourth quarter and he missed all of them he definitely could have sealed the game ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,i am not all that sure how they figure out the odds but i think the people making bets are a huge reason for the odds so the public can influence them a lot ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,i dunno demar was pretty good against cleveland last year he not always trash in the playoffs ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,how many times down the stretch did lebron stand by the 3 point line have the rest of the cavs sit on the perimeter and drive to the rim ,2,nba
Thehelloman0,i think kyle anderson can still be a boris diaw type player he played pretty well last night if he keeps working on his 3 point shot he will be a solid bench player ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,i only watched the first half then went to bed why did kawhi only get 2 points in the second half he was playing great in the first half also people complaining about the foul disparity between these teams are kind of silly spurs foul the least in the league and the grizzlies commit the most fouls hell half the time on defense the grizzlies commit a foul ,-2,nba
Thehelloman0,in your arena i think that how all fans should be complain about every call that goes against your team even if it obvious,3,nba
Thehelloman0,grizzlies foul on like every play,1,nba
Thehelloman0,fuck outta here,2,nba
Thehelloman0,so many good looks for pacers and only pg13 can hit anything,2,nba
Thehelloman0,the pacers defense is awful,1,nba
Thehelloman0,was he important to the team yeah is the 20 minutes per game you get from him vs pachulia a huge difference maker i do not think so ,4,nba
Thehelloman0, at the start of the season we do not even know if the new players are better or not the consensus is we have shit bench back then anyone who said that was stupid igoudala and livingston alone made your bench better than more than a few teams zaza and west were decent pickups too your bench got downgraded but it went from top 2 bench in the league to like top 5 10 at the beginning of the season they definitely started playing together once they got used to the system similarly to the spurs though ,3,nba
Thehelloman0,he was like your fifth or sixth best player he only played about 20 mpg ,5,nba
Thehelloman0,i disagree they lost minor role players harrison barnes and then picked up only slightly worse role players zaza not bad west is pretty good too harrison barnes missing is the only real hole igoudala and livingston were their biggest role players along with bogut mcgee is an improvement over ezeli too ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,this team without durant is similar to the team that went to back to back finals it should not be surprising that they are still dominating ,9,nba
Thehelloman0,if you think most engineers love their jobs you are definitely wrong,5,personalfinance
Thehelloman0,it took me 3 months after graduation to find a job and i interviewed in person at like 10 15 companies during that time i did five internships while in school at a good company too i only graduated with a 2 8 gpa though ,2,personalfinance
Thehelloman0,i thought the action sequence at the end of episode one of legion looked pretty bad great show though ,1,television
Thehelloman0,i go to texas to visit family a lot and the mexican food in cincinnati is more expensive and much worse,1,cincinnati
Thehelloman0,i agree the thunder supporting cast is worse but they are not that much worse in my mind ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,not even close to the same amount of games oladipo missed 15 and kanter missed 10 middleton missed 53 and parker missed 32 i do not think brogdon is better than adams or oladipo he good for a rookie but he only averaged 10 ppg and 26 mpg ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,lol how is giannis team significantly better you know that between parker and middleton they missed over 80 games right ,4,nba
Thehelloman0,i do not think that true jabari missed 32 games and middleton missed 53 compare that to the thunder with oladipo missing the most games of any important player on the thunder and he missed only 15 a rookie is one of their most important players and their big change this year was adding tony freaking snell and dellevadova greg monroe apparently done better this season but he still not an amazing asset ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,tell me how was that move harden did any different than a kd rip through ,6,nba
Thehelloman0,man i hate it when people act like if you do not like craft beer you are young or stupid i have had lots of different types of beer and did not like almost all of them ,1,news
Thehelloman0,that was a foul but good god the league needs to make it illegal like the rip through,2,nba
Thehelloman0,is not that basically what it is the spurs are doing exactly what you described in the first round they delay some games because of scheduling not rest ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,kawhi got a few bs fouls but almost every call he got was legit he played 40 minutes last game and drove a lot so that the biggest reason for the big differential ,1,nba
Thehelloman0,2004 lose to shaq kobe lakers in second round 2006 lose to mavs in second round 2008 lose to lakers in wcf 2009 lose to mavs in first round spurs higher seed 2010 swept by suns in second round 2011 lost to grizzlies in first round 2012 lost to thunder in wcf there a few choke jobs in there but expecting 6 7 championships in that short of a time is crazy literally one team in the modern era has won that many championships in that short a time and that michael jordan bulls a team so stacked that when he retired they made it to the second round and took ewing knicks to 7 games ,2,nba
