randoh12,telling someone that everything that comes out of a toaster oven is unhealthy is stupid think about it if a college student single user married homeowner that has a broken oven etc does not have an oven and only has a toaster oven they can prepare healthy dishes like roasted vegetables pasta dishes toasted breads etc that they can not prepare in an oven that they do not have so no just stop and stop the reports we see that you would rather argue than read and understand the rule of this sub please try and understand the basis or intent of the rules ,2,EatCheapAndHealthy

randoh12, formatted for easier viewing good lawdy 1 kg potato 300g flour 1 egg nutmeg salt here s how you make it 1 for this you want big russet potatoes we used 40 count bakers the potatoes need to be cooked bake em dry don t boil em water fail 2 poke em with a fork slick em up with some vegetable oil throw some salt on them this probably doesn t matter much i just do it out of habit and am trying to write out my process as accurately as possible 3 then stick them in the oven at 400 depending on your potatoes size they ll be cooked somewhere around an hour don t rush this part err on the side of overcooking them break one in half to make sure they re all the way done 4 let them cool at room temp don t put them in the fridge if they get cold they won t mix with the flour as well and you will fail the only way i have sped this part up this is the point in the process that you will want badly to speed up is to break your hot potatoes open spread their steaming carcasses on a sheet pan and fan them like a sushi chef or just use a fan the moving air cools them down much quicker they can be a little warm just not hot they are the right temp when you can comfortably squeeze not just hold them in your hand handwashing before this step helps too 5 now squeeze the potato meat out of its skin into a mixing bowl set on your digi scale remember to hit the tare button before doing this and have it set on g weigh out 1 k and squeeze that through your ricer into another bowl 6 weigh out the 300g flour i use ap bread flour will probably work fine cake flour will probably not bleached or unbleached doesn t matter same with organic or not whatever white people don t use whole wheat flour or any other whole grain flour i don t care if it s healthier 7 try your best to partially incorporate the flour evenly into the potato mix while you re adding it this will later allow you to mix up the dough for the reasons you need to developing some gluten strength so your dumpling will eat smoothly by letting the remaining water in the potato interact with the flour and then stop 8 you fail if you don t do this by having to overmix everything just to get your ingredients evenly dispersed i shake it over the top a little bit at a time and punch it in using my fingers sprinkle over it a big pinch of salt kosher or larger grained sea salt the kind of salt pinch that uses three fingers with none of them touching each other 9 grate to of a nutmeg nugget evenly over all this maybe 1 teaspoon if you re using ground 10 crack the egg in there and beat it up a little with a fork or a chopstick wash your hands also wash and dry your countertop 11 you can throw everything in a kitchenaid now if you want and go on low speed for 30 seconds or so with the dough hook i usually do but find i always end up kneading it by hand to get the texture right you probably should too 12 this is the part that most recipes i ve read don t clarify very well they say not to overmix because it ll leave you dense and gummy but they don t mention the part where if you don t mix it enough the shit ll fall apart when its cooking and eat like shitty dismal fail potatoes pull the dough out and knead it one time on your counter does it develop little natural cleavage lines like really young cheese that breaks apart along the curds knead it up a bit until it doesn t break apart and has a little bounce to it maybe 10ish strokes 13 the surface of the dough shouldn t be sticky if it is sprinkle a little flour over it a tablespoonish at a time and knead it in gently until its not note if you just did this step you probably fucked up somewhere just a little bit most likely it won t matter that much and you re so close to the end that you might as well finish it out do cook and try some of the finished product though before humiliating yourself in front of others roll that puppy up into a big uniform dough log on your countertop 14 line sheet pans or cookie sheets with parchment paper cut a one inch slice of the dough laterally down the length of the log with a big chef s knife lay that slice down flat and cut an inch thick log off of it you should have a long rectangle of dough about an inch thick 15 throw down a light dusting of bench flour where you re gonna roll cut your dough loggy in half and roll one piece of it gently into a little tube about half an inch thick cut that crosswise with a bench scraper or knife every half inch or so try to make them uniform so they cook in the same amount of time if you want to roll each one over the tines of a fork or a gnocchi roller you can i usually do not 16 use the side of the bench scraper or knife to gently transfer them to the paper lined sheets make it rain flour on them while shaking the pan around so they don t stick together 17 you have gnocchi now you can either cook and eat them right away or freeze them these are your only choices there is never a reason to put them in the fridge if you freeze them do it on the sheet trays and then portion them off into baggies once they re frozen don t bag them first how to prepare 1 now boil up a bunch of water with a little salt 1gal 1t use lots of water it s like blanching green vegetables if you lose the boil when you add the product you fail 2 drop the gnocchi in they ll sink after a little bit they ll start popping up to the surface don t pull them out yet they ll be undercooked when most of them are bobbing on the surface start counting really slowly up to thirty now they re done 3 pull em out of the water using a spider or tea strainer and drop em directly into whatever sauce you have simmering in the pan next to them cook it all together for a minute and serve you win edit this is just a recipe for gnocchi the sauce and other stuff is separate ,39,food
