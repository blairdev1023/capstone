Memitim,good answers in here to be more specific the ship has ballast tanks that are used to control the depth of the ship when you want to drop it you just flood the tanks until it drops down as far as you need it to be once done the water is pushed out with low pressure high volume compressed air there is a stern gate that is raised and lowered by hydraulic pumps to open the back of the ship open to full in this photo source the anchorage is a mini version of the ship that i was on uss tarawa our division a gang took care of the ballast compressors and hydraulic lift system for the stern gate that closes over that gaping hole in the back under normal operations so i spent a lot of time playing with those systems there are even hand pumps to actuate the gate in the event of power loss which is pretty amazing since the stern gate on the tarawa was around 95 tons ,10,MilitaryPorn

Memitim,if i understand what you are asking correctly that wo not do anything useful it sounds like you want to manually specify the number of weeks so here some context the variable thefirstdate is a datetime value whereas diffinweeks is an integer that is getting added to 1 to get the row number it could be inlined it by worksheets sheet2 cells 1 datediff ww thefirstdate date 1 paste so if you prefer to manually enter the number of weeks just set that number in the same place that the date difference would otherwise go worksheets sheet2 cells 1 numberofweeks 1 paste because 1 numberofweeks is just the row number for the cell that you are pasting to so change the 1 as needed to match the row just above the first weekly row or set it to 0 if you want the first weekly row to be 1 of course you do not have to set that value in vba since you can read from a cell numberofweeks worksheets sheet1 cells 1 1 value did that get in the ballpark of what you were looking for ,1,excel
Memitim,the text formula seems like it should be perfect for this but does not support adding leading zeroes without ditching the decimal hoping someone proves me wrong so let go that level of stupid that is truly only achievable with microsoft excel d substitute a1 mid a1 find char 1 substitute a1 char 1 2 1 find char 1 substitute a1 char 1 3 find char 1 substitute a1 char 1 2 1 if left right mid a1 find a1 find a1 1 1 find char 1 substitute a1 char 1 3 find a1 find a1 1 1 2 1 text mid a1 find a1 find a1 1 1 find char 1 substitute a1 char 1 3 find a1 find a1 1 1 0000 right mid a1 find a1 find a1 1 1 find char 1 substitute a1 char 1 3 find a1 find a1 1 1 2 text mid a1 find a1 find a1 1 1 find char 1 substitute a1 char 1 3 find a1 find a1 1 1 0000 0 i feel like i am working with perl again what this does is grabs that heirarchy id from cell a1 subs in a character that will likely never be in your string char 1 in place of the flanking slashes so that we have a unique character in the string to find in the nested finds and looks for that to get the first and last characters of that special little section it then checks for a decimal point in said section if no decimal the text formula is the easy way to add the leading zero and then a 0 gets slapped on the end for consistency but if there is a decimal point the front chunk gets the leading zero appended before being reunited with the original fraction side whatever results then gets subbed in for whatever was in the slot between the second and third slashes one thing to note is that it only looks for a single digit after the decimal point if there is more than one digit it will treat it like a whole number this can probably be simplified and likely be a lot easier with vba with power query it should be possible as well but that code would be unpleasant let this be a lesson to never drink and excel ,2,excel
Memitim,yep just have vba get the difference in weeks between your target date and the current day like worksheets sheet1 range thestufftocopy copy sets thefirstdate to the date in cell in sheet1 a1 thefirstdate worksheets sheet1 cells 1 1 value gets the difference between the date in sheet1 a1 and the current date diffinweeks datediff ww thefirstdate date pastes whatever in the copy buffer to sheet2 with rows offset by number of weeks worksheets sheet2 cells 1 diffinweeks 1 paste or hard code the date to keep it out of the sheet or if you are partial to entering the number of weeks manually you can read it directly from the cell and then use that as your row increment i like to use a workbook open sub in thisworkbook to automatically create new stuff based upon time periods so that might work for what you are doing like this one that creates a new tab when i open the workbook for the first time in any given day private sub workbook open n date todaydate replace n todayexists false for each ws in worksheets if todaydate ws name then todayexists true end if next ws if todayexists false then set ws thisworkbook worksheets base day sheet ws copy after thisworkbook sheets sheets count activesheet name todaydate else thisworkbook worksheets todaydate activate end if end sub,1,excel

Memitim,i worked at an msp that pushed unitrends a bit over a year ago it alright particularly if you go with their all in one server as long as you overestimate the capacity we had one client that had one of their sites at around 85 of listed capacity on the local server and the bloody thing was constantly running out of space because the job to dump old backups would fail due to insufficient free space their support acknowledged how goofy the behavior was so maybe it has been improved since i had challenges updating a couple of servers because they had put x32 and x64 versions of the same dependencies in the os which caused the updater really just launching yum update to shit the bed i had to manually clean up the packages and install the expected versions to get the core unitrends apps to update they also had a weird incongruity between the hyper v virtual appliance centos 5 based and the vmware appliance centos 6 based i converted the vmware appliance to put in on a client hyper v server in order to install monitoring tools with dependencies unsupported in 5 none of these were that big of a deal to resolve but they did have me questioning how unitrends manages the software that they are putting out to their customers ,1,sysadmin

Memitim,are they referencing that based on a percentage basis running some quick estimates of cab and uber rides from o hare to union station it appears that cab rides are about twice the cost so the tax for cab rides would be half of what it is for uber rides without the additional surge tax being applied so the taxis would see an increase but this would be far more significant to other ride hire services even without the extra taxation speaking of another thing that i cannot find is whether these taxes would be applied to other limo services every article just refers to taxis uber and lyft if so how do they apply when a service is hired on a time basis rather than per a discrete point a to b trip ,2,news

Memitim,we had a client who required this setup but that was because they had a partner who worked in their suite who was actually in a different company since it was legal work he needed his voice data on a different pipe than everyone else the op is dealing with an internal app though so it sounds like the ceo just wants to cut off a likely attack vector to the critical business app the employees workstation network which makes a whole lot of sense although having employees administer it via the internet does not my guess is that they just need to firewall it off so that only critical ports are available to specific workstations perhaps even to a secured jump box that only gets used for administering the application but without knowing the actual requirements this is just a solution looking for a problem to solve ,2,sysadmin
Memitim,it would probably be easier to make the argument without the ceo understanding the osi model too much vlans operate at layer 2 and rely on the content of the packet while physical separation is at layer 1 and does not care what content is on a wire that is not connected technically vlans violate security principle 1 do not trust the client but that just between us chickens here in the coop realistically vlan separation should be sufficient so long as the administrators avoid trunks on incoming ports and disable intervlan routing high security separation really should use an actual firewall at minimum though ,3,sysadmin

Memitim,ah fair play i did not specify the official itil books so itil book could include anything that someone writes on a piece of paper and claims to be itil related since anybody can make claims about what itil says see original article of this thread for an example it would be likely that at least one book would claim that itil was designed to faciliate management of it by the ignorant or that it dictates that it work should be siloed regardless of the accuracy of either of those claims with that being said is the author of that book claiming that itil suggests that it work be divided up with separated resources as the article author claims that itil does in the quote that i included given the title it sounds like the author has taken it upon himself to provide some specific steps for regimenting it work while using itil practices perhaps by using that factory metaphor to explain his ideas i suppose that could be useful for shops that are incapable of coming up with their own methodologies although i cannot help but think that is how the bureaucratic clusterfucks came about that were referenced by the article and by other people in this thread ,2,sysadmin

Memitim,changes in context that provide for richer usage are typically a boon for language however literally is one of the few changes that i dislike since it is now indistinguishable from the hyperbole that it is intended to differentiate in the first place it is as though quotation marks are being used for a paraphrase there is now literally no way to differentiate hyperbole from fact when literally is used unless the reference that was made is physically impossible i love to play with words and abuse slang but language should still retain some useful meaning since it is first and foremost a means to deliver information now additional convolutions are required to clarify to a listener or reading that i intended exactly what i said since the most useful word for that purpose has lost its meaning ,1,writing

Memitim,the first time that i got raided there were a couple of foundations and a few walls left so i demolished what was left moved elsewhere and built a tiny base i tamed a low level dilo gave it a name had it follow me to my new base got it into the pen took care of it until it leveled and then stabbed it in the face with a pike until dead then i demolished the base dropped all of my gear on the ground and punched a trike until it killed me when i respawned i just started grinding out a stone pickaxe and found a new place to build a cabin that others would eventually raid you will get used to having to start from scratch because other people find their fun in destroying all of your stuff you can either get on a server with a powerful tribe and join them which will mean a nearly free ride or you can continually go it alone make multiple stashes and maybe come away from each raid with a little bit left over to help to alleviate the next grind perhaps you too will decide that destroying the dinos and structures of others is fun and get some raiding in of your own you might even find one of these mythical places where player versus player combat actually takes place i ran with the big tribe on a peaceful server for a while but that server had a lot of associated baggage that bored the hell out of me so i am back to wandering i will likely never again have the cool stuff that came with the big tribe life like high level dinos and advanced equipment but oh well that just how the game was designed i have not yet gotten the urge to wreck other peoples shit without provocation though and i have yet to encounter a raider that does not take care to hide their actions in anonymity and so have not found anyone that i feel like harassing welcome to ark ,2,playark

Memitim,i just quit an official server today that is exactly like that i actually like the peace and i was in a tribe full of great people but holy shit the endless crying that floods global when a base would get hit or a dino would get killed was absolutely ridiculous one tribe got raided a couple of days ago and the entire tribe quit except for one guy who started griefing people and going on long boring emo tirades in global i guess they have all gotten complacent and forgotten that every single object in the game is disposable i cannot entirely blame folks for getting bent when something like that does happen since taming and gathering for large projects on an official server requires giving up all available free time but they knew the score when they booted the bloody game up it sucks taking the loss but pitching a public bitch does nothing other than provide additional satisfaction to shitty people i finally had enough of the whining and the obscene tame times and the resource grinding and the lag oh sweet baby jesus the lag i am currently vetting unofficial servers for something a bit faster paced where folks simply settle up and or reinforce if some choad messes with their stuff rather than throwing childish hissy fits in global or tossing foundations every which way and especially where there is little to no fucking lag i really liked my tribe and getting along peacefully with most folks on the server but hated everything else ,1,playark

Memitim,true on foot in the situation op described bugs usually focus on the tamed dino i just either mount or whistle passive and run whenever i have dinos out when bugs strike since it so hard to avoid friendly fire except when it a ptera in which case i run around in circles trying to jump and mount while the dipshit flies all over the place ,2,playark

Memitim,it sucks given the massive time sink that goes into base building gotta let that feeling go or find an unofficial server that has a ruleset that you like do not be confused by the use of pvp in the server names this game is a griefer paradise and rarely has any real confrontation the vast majority of hits are either offline or with completely overwhelming force there is very little that you can do to prevent it if folks with established resources have it out for you offense gets offline persistence rendering order issues long range visibility of interior light sources game mechanics such as bird pickups and foundation blocking high powered dinos while controlled by a person anonymity for most attacks and flexibility in their approach defense gets walls nearly useless dinos when left to the ai easily seen traps and possibly auto turrets if they somehow last that long all of these are clearly defined in terms of their capabilities and are therefore readily countered if established tribes have any interest in mowing down new tribes they will easily find you and destroy everything the only things that you can count on keeping are your levels and your knowledge and the former only applies if you do not play hardcore the actual survival game otherwise just assume that when you log out that everything that you have built and every dino that you have tamed will be gone when you return and be pleasantly surprised when some of it remains on next join your best bet is to hook up with an existing tribe that already has significant capabilities because you cannot create secure locations out of the gate you can also find an official server undergoing a period of peace and try to build up before things come apart my suggestion if you do decide to tough it out on your existing server is to use multiple tiny bases that you expect to lose regularly just enough space for a bed mortar refinery smithy and box you can squeeze those into a 1x3x1 building which can be made in a line or in an l shape that will get metal tools decent weapons and all saddles super extra bonus if you find an abandoned base with these facilities most people do not bother to check bases that look visibly shelled out so they are great for hiding out except for being unable to build facilities in either case be very careful with refinery usage since that creates a beacon while running stick to heavy fog and midday and do not mine big rocks to completion since the boulder explosion screams hey somebody out in the open right now a long ways away you can try to hit back but the established tribes are likely recovering from your minor nuisance with full kibble tames and double layered metal while you are grabbing level 8 dilos and smacking river rocks for hours to make a couple of grenades but if you do succeed in pushing back and becoming a major power that would make for one hell of an experience ,2,playark
Memitim,the syngaming net 10xtam 5xres activeadmins description does not say anything about tougher wild dinos but i think that it is enabled on there single dilo kills were leaving me near dead i wandered too close to a 16 ape who two shot me to death then i got instakilled by a pair of raptors i managed to get in a single swing with my pike as i died i was only in full hide through most of those fights so maybe i underestimated i then tamed a raptor saddled it and went for a ride it damn near got killed by a pair of dilos one level 8 and the other 32 i ended up having to flee because the raptor was nearly dead while both dilos were alive despite being hit repeatedly force fed it a few stacks of meat and went back at them same result two flurries with a 113 raptor and both were alive while the raptor was beaten down both times i could be mistaken about the dino difficulty but i have played for a few hundred hours and have never seen wild dinos so rough fair warning just in case otherwise it was a very smooth running server albeit extremely quiet with few to no people on ,1,playarkservers

Memitim,yeah that why i love this game the devs just make a big sandbox and say here some building blocks go make your own fun ,2,playark
Memitim,i am not arguing as i get that how many servers are my point was simply that not everyone plays on pvp servers for the reason that you stated that we do on our server the tribes get along fine we have basic agreements to keep things amicable like no building in caves or on rarer mat spawns like metal we get together and raid when the occasional group of griefers try to set up shop and occasionally a couple of tribes will get into a pissing contest over an accidental dino kill or something and hit each other for a bit but there no general warfare i have no doubt that someone will come along and fuck it all up because that what people do but everybody is loaded up with turrets personal weapons and dinos so it wo not be one sided unless they bring esp and aimbots of course like i said before death is meaningless in this game anyway so whatever happens will happen i am not particular concerned about staying alive and if when everything goes to shit then either my tribe will attempt to rebuild or they will disband and i will be back to hiding in forests waiting to be bloodbagged like on my old servers in the meantime as long as people are not messing with me i am not going out of my way to undo the things that they spent many hours working on but i wish you the best of luck in accomplishing whatever it is that you are looking to get done on your server ,5,playark
Memitim, no you came to pvp because you want to raid people i agree that the bitching about griefers is pointless but i strongly disagree about this point i just play on pvp servers so that i have the option of using force when needed my physical life is also pvp enabled but i do not break into my neighbors house murder their pets and drag their sleeping bodies into their swimming pool just because it is possible i have no urge to rob other people of hours or days of effort without any provocation but i do reserve the option to use violence if threatened unfortunately the threat of violence means dick in this game since death is almost meaningless so it not really very useful but it still better than dealing with griefers on pve servers since there even less that you can do about them there ,7,playark

Memitim,i just enabled sm4 as part of trying to isolate any client side performance issues from server lag and noticed a significant improvement the server lag specific effects are still there but the overall engine performance is much better i read about issues that seemed to be specific to lighting but have not noted any differences from running vanilla so far it certainly seems worth trying to disable the switches to see if your crashes are reduced my client occasionally crashes right before loading into game probably 10 of the time but it did that prior to enabling shader model 4 unfortunately the only log for crashes appear to be minidumps in the ark shootergame saved logs directory i loaded mine into visual studio but they just show that a buffer overrun occurred seems like it happens when in game audio initializes but cannot say for certain it is rare enough that i have not bothered trying to mitigate it by changing the audio format as that would give me grief with other applications that i use if your crashes are the same then you may want to play with the audio format of your output device mine is set to 44100 hz but they may develop on systems set to 48000 hz if you are crashing to desktop while in game might be worth checking out the dbg files in case they give any useful info ,1,playark

Memitim,unofficial servers are already doing this using third party mods so the patch wo not actually change anything other than integrating the functionality into the game engine therefore if you are really curious as to how it has been working in practice you can look for one the servers that are doing it today and check it out ,1,playark
Memitim, i do not get it what does this mean to the lay person servers that implement this can be both pve and pvp based upon a predefined schedule such as pve during the night and pvp during the day how would this apply to pve players it would not the server would be both pve and pvp depending on the time either server or in game would they still get all their dino killed by griefers kiting level 100 alpha rexes to their base when they are offline yes that is completely unrelated to the server being either pvp or pve since it can happen on both ,4,playark
Memitim,outstanding some very cool features nice to finally see some kind of death penalty as it seems pretty silly in a survival game for death to be a viable tactic the refert will be cool for making green spaces in the base although folks still should not rely on it for cover maybe if the rendering engine is updated to show all objects at the same range and give foliage priority does the replacement check apply to any kind of replacement ie stone wall to metal wall or strictly for like to like awesome if the former there are a few places in the base that are getting fixed ,10,playark

Memitim,ichthy is not in the list understandable since it is not in the calculator i do not know the amount of kibble needed but i did a level 111 with less that 20 kibble and it took less than an hour it dodo kibble so just bring a stack of 50 and throw the leftovers in the fridge no narcotics needed of course as much as you might wish you could tranq the flighty bastards ,3,playark
Memitim,the difficultyoffset value is a float that is the value of the difficulty value multiplier converted to a 0 1 scale think of it like difficultyoffset 1 being equal to 100 of current max difficulty value which is 4 0 in the current build this wiki article http ark gamepedia com difficulty explains further and provides a table for getting the difficultyoffset value that matches your desired difficulty value ,1,playark
Memitim,the devs are targeting a specific gameplay style on the official servers that is slower and more deliberate than you prefer fortunately for you unofficial servers are numerous and have a multitude of different settings including modifications to taming times structure resistance and harvest amount you can very easily find one that addresses all of the criticisms that you listed and probably most that you did not tl dr if your question begins with am i the only one who the answer is always no ,2,playark
Memitim,they do not need to wipe just set a decay on items based upon neglect a player logs in builds stuff and then logs out after a week of no activity decay kicks in have everything owned by that player or tribe start taking damage over time until the player or a tribe member logs in or it is destroyed in another week items not on foundations like campfires could decay faster should be fairly light on the server just a check every few hours of if owner last login is greater than seven days inflict x amount of damage ,1,playark

Memitim,i tested item transfer a couple of days ago after seeing threads like this and confirmed that it works fine on official pvp servers it looks odd in the steam inventory because all stacks are broken out into individual items so a full stack of fiber shows up as 200 individual fiber icons but in the transfer interface in game it shows as a single stack i have not tested character transfer so cannot speak to that ,1,playark

Memitim, actions have nothing to do with where you were born guess i must be crazy ,2,playark
Memitim,yeah i cannot fault anyone for playing the game according to the mechanisms provided just seems like some cultures foster different tendencies toward certain play styles for that i think that it would be a good idea to provide regional servers so that like players can be matched up but i do not see that as a panacea better that alternative rulesets be implemented that support different preferences fortunately private server settings allow for things like stronger structures and disabling item transfers albeit at a rather severe cost of being subject to any manner of abuse by administrators i am hoping that the devs create more game modes that will be implemented on official servers like they are doing with survival of the fittest although i suspect that many here would be disappointed in any other modes that they come up with since this dev team seems very much in favor of promoting a cutthroat game of total conquest ,1,playark

Memitim,i am not sure how you could believe that i feel that all soldiers were bloodthirsty killers given that i specifically spoke about soldiers selectively choosing when or when not to kill other people all in reference to an article that clearly shows a case where one warrior chose not to kill another while i have no particular knowledge of military training by either the us or germany in the wartime 1940s i can say from my own experience that bloodthirst is not a trait trained for in the modern us military nor do i understand your reference to the perception of evil since i made no mention of the morality of these actions although the overall theme of my post was about the application of selective morality in individual decisions so that may have led to the interpretation perhaps i was too wordy in my previous post as i am prone to be i apologize if that was the case allow me to summarize in one paragraph brown bomber group dropped many bombs not only on bremen during the attack referenced in the op article but for many attacks over the course of two years and that was when they were not conferring the intelligence they gathered to their command or passing on the lessons of their experience to other aircrews stigler action at a bare minimum permitted the crew of the ye olde pub to debrief with their command and for brown to complete a combat tour that consisted of 29 total combat missions of which this mission was his second i cannot find the details of further activities of the ye olde pub itself or its crew with a cursory search outside of the notes regarding brown combat tour and so cannot assume any further actions on their part therefore i cannot speak to any other specific ramifications of stigler action but that was never my intent rather i was pointing out that these actions do not occur in a vacuum because the threat that an enemy soldier presents is not determined by any individual action but by their contribution to the entire war effort which typically becomes more significant with experience stigler spared brown and brown went on to fly 27 more missions all that said you actually seem more concerned with my moral opinions rather than my observations on wisdom in war so i will share them i am glad that the situation occurred as it did aside from the feel good story that we all get to enjoy brown went on to live a good life and contribute to his fellow human beings i also think that stigler was an idiot who likely condemned some of his fellow germans to fiery deaths and did no favors to germany overall war effort i think that the notion of stigler action being chivalrous is bullshit since again that bomber crew was certainly still a serious threat for several reasons just not to stigler himself at that particular moment i think that war is a horrible nasty vile fucking business and the longer that it gets drawn out by asinine displays of mercy which i am sure that the people being repeatedly bombed would have appreciated oh so much the worse it is for everyone who did not give a damn about these nationalistic power grabs in the first place i am also fairly certain that soldiers will continue to do this sort of thing in all of the wars to come just as they have since human beings evolved enough to begin organizing their carnage i hope that both clarifies my previous posts and helps you to rest a little easier regarding the threat of a scourge of people like me in the upcoming war that you referenced ,1,todayilearned
Memitim,i have read catch 22 and i second your recommendation to any who have not excellent book it changes nothing about the fact that the bomber crews were not just a threat due to the payload that they may or may not have on hand on that particular day but because of all of the bombs that they would be dropping on people for days weeks or even months to come even more so after each mission that they survived since each run made them that much more skilled in the art of destruction which they continued to either practice or pass on to others to quote from the op link lt brown went on to complete a combat tour which is a very short and polite way of saying lt brown returned to help drop even more ordinance on the countrymen of the kindly pilot who spared his life in fact the 379th bomber group http en wikipedia org wiki 379th expeditionary operations group that lt brown was flying with is recognized as the most successful of all the eighth air force heavy bomber groups it held records as far as bomb tonnage dropped 26 459 tons more than any other unit including those operational before the 379th arrived in the uk it also exceeded all other uk bomb groups in the total number of missions flown carrying out 330 between may 1943 and 15 may 1945 note that the majority of that time occurred after 20 december 1943 when this little display of chivalry took place people romanticize the mano a mano confrontations of war but war is not a sport it is an ongoing slaughter that continues to destroy the lives of both participants and bystanders until one side no longer has the logistics or the will to fight and the other side decides to relent stigler mercy in the sky very likely resulted in the deaths of many other germans who not so sportingly caught highly explosive ordinance as it rained down from the skies above over the following months i would be curious what they would have thought of that honor ,2,todayilearned

Memitim,by attacking a change in something that a great many people are personally familiar with support from conservatives is reinforced they are not trying to be factually correct or make a reasonable point they are taking an opportunity to generate outrage among their target audience which is made up of people who proclaim a dislike of change as the central tenant of their political philosophy i cannot say that i blame them as it certainly seems to be much easier than developing a rational argument and still proves to be just as effective if not more so when used with large populations ,6,facepalm

Memitim,so much agreement the other huge benefit is not having so many actions stacked on the same buttons which can be extremely detrimental in a hurried fight just have to be careful about clicking ok in dialog boxes if you map the left mouse button to the h normal attack button since you will attack at the same time as clicking ok i have not inadvertently smacked an npc yet but i keep waiting to slip best to get used to hitting the enter key for those for npc menus such as from merchants it not an issue though ,1,DarkSouls2
Memitim,yeah much better than one although there were some pretty silly choices like heavy use of shift as a modifier key and double clicking for heavy attacks there are some folks who put together autohotkey scripts to create control schemas that make far more sense to actual keyboard mouse players you can find threads about them in the steam forum for dsii i have not tried them personally but they look pretty good i will probably try them out tomorrow since early adopters have been working out the kinks edit screw waiting decided to try it tonight using an autohotkey script to map the keyboard attack buttons to the mouse buttons massively improves attacking no more input delay while the game waits to see if you intend a single or double click reddit thread with an autohotkey script is here http www reddit com r darksouls2 comments 23zq0s mousekeyboard fix ,1,gaming

Memitim,it plays just fine with a keyboard and mouse hell of a lot better than the first port for sure but all of the control indicators in game are for an xbox 360 controller so if you are using kb m or another controller you will have to do some translating until you get used to the controls the manual has the mouse keyboard and xbox controller commands in the same section so i just left it up on my second screen while playing to compare as needed until i learned them ,1,darksouls
Memitim,some folks simply do not like playing with a controller i played dark souls on the 360 for dozens of hours before it came out on pc and immediately bought it on pc to play with keyboard mouse instead which admittedly turned out to be pointless until dsfix came along but at least it did have the option the only thing that surprises me about the decision regarding controls is how many people demand that other people play exactly the way that they prefer to play are these people paying a salary to others to play video games or something i have not gotten my check yet so they will have to make with the dough before i give a crap how they think i should be doing things if somebody wants to use a keyboard trackball xbox controller or nintendo power glove to play games then more power to them yet another great thing about pc gaming is having that choice as a bonus we apparently get to troll aspiring microsoft employees ,0,darksouls
Memitim,the pc manual only uses xbox controller conventions to explain how to perform different actions instead of including the keyboard and or mouse control or even just giving the general control description for example for item use choosing an item in your possession and pressing the a button on it will display the action menu at least the keyboard mouse control is a hell of a lot better even if some decisions are mind bendingly odd double click for heavy attacks so overall the ds2 port is still a major improvement over the ds1 port ,4,darksouls

Memitim,i am not the person that you responded to i just wanted to address your summation that religion and science both rely of leaps of faith but you support religion because the deity explanation has greater consistency the difference is that as a religious person you choose an answer before a question is ever asked the answer is god any other theory cannot be correct because that would mean that god cannot be the correct answer you can describe anything in the universe as it god there is literally no way to attribute any other explanation for anything in existence once god becomes possible because any alternative point can be successfully disputed by saying no it god to op point there can be no debate involving belief because the outcome of the debate has already been determined it is no surprise that you find a deity to be more a consistent explanation for any question that you may ever have metaphysical or otherwise the answer to the religious theory of everything is god and every other observation or discovery in the universe must fit within that framework as being a part of god theological writings that espouse doubt as a healthy attribute of religion still do so under the base assumption that god is the answer that faith from a scientific standpoint our knowledge of the universe is full of holes and constantly in flux even the idea of universe is ambiguous and subject to argument most scientists take what has been observed and measured and then try to determine what a piece would look like that fills the blanks all of the pieces have to make sense in the context of the body of knowledge that has been discovered thus far which itself is always subject to change as new discoveries are made a scientific explanation only attains a level of consistency when the ideas are tested over and over and over again and even then can never attain the level of big t truth because there is always the possibility of the discovery of a more accurate or precise explanation new theories are met with widespread skepticism and rigorously studied in an attempt to find the parts that do not work even theories that have been tested so thoroughly that they get titled as laws and accepted as facts by most laymen are regularly challenged with new ideas every claim must be proven and that proof is only as good as the latest data can support that is the complete opposite of faith tl dr in religion you start by knowing the answer to everything and determine how the parts fit within that answer in science you do not know the answer to anything but you have ideas about some things which are subject to change as new information is discovered ,2,AdviceAnimals

Memitim,any ambiguous sentence can be rewritten so why retain the potential for ambiguity by utilizing the same convention ie comma separated items with a coordinating conjunction for two different use cases simply choose one use case to apply the convention to and rewrite sentences that contain the other use case i offer two reasons for using commas for comma delineated lists and not for parenthetical elements containing compound subjects 1 parenthetical elements that contain compound subjects are only a fraction of the total usage of parenthetical elements most wo not cause ambiguity issues so feel free to continue comma use with those eg maggie my dog of seven years plays fetch 1 parenthetical elements can already be delineated with other punctuation such as dashes or parentheses so go with those for compound elements instead eg we invited the strippers stalin and jfk to dance their sexy dictator dance to do the same with item lists typically requires breaking paragraph structure altogether and going with separate bullet or numbered lists instead this way readers always have a consistent expectation if there are comma separated items with a coordinating conjunction it a list end of story i agree that the onus is on the writer but communication is a two sided transaction so certain assumptions are left to the sender as to what the receiver can interpret best to reduce the variables rather than relying on common sense or some such it like putting a road sign next to a sharp curve that reads do not go too fast around this curve rather than simply saying maximum speed 25 mph ,2,funny
Memitim,this is an excellent point if you must write to ap standards for work or school purposes it is important to note that the ap stylebook editors oppose the use of the oxford comma whenever possible for everyone else who is writing to be clearly understood just press the damned comma button ,3,funny
Memitim,but i would have to type one more whole character are you trying to bankrupt the publishing industry seriously if there are comma separated items at the end of a sentence that contain a coordinating conjunction it is almost always going to be a list if the sentence is written in that format and the comma separated items are not actually a list then rewrite relax wannabe steinbecks you were not destined to get that pulitzer through your brilliant use of commas to delineate a parenthetical element anyhow take a shot with clarity instead ,1,funny
Memitim,i hate these stupid hypothetical examples of possible exceptions that might justify not using the oxford comma if adding the oxford comma creates ambiguity then the sentence simply sucks altogether and needs to be rewritten ,35,funny

Memitim,agreed a good example of a similar situation done far better is in dark souls when crossing the bridge in undead burg for the first time and getting attacked by the hellkite dragon spoiler the player reaction is entirely reliant upon mechanics that have been available from the start of the game but the player is challenged to leverage those skills under heavy pressure in order to survive no flashing icons popups or other such nonsense required admittedly the game does do a lax job of introducing those skills to the player in the first place but that dark souls for you ,1,gaming

Memitim,the omission of the apostrophe from the possessive it could be due to the lack of apostrophe use for any possessive pronoun and or possibly to differentiate from the contraction it is in either case i do not understand why that convention would logically lead to the plural form of it suddenly inheriting an apostrophe it not like the apostrophe represents not possessive i am genuinely curious though as to why you think that as i may be missing something ,3,movies
