kyle1867,not to play devils advocate here but you cannot just state some one jim bob is likely a child molester just be cause you do not agree with their lifestyle i in no way believe either him or josh were in the right here it is horrible what josh did and it was not handled in a way that protected the victims but throwing out baseless accusations is just obsurd and devalues any rational point you were trying to drive home even yourself admit you have nothing to go on so why even say it ,2,news

kyle1867,i should have known better than to show any support for conservative ideals on this site i think at best they would get a minority government but the conservative and liberal parties would railroad them on every issue and nothing would change canada is not going to see a changing of the guard in the next election i guarantee it shit on me all you want every ndp voter knows its true i am saying this as someone who voted for them in the ontario premier race they wo not get in at the helm ,0,worldnews
kyle1867,i dont think the ndp are capable of running the country sadly they are untested on a large scale and have not done too well in the provinces where they are the government alberta will be there first big test to see if they are capable the conservative party was good too they are hands down the most capable harper is the reason everything is so bad in blue he off his rocker now people saying the green party should take over are total idiots and should have every opinion they give ignored ,-7,worldnews
kyle1867,if a report like this was passed off as a case in a court of law the judge would laugh in their face before throwing it in the trash but apparently heresay speculation and circumstantial evidence to the media heres looking at you espn is binding proof that we cheated i think the whole team needs to call individual press conferences and just silently flex in front of the mics until the press gets the idea this idea should also include robbie kraft and lord belichick ,6,Patriots
kyle1867,every point you just made is the same reason why i do not play warhammer 40k at my local game shop i mostly just collect them now to paint and look at because i cannot deal with 12 year old autists arguing rules with me i feel so out of touch with the people there even just buying paints and models ,1,pics
