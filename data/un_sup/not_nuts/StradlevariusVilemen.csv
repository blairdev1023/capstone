StradlevariusVilemen,i am not a urm but not one single person in my family before me has graduated or even attended a college i was the first i married a girl who went to college with me and we have done really well for ourselves my parents divorced when i was young my dad job was offshored and my mom sister and i shared a 1 bedroom government subsidized condo thing now my wife and i have live in a 3000 sq ft house in a nice area of town and it often feels really weird to me when my family comes over i feel bad about all the great privileges i have but i see my family members staying stagnant in their lives my wife is the daughter of immigrants her parents for me have always been special to have around because they worked their asses off to pay for her school and just to get here to give her better opportunities i would not think about it in those terms what you wrote about staying stagnant because my guess is that the fact that you are able to travel out of state and have those opportunities is probably something your parents are very proud of it was probably the largest part of their goal for immigrating in the first place if they are anything like my wife parents they probably low key brag about you all the time even if they do not they are still probably very proud i just became a parent myself and i can tell you even if things were not to work out for me so well or i was not economically successful seeing my child have the opportunities you have and successes you have and will likely continue to have would give me more happiness than you can imagine give them hugs if they do that sort of thing call them more often to fill them in on your life if you have that kind of relationship just keep letting them know you love them and appreciate them in any way that you can say thank you more they will appreciate it oh and if you in part mean siblings one of mine has not done as well in terms of education and career success just keep treating them like you always have and do not let your disparities in education and wealth change anything about your relationship and do not pity them people can tell when relationships get that way and i can tell you it will not feel good to them keep it normal be there for them when they need it when you are a doctor treat them for free as an aside marrying into an immigrant family i have developed such an appreciation for what immigrant parents in particular go through navigating a new country often without as much language skill as they need and just doing anything they can for their kids is something i am always in awe of that is to me what is awesome about america not that they can come here or anything or what they come here for but the fact that when they are here and they are just some of the best god damn hard working people i have seen in my life it is so cool i cannot even articulate how i feel about it people like them are what make america such an awesome place to be i bet your parents are proud of you and your success is something they always wanted shower them with appreciation when you can ,7,premed
