ak502,thanks now i am hungry ,3,food
ak502,yup it a bummer but an easy thing to prevent ,1,pics
ak502,honestly a net and practice lol it was ich it a parasite that lives in your sand till it matures and attaches to fish and if not treated can kill them and due to the loaches being always at the bottom and digging in sand for food scraps that got it pretty bad and me being new to it did not catch the signs in time ,2,pics
ak502,well if i pick up or order a fish from a supplier i am not familiar with i will acclimate the fish in a bag placed in my tank like you normally would but after a few minutes letting the temp even out i will add some of my tank water to the bag a few time over an hr or so or till i am satisfied then move the fish from the dirty mixed water bag to a bag with only my tank water after 20 or so dump him in and have much less worry about unwanted guests in your tank i learned this after losing 200 of clown loaches ,1,pics
ak502,yes that a big problem but it an easy fix with feeder fish you just rinse the fish in tap water and dump them in with pet fish you can almost do the same but at a much slower rate ,2,pics
