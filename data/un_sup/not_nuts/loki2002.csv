loki2002,a requirement is something you have to do as a condition of getting the service or benefit tipping is not a requirement under any circumstances is it socially expected in certain areas sure but that does not make it a requirement you want to go out to eat and not tip you can you want to use the services of the doorman without tipping you can you worrying about what others will think of you if you do not do something does not make that something a requirement ,1,todayilearned
loki2002,you have literally not a shred of evidence for what you just accused the fact is trump ordered the go ahead he reviewed the plan and gave the green light to execute it became his the moment he took office it became his when he gave the order this is what a leader would have done 1 accepted responsibility 2 promised to do whatever was necessary to prevent something like this from happening again 3 ordered a thorough review of the incident and planning in order to find out where things went wrong 4 consulted with military and intelligence experts in order to formulate a plan for future operations 5 not been a coward and blamed there other guy ,2,worldnews

loki2002,delegating is a great leadership tool it does not mean you are not aware or not being informed of what is going on if trump wants to run the america like a business than just like any business as the head he is responsible for what happens even if he did not personally do it i did not like the idea of him as president at first but was one those let give him a chance people he lost a lot of my respect when he tried to pass the blame for yemen raid to obama a raid he himself ordered that is not leadership that cowardly whether he likes it or not the buck stops with him ,6,worldnews
loki2002,i never said i was outraged it is not anyone else fault but kushner that he failed to follow proper protocol and the law by choosing to not disclose meetings with russian parties it is also a failure of trump not to hold himself and his staff to a higher standard when it comes to these things the other guy did the same thing is an excuse for schoolchildren had this come out at the time it would have been a huge deal and legitamite grounds for more investigation of obama and his dealongs as it is with now with trump and his team ,3,worldnews

loki2002,people not liking you is not force you choose too the tip the same as the doorman chooses their job two people at the same level can make wildly different commission rates based on what they negotiated when they got the job plus i would argue that variable tips incentivize performance much better than a fixed commission if you get the same amount then as long as the sale is made you are good so there is little need to go above and beyond what is necessary whereas if there is a possibility you will get more if you are do more and go above and beyond you are more likely to ,1,todayilearned

loki2002,the law right now is looking at it based on precedent and laws that were drafted when encryption was not a reality they are trying to apply old world interpretations to a new world reality i want it to go to scotus so they can finally make a ruling on this ,0,technology
loki2002,they have his siter testimony they have the existing un encrypted cp from his computer they have the computer records to show what sites he visited and that files were downloaded from these sites and then transferred to external drives they do not know that the drives the seized are the ones that the information was put on with what they have they could make a case against him already ,2,technology
loki2002,putting in the key is basically deciphering the encryption it is not the same as unlocking your front door without that key the information contained is undecipherable without your house key your house is still the same which is not the same for encrypted files without the encryption key those files are not the same as they would be with it ,1,technology
loki2002,new analogy they had a warrant to seize the hard drives they got the hard drives just as if they had a warrant for your accounting books they got the books but you do not need to explain how to decipher them they are asking him to decipher the encryption on the hard drives which is essentially providing evidence against himself through speech ,0,technology
loki2002,they served a warrant for the hard drives they got the hard drives unlocking them is a completely different thing if they are correct and there is incriminating things on them then the owner is essentially providing testimony against himself by unlocking them they have their evidence they just do not like how it is presented ,0,technology
loki2002,completely different scenario they served the warrant for the hard drives like they would for a house it would be like serving a warrant on a house and expecting the home owner to show you everything incriminating without having to do the search yourself edit made the statement make sense ,2,technology

loki2002,then you get charged with destruction of evidence ,11,technology
loki2002,but they do not know it exists they believe it does if they are able to prove it exists then they do not need it they can present a jury with all the facts and the encrypted hard drives the fact that they seem so intent on decrypting the hard drives seems to indicate something larger at play here like maybe they do not have as strong a case as they claim or they are trying to set a precedent for future prosecutions ,78,technology

loki2002,there has been no testimony since no trial has taken place julian assange assessment of who gave him the information is fine at face value unless you realize that the russians have been at this game for a bit and are not stupid enough not to use a third party to disseminate the information it likely assange has no idea who really have him the information every single intelligence agency in the america agrees that russia directed the hacking even trump after being briefed on friday has accepted that russia hacked at least the dnc they have released two reports now going over their findings as well plus the fact that there is no president that would do what obama did without solid footing it would be a diplomatic nightmare for them and the country whether it had the desired affect on the election or not is irrelevant ,0,The_Donald
loki2002,nobody is saying they hacked the election itself no one claimed they hacked voting machines or other infrastructure the argument is and always has been is that they tried to influence people votes by solely releasing damaging information about the dnc and their chosen candidate if anyone is claiming anything other then they are idiots that deserve to be maligned and ignored i never once claimed trump was illegitamite he won the election and will be president ,1,The_Donald
