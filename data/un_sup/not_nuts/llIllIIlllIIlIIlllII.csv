llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII,relative to a cat experience it is a relief being freed from that hormonal need to mark and mate neutered male cats are calm and happy they do not sit around agonized over their missing testicles rather they are much happier cats with their claws removed however show insecurity and tend to be more withdrawn and less trusting they experience worsening pain as arthritis builds and if they get loose outside they are terrified without the weapons needed to defend themselves crossing the species line means metaphors fail humans also do not like losing their teeth but cats do not use molars much and having diseased molars removed gives them great relief although it would give a human great remorse ,1,science

llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII,well in fact you can seek 90 day and 365 day holds as well but that with everything almost anything involving a dramatic issue comes down to a judge eventually if someone accuses you of assault you could be jailed and you would need a judge to release you if you keep having bad luck with judges or cannot make your case you could be in jail a long time people on mental health holds do get court appointed attorneys to help them escape the 72 hour hold as well as to prevent longer treatment orders mentally ill people are not hung out to dry they get representation and days in court ,2,LateStageCapitalism

llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII,so god intervened to help you get off meth but lets children get killed in mudslides and earthquakes and school shootings and by leukemia or malnutrition if i told you there was a social worker who had the power to save 100 kids from drowning or help one guy get off meth and who had all the time in the world to actually do both what would you say about that social worker who let the kids drown is he a good social worker or not ,1,The_Donald
llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII,a 48 year old can understand suffering and the fact that we are mortal children cannot i am not offended i just think it rude to suggest god is down here helping people when there no evidence for it and as i stated plenty of evidence that his believers are hung out to dry thousands of people have been killed in church collapses alone ,1,The_Donald

llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII,well that did not address my point at all my point is god does not intervene i am not arguing about justice or fairness or judgment or the afterlife i am saying that people pray to god and he ignores them or at the very least he ignores 99 999 of them so why bother asking and a picture like this post implies god or jesus are helping they are not jesus is not in the oval office doing anything and he not in trump heart doing anything if god or jesus exist they are just watching they do not come down here and do anything if they do they are terrible at it ,1,The_Donald
llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII,none of that disproves my point that god does not intervene i did not say anything about justice i just said that you cannot expect that god is answering prayers or helping nudge people along there is zero evidence for that and millennia of evidence against it ,-6,The_Donald
llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII,so all the christian people praying on doomed aircraft all the christian people praying in concentration camps all those christian people praying on the titanic all the christian refugees praying in the middle east as they are being slaughtered all the christian parents of kids with leukemia and on burn units all the praying christian family members of kidnap victims and do not tell me earthquakes and tsunami and tornadoes and hurricanes and genetic diseases are a result of man choices god jesus do not intervene on earth if they do then we should be horrified that they do so very very very very very infrequently and if they are working hard for trump they are really dropping the ball the last few weeks why cannot jesus get justice for seth rich ,-6,The_Donald

llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII,rent control means a price is set and cannot be changed prices are designed to reflect the balance of supply and demand when supply is less than demand price goes up when supply is more than demand price goes down when you force a price for one thing to stay low despite increasing demand that causes the price of other similar things to go up so keeping numbers extremely basic let say you are a landlord and have ten units let say it costs you 10 000 to manage that building a month so you would charge 1000 month so you can cover your expenses 1000 x 10 10 000 but the government comes along and says five of those units are rent controlled you cannot charge more than 600 month for those units well if that the case then you are only collecting 8 000 month but need to cover 10 000 in expenses so what do you do you raise the rent on those those other five units by 400 so half the place pays 600 month and the other half pays 1400 month thus rent control caused a price hike ,2,funny

llIllIIlllIIlIIlllII,the most plausible explanation is the mob did it joe kennedy who was a dirty dirty dude got the mafia to deliver votes for jfk in chicago which put him over the top in 1960 then the kennedys did nothing to pay back that favor you do not screw over the mob they killed jfk and then killed oswald to end the story why else would jack ruby a mobster kill oswald it makes the most sense plus at the time people realized jfk almost got us into nuclear war with the cuban missile crisis they were scared lots of people may have felt justified in killing him again the biggest clue is ruby silencing oswald i think the mafia hired oswald and ruby made sure the government could not get oswald to rat them out ,-1,history
