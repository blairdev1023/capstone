Murdervermin,positivity is the unspoken policy of human culture do not pity them they cannot help themselves and pitying yourself is equally pointless stupid counter productive etc and take it easy on yourself ,1,depression
Murdervermin,how can you trust yourself to judge that especially if you were depressed 0 o,1,creepy
Murdervermin,the void has been there as long as we have existed as conscious repression assumes more brutal tactics and forms to accommodate larger jaded swaths of humanity the rest keep asserting the same solutions god politics genocide etc ,1,creepy
Murdervermin,after just finding this sub seeing a lot of posts regarding people illusions of happiness w o even reading this your post you are probably right in the most obnoxious and saccharine ways ,1,depression
Murdervermin,yo you still around i can join ya wanna give me a pw ,1,tombprospectors
Murdervermin,the polished granite tomohawk was my first magic weapon on my mistake of a ranger back in 99 it was amazing to be able to start killing willow wisps ,1,project1999
Murdervermin,heya i am late to the party here and while i recently blew all my money i would love to buy an ot hammer off ya in a few days when i have enough pp drop me a line if and when you can thanks ,1,project1999
Murdervermin,bingo do not think i am gonna use this one weapon and this one stance which is the main feel of dark souls a few weapons but a limited moveset in nioh there are abilities that work and jive with each other and other abilities and it creates a really high skill ceiling for players to figure out what comobs stances and weapons to use and you should be using all of them the stances combos etc for your build at any given time ,2,Nioh
Murdervermin,it not as simple as git gud it learning that this is not to be played like souls the skill ceiling is much higher in nioh so it will take some adjustments but nioh rewards knowing how to combo the stances ki pulse while dodging and swipping weapons and stances and if anything the combat is closer to bloodborne i just call em all souls but with the potential to be even more aggressive and the need to utilize more weapons and movesets and abilities in the span of one encounter or one enemy than the souls games with blocking as needed without a shield i cannot remember the name of the guy and the video but some dude posted a video here called demons must die he makes it look easy but it seemed he had already mastered the game in the early demo accesses and what you see is the potential nioh has for combat and it pretty amazing found it as you improve the game and combat can look and feel more like this which is quite different from souls and what that implies to a souls fan at first glance i hope it makes you drool a bit and his other videos against some of the bosses are pretty amazing too d https www youtube com watch v ps0vgoctwyg,3,Nioh
Murdervermin,my regular builds are 120 but as recommended by slim the dude who did the in depth arcane guides here i did my arcane build at level 150 which allows for 99 arcane and no resistances have never been much of a problem in fact by the time i had 50 arcane with a call beyond and some of the other weapons and tools it trivialized most bosses including f r c chalice dungeon bosses far more than even my str whirligig build ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,yup funny that fromsoft ruined 99 of all other action rpgs for me and now nioh has raised that bar even higher i seriously doubt nioh will be remotely as intriguing and engrossing to me as the souls games were and are when it comes to characters story telling and mystery but if we are honest a lot of video game stories and delivery are lackluster and unoriginal and what i crave more than anything thanks to from is just solid combat mechanics the rest of the game can be mediocre just give me solid high risk high reward gameplay hard but fair is a good bar and nioh seems to have set a new bar there and the skill ceiling is going to be much higher in this game even if the story and lack of a connected world and other elements take from the game or are kind of lame the combat and play itself felt pretty solid so far ,1,Nioh
Murdervermin,yeah i already have 20 in my wallet and i think the ps store is just shit when it comes to trying payments from multiple sources this happens every time i try this i think some of the highest damage i saw in game was from the kusarigama but then again a lot of people were quite clumsy and clearly unaccustomed to the game myself included so it hard to gauge that but from what others have posted it seems dex ninjitsu magic light armor are all pretty powerful at the moment i wish i would have found some of the skills and things sooner myself ie backstab on the ninjitsu tree and i also wish i had more time to utilize flux and weapon swaps while i did get the hang of the basics and stuff like basic ki pulsing dodge ki pulsing some of the combos and mechanics etc i still missed out on maximizing combat with flux and weapon swaps but after seeing some videos i see the potential and it all really raises the skill ceiling for this game now i am bummed we have to wait a few more weeks to play it ,1,Nioh
Murdervermin,yeah it seems that way wish i had more time to try a ninja build but if this winds up being the case then ninja will likely get the nerf bat and or medium and heavy armor weapon builds will probably be buffed i mean more than anything it a bummer when the balance winds up being so off because no one wants to lag behind and then aspects of the game are wasted as the majority of players will shun the weaker builds since they cannot compete with the op ones but i guess the real answer is we will see ,1,Nioh
Murdervermin,i just looked up warlords but nothing similar to what you mentioned is coming up what system console is it for thanks ,1,Nioh
Murdervermin,loved it played like a brawler fighting game meets diablo and satisfying souls esque combat weighty committed movement pretty solid but more in depth this was my first time playing it and while i got into the game groove and beat everything available solo i am far from mastering the system was hard to utilize flux and weapon swap well but i did not realize they were a thing till the beta demo was all but over after i soloed all the missions i went for some jolly co op on the twilight mission and man it was fun as hell but it never lasted long before me or the host got creamed this game has a much higher skill ceiling than others of it kind and i can only imagine how hard the pvp and even co op will be as a result but given time for players to get better and master the game and it mechanics i am sure it will be a blast ,1,Nioh
Murdervermin,yup gotta say twilight mission was a pain in the ass but i still beat it i was using axes and hammers on my build and the highest hammer i found was close to 300 damage before even maxing it out with familiarity and those enemies still had way too many hp but i dig it reminds me of chalice dungeons on bb which a lot of people hated but that sort of thing is right up my alley what weapons were you maining also could you make much sense of the stats some of it was clear and obvious but i could not make sense of a good 3 4 of them so like most games with randomized loot i generally went with highest defense offence numbers edit p s i enjoyed the game so much that i decided to pre order it now but as usual every time i try to buy a game on the ps store things bug out it wo not accept my payments etc have you tried ordering it and if so did it actually work for you seriously i hate ps store and network it bugs out every single time i try to buy something from them ,1,Nioh
Murdervermin,thanks i get what you mean the first hour or two was pretty slow and painful but then it totally clicked between making this post and playing the game i finally got in the groove beat the oggress on my 2nd or third try and then i had a few failed attempts to mugadishi general before i realized my agility was c and once i swapped it to b with lighter armor then he was pretty easy and i got him on my first or second go i did not even see that you could scroll down the skill menus and i had missed a lot of things on the ninja and magic skill menus too like backstab but now i have some good stuff unlocked and the game play is quite rewarding and fun been enjoying the heavy weapons namely the axe and the range weapons are pretty cool too pretty satisfying blowing off someone head ,1,Nioh
Murdervermin,i have been trying to figure out the combat in this game in practice and reading and while i have improved i am still trying to play it too much like the souls series and i mean bb too at times i think i am making more sense of it and that is the combat is just paced a bit differently and i also have not had the time to learn enemy attack patterns to best utilize ki pulse and attacks so i wind up ki pulsing even though i am already about to dodge away to not be hit so for me at present half the time it just feels like a mechanic i cannot use but with your post it makes sense the other thing that makes it hard to guage is enemies that kind of just poise through my attacks so even though i ki pulse to attack more it wo not mattter because the enemy will just hit me right back that being said where is the ki while dodging skill found is it tied to weapons so far the only skills i have seen are those tied to weapons but i read that armors have skills too also while i am here i have been looking for general hints and information because i am definitely a bit overwhelmed here but any solid pointers or must know information i should know thanks in advance for your time ,1,Nioh
Murdervermin,this game is harder in the sense that das was hard the first time i played it but by the time i did 1bro run even o s did not seem that hard and each subsequent game seemed a bit easier i am glad to have a new challenge though and right now i am not used to the mechanics and controls hardest part has been hitting r1 r2 time and time again wondering why i am not attacking ,2,Nioh
Murdervermin,i can only imagine as i havent done the dlc yet that fight is bs enough with 3 health bars to deplete on a regular run can be obnoxious enough ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,learn his moves then parry him and parse out your damage if you do it right he will only have 1 3 to 1 4 of his health by the time he makes his double manage your sta and use your whole bar on him and his phantom should be able to hit both at the same time and the phantom should only have one or two hits to go if you can survive this ridiculous onslaught for another minute while killing his phantom there should only be a few hits left on him and you should be able to drain him especially if he stops to summon a second phantom ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,the chalice bosses are by far the worst i did not have patience for chalice rom so i did the blood pellet strategy of forcing him into stage 3 asap and doing the fight in 3 minutes instead of 30 minutes by the time you are at the next chalice it already a nightmare because even though you can play more aggressive in bb which mapped out shitty in das3 play style you realize how ridiculous the chalice bosses hp pools are to me bb4 run 3 4 of the main game is absurdly easy but hell even the wet nurse and logarius seemed easy compared to the tank that is the beast possessed soul of ailing loran level 1 and of course the dlc is painful but manageable i liked das3 level 1 run for much of the game but the fun falls off once bosses and enemies get infinite stamina and start doing all but endless combos in aggression that tops most bloodborne enemies and of course the key is knowledge and patience but it less fun once enemies stop playing by the rules of the game like you said das1 is a joke in comparison even o s seem easy compared to do many das3 bossss das2 actually want that bad i did about 1 2 of it back when but started again a few weeks ago on a sotfs run iron keep is stupid but honestly it seemed super easy and now all i have left is velstaldt vendrick and the last bosses of the game to best and sinh too but fuck him i have never even made it past the bullshit hitbox of his first swoop attack in the few times i tried ,5,darksouls3
Murdervermin,any time for a fungi ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,there a newer content producer who puts out the most thorough and rigorous lore videos i have ever seen if that up your alley check out hawkshaw i think that their name it a two man team and they put together a comprehensive time line in one of their videos that is worth watching as well as a video about the way of white in which they thoroughly dissect the dark sign origins and they cover more than just the little around leeroy they cover it thoroughly and in depth i didnt think id believe that lore proposition myself but they kinda floored me and i thought there just could not be any more revelatory lore content about the first game but hawk challenges a lot of that and the evidence was compelling enough to convince me at the very least if you are into this shit as much as i am and i suspect you are you will definitely appreciate their work ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yep and in essence it is not even change in dark souls 2 it was just further expounded upon and it seems even more clear when we take into account how much is forgotten or convoluted by the passing of countless ages when they say accursed one in dark souls 2 i think that just what they call undead in this age since the idea is spread that the dark sign is a curse but that is the god point of view but this is subject to where people stand on what the curse really is there is a lot of compelling evidence that the dark sign was manufactured by humans it wasnt an accident a fluke or a curse but a weapon created by the way of white ,3,darksouls3
Murdervermin,there actually a lot of evidence that the dark sign and the undead curse were not accidents or something like a sickness but rather manufactured likely by the way of white in this sense the dark sign has always been manufactured and yoel infusing or granting the dark sign to the unkindled one to turn him undead further backs this idea up it just never been all that well explore or discussed as people seek to take a lot of the unreliable game narration especially from the god perspectives as truth i mean the gods saw the curse as a threat since the power of that sort of immortality could and would be their undoing the questions would be did the curse spread beyond the control of those who created it or was that the intention especially to give humanity a fighting chance against te lord endless cycles of fire i mean the whole premise of the series is that the gods denied humanity their age and seemingly fucked the world up in ways we still are not clear on frampt was merely a traitor who took gwyn side and the dark stalkers just seem to be agents of the dark trying to manipulate us as well i think the dark has been there in some capacity yearning to overthrow the age of fire since te beginning and t has manifested in numerous ways but the ages seem to be transitory anyway nether few nor dark ages last ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yup and the final step in the process is either losing sight of forgetting or failing at whatever purpose or mission is keeping you alive as for londo the city of hollows i imagine havin that community and purpose of it keeps the undead there fresher and longer like a freezer bag for your undead i also love what little info they give us on the city that the hollows are seen as deceitful since they wear those rings that keep ones appearance as alive rather than undead but in the process they often believe the lies themselves i think they give a lot of character and an idea of the underlying fear and desperation in just a few lines ,4,darksouls3
Murdervermin,i do not think it that far of a stretch given how messed up the game is the world is and the first flame is after countless cycles the unkindled are basically a new breed nothing more and nothing less ,6,darksouls3
Murdervermin,an udead hollows eventually but the process of hollowing does not make an undead a full on hollow a hollow lacks or loses sight of their purpose be it by failure or something else and that has always been the last stage of hollowing the game references that with their essential mission in the hollow city of londo hollows even forget that they themselves are hollow using the white rings to fool others and even themselves when i envision this place i do see the occasional or frequent citizen going mad but i also imagine that the purpose of creating and living in a place of their own staves off the final stages of hollowing at least for a bit ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,ha liar not our fault from set a new standard that we did not know we were craving now if only other combat rpg games were as good as the souls series but there are a few promising looking games coming up in the next year or so ,0,darksouls3
Murdervermin,cool thanks ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yeah i was just playin around with mugen monkey now and for making a more hybrid build that utilizes more powerful sorcery it seems that i would definitely want more int and more attunement rather than respeccing my main level 120 toon i think i will resume playing the mage character i made and focus on leveling him to 140 150 for a better build i would still love to see what you suggest for a jedi build that can use the 50 int requirement spells and still be decent fighters thanks for your response ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,heya i wanted to make a build like this purely for pve aside invaders at a meta level of 120 for optimal frieda scythe damage with a backup weapon light armor and decent attunement for more fp and spell slots what do you think this build would look like i mean it a bummer to me that between attunement estus allotment and stamina usage and game speed pure magic builds and even hybrids have to sacrifice so much but i just wanted to mix up my build for my extra play through ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,how is the friede scythe build how many of the weapon art moves do or dont use fp and how is the damage on the scythe itself i was thinking about doing some sort of hybrid sorcery melee build but i have not really looked into what that build would look like with optimal effect ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,lol the handmaiden does not die but she does increase her prices d,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yeah the souls games basically ruined all action rpgs for me now most combat in other games just feels like shit too floaty easy not enough heft or consequence or weight and often too flashy not to mention how easy and crappy other games feel in the light of from superior products i mean that not to say other games are not enjoyable or that they cannot be appreciated for what they are but from set a new standard for me and the gaming industry period imo and now most other games just feel like crap in comparison often due to lame mechanics and a lack of difficulty and risk vs reward ,27,darksouls3
Murdervermin,i think the information and proof is in the name pus of man i think humanity is subject to it and nothing else especially since we only see it in humanity hollows gundyr and the speculated ascended knights that are now dragons i mean dragons seem to be long gone aside their descendants like wyverns or drakes we see bodies everywhere around the high wall but those would be the ascended bodies of former knights who likely died in the civil war as for the dragon kin lothric hunted the motivation could be that they hunted the dragons until they realized they could harness that power for themselves by ascending to dragons there are several living bodies seated at the transportation point to arch dragon peak what looks to be black hands or some sort of hollow thief iirc as well as a lothric knight and possibly a drakeblood knight but i would have to double check but i am pretty sure one is a lothric knight as for the lore as a whole it is quite convoluted and muddled but that kid of the point with countless cycles passing with so much legend and myth and reality lost and created over time it a culmination of the dark souls universe so go figure that it would be that much harder to sort out the only thing i really do not like and have a hard time making sense of is the ret con or at least what would have to be ret com if we didnt rely on pure and wild speculation ie ornstein smough being called a knight and elizabeth and ollacile being the swamp which used to be dark root a long time ago which had no elizabeth or remains of oolacile and now all of a sudden it back countless cycles later i mean it can all be explained away quite convincingly but such speculation is rooted in conjecture and not in game proof ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,lol this is both awesome and absurd i always take a little pride and a lot of satisfaction in my onebro runs but all this ng no hit all boss ladle run with a guitar hero controller is insane well done man ,-1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yup it a new story in the same old cycle a lowly outsider destroying and taking over a whole kingdom and i cant help but wonder what his end game plan was because he just winds up king fuck of shitty ash mountain like whats it matter when everythif has gone to shit being that he comes from the painting it seems like he doest understand any of that but i digress the best part of the story or at least a very intriguing part of it imo is who people believe rosaria is and her motives and also where gwynovere is ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,i think lothric is connected to the dragons in the sense that they rode dragons but dragons were practically gone so they became dragons this is why the dragons in the barracks were infected with the pus of man they were not true dragons but knights who became dragons i do not know when oceirus obsession took over and as ypu suggested i think sully probably helped fuel this obsession and sullyvan would be more than happy with the king retiring and giving up on the flame as it was one more part of the kingdom and royal family that sully pretty much destroyed what im not sure on is if sullyvan discovered the path of the dragon or if oceirus did first i think it was oceirus though as riding adcended dragons was their thing or which events occurs first but my main point is i do not think dark souls 3 lore is as bad or lacking or even as convoluted as many seem to think ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yeah even though emma is old she is part of one of the pillars of lothric so she clearly has some razzle dazzle cleric magic and once she gone i think she was killed by a black hand no idea who though i think the dancer just follows up her next mission kill anyone who tries to reach the princes ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,the pontiff does not want to kill the princes in fact an item description says a scholar helped convinced the prince to not link the flame and given sully vast influence through te archives and castle i think that scholar was sullyvan he does not need to kill the prices because they are already working in tandem ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,he couldnt get to the princes at this point in the story even if he wanted emma keeps the dancer in check somehow if you pay attention to the window next to where the dancer spawns it glows with a brilliant blue light once emma is dead or you kill her emma cannot maintain her shield and the dancer spawns in out of her fetal black liquid or whatever it is ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yeah for all the jazz about aldritch the main villain primary mover in this game is sully his influence is seen from the beginning of the game to the very end a lot of people speculate that the scholar who helped convince prince lothric to not link the flame as mentioned in an item description is possibly aldia but with sullyvan influence all through out the castle an the grand archives i am convinced its sully to answer op question the short answer is that sullyvan wants to maintain his kingdom and power and linking the flame stands in direct opposition to that ,5,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yeah the main game seems way easy in comparison i have projects in the chalices atm have not even able to kill forgotten madmen yet since they either stagger me to death or one shot me also been trying beast possessed soul in ailing loran 1 which sounds stupid but he has so much hp i got him down to about 15 last night so i will probably finish him tonight certain bosses i am not worried about just because i am already so familiar with them and have fought them on low level runs and a zillion times in frc chalices amygdalas hot dog etc but i know it an endurance test with their massive hp pools ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i used pellets on both regular rom and rom in the chalices but i did not and do not use them on most other bosses the first half to 3 4 o the game are fairly easy imo so they were not necessary but at a certain point most bosses can and will one shot you so you have to play flawlessly anyhow so at that point beast blood pellets help problem is you have to be patient or be punished hard so building up the beast blood meter like you can do easily on rom is not an option at least until you learn what moves to punish bosses for i imagine the beast blood pellets are a must for the defiled chalices and some of the other lower depth chalices i am on loran level 1 of the story chalices and beast possessed soul seems to have 372837478 hp and can stagger you to death when he is not 1 shorting you so maybe a beast blood pellet is in order since i tend to play drunk and aggressive as for general suggestions you have to learn the bosses as there are few cases where you can just derp through it like you can at higher levels with ample health and stamina and damage from there be patient be aggressive when you can use consumables to your advantage and be sure to take a break if and when you stop having fun while most d the bosses were one and 2 shot endeavors for me plenty of them were projects i worked on for a few hours at a time with long breaks in between playing i still have a bunch more to go too many of which i am not looking forward to a lot of the chalice and dlc bosses ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,rom in the chalice was even better just kidding it made me want to kill myself ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,hehe finally whooped logarius and wet nurse last night after bein stuck on them for a day or two just beat the blood letting beast in the chalices a few day before now i am stuck on loran layer 1 beast possessed soul of all things he not necessarily that hard but most of his shit one shots me and i tend to play drunk so going flawless is quite hard i am also stuck on the forgotten assholes in hintertombs such a bullshit fight two super endurance hunters who can 1 shot me or stagger me to death with all their attacks i should probably do that one sober ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,some of us sadists actually like taking our meta level characters through the ridiculous layouts of f r c dungeons the loot does not matter but fighting the watchdog of the old lords in an oil swamp or three undead giants at the same time is jolly brutal fun ,5,bloodborne
Murdervermin,a 60 99 arc build is fun as hell there also some great dlc weapons to make builds around the str weapons from the dlc are probably my favorite of all the games and bt builds are fun too with a new skill and strength bt weapon available as well ,5,bloodborne
Murdervermin,any time let me know if you find or create any other stupid hard or interesting chalices i have collected a bunch of materials so i will probably make a few new ones when i have time over the holiday weekend will share them if they are interesting or contain a lot of materials ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,hell yeah thank you fellow sadist i will make these tonight i cannot remember the specifics of the following dungeons but there were a lot of ritual materials in the f r c isz and 4 layers too and it was either the loran or the ihyll that had some painful and cool moments they are are all frc cuz why the hell else would you play lots of materials 4 layer isz 5zuzy2nr loran ht2vmakp ihyll aew49wxi and bonus one this is not mine and it from some old spread sheet somewhere tp i think but it the best loran i have ever played it has a very cool lay out and some fun enemy placements without some of the stupidly sadistic rooms like the one you mentioned frc loran jvz8469j i also found an ihyll code from some old spread sheet that has a watch dog of the old lords wandering around in an oil swamp of all places let me know if you want it and if you have not played it before ,3,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i found das easier das2 clunkier due to large bizarre hit boxes and the lack of iframes took some getting used to still working on my das3 run not too bad so far and bloodborne was not too bad either but there were a few major walls and while a lot of the main game bosses were easy logarius and the chalice bosses were not ,1,onebros
Murdervermin,you sure ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,those are good points if they are showing multiple time lines were not sure what is when even the first even of the show dolores ring investigated i think that is from the end of the show time line but it just a hunch as for the pic of her being assembled do you remember when it was on the show was ford talking about the old models like a voice over on those scenes i want to say that was the implication but i could be way off ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,either way starbuck being a mysterious angel entity that died then reappeared then disappeared just pissed me off i would have rather her just been a cylon as it fits the universe more than random deuche ex machina angel ,2,westworld
Murdervermin,ah right the old hosts i misread that ,2,westworld
Murdervermin,it was said that the original hosts were mechanical robots essentially but the newer models of hosts are in fact made out of flesh and bone medical technology is just that advanced in this future and apparently building cyborgs is more cost effective than building robots ,2,westworld
Murdervermin,yeah i think there are lots of other elements to imply multiple time lines but this is not one of them ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,yeah but it was too much deuce ex machina and religious mumbo jumbo for me clarified below in a show that while sci fi was rooted in plausible science fiction and a mirror of the human psyche all the good and bad therein to be clear i think the superstitions and religious aspects of the people and all their attendant beliefs and rituals was a fantastic element of the show and the universe but to see it come true in certain ways was just a tad bit much for me but then again it was some far flung science fiction fungineering so i guess i am being a bit absurd for criticizing it as such to be more concise i think the writing and plots along those lines could have been tighter because much of the show was tight and on point but it just seemed too lazy easy and absurd for me ,3,westworld
Murdervermin,yeah i saw that looks like arnold is a cylon i mean robot i mean alien i mean tyler durden i mean he a host ,0,westworld
Murdervermin,the dichotomy is a minor point hence i pointed out the nuances of ford genuine anger ford does not speak too much about arnold does he aside the creation process arnold contributions to the business and a few other points he says little about him and no one has replaced arnold have they arnold built a replica of ford family for him they were as the show has demonstrated geniuses in their field and work unique irreplaceable apex minds i imagine they might even have been best friends or at the least comrades with a deep connection through their work work that others can hardly come close to behind it all i think this show is more about ford and what he created and reconciling or coming to terms with what he lost in the process more than anything else but they just do not beat us over the head with it and mercifully so the implications are there and so far it seems like bernard is a cylon i mean an alien i mean a robot i mean a host and i think ford has plenty of plausible and genuine character driven reasons to have created him yes ford is angry he is angry at arnold angry that he lost him to his madness and angry that there is no bringing him back or replacing him and he is angry at himself and arnold more than anyone else interactions or bullshit regarding the hosts ,2,westworld
Murdervermin,thanks looks like bernard is indeed a cylon i mean alien i mean psychotic split personality i mean robot i mean host ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,yeah i think i had it wrong shit looks like bernard is indeed a cylon i mean a split personality i mean a host ahhhhh ,2,westworld
Murdervermin,without looking at the photo because i do not want to lose track of the post an easy confirmation is the difference of how they are built iirc the photo shows robot insides and them being segmented is an out dates process compared to how they are molded out of flesh and bone on those white circular wheel devices remember one of the characters says they used to be robots but are now flesh and bone attaching the head in such a manner implies it was her original robot model and not the new flesh and bone models so i think the picture is proof that it is in the past ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,i do not care for the he a robot thing myself but to counter what you said it could just be ford own characterological conflict as he winds up being a man of contradictions he says he not sentimental but he keeps his family as hosts that arnold built for him iirc no less making him even more sentimental in terms of arnold and others attitudes towards the robots ford becomes quite angry at this insisting the hosts are not real but he could be truly mad at this because deep down inside he wants them to be real or wishes them to be or maybe he telling himself that and not the others because he wants to believe otherwise or hell maybe ford has tried himself but cannot come as close as arnold did in this endeavor your thoughts ,2,westworld
Murdervermin,oh shit maybe it was ford then my bad damn i was hoping westworld was not doing the he a robot thing common in these sort of stories that being said i guess my memory is that skewed but that sounds like the scene i was thinking of what episode was that in by the way ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,hmmm my memory could be wrong but i am pretty sure yours might be wrong too and i think you are thinking of a different scene the scene i am thinking of is bernard interrogating delores and he was following this hunch almost seeming hopeful that arnold was still somehow in touch with delores and the hosts like he was seeking more information on arnold codes shit now i am more curious to find the scene and see if my memory which i usually pride myself on is in fact correct or very skewed d either way i know human memory is very fallible but i am also hoping westworld does not delve into the all too common tropes in these sort of stories that everyone or the important characters are cylons robots hosts aliens alternate personalities 1 ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,people seem caught up on the photo and the theoretical age gaps and the expectation is that bernard would be an older an appropriately aged arnold as opposed to a 30 some odd year younger ford in the photo and the arnold that we and bernard do not see in the photo but the logical conclusion if bernard is in fact an arnold host would be that bernard is not a now 30 year older arnold but rather that bernard is a younger arnold somewhere around arnold age at the time of death and the photo and since everyone worked hard to take arnold name and face off the project and the business few to no one could identify bernard as a younger or slightly older arnold as for the verbal evidence of people asking bernard have not you been here forever well it does not mean anything because ford could have programmed bernard to think that and told everyone else the same that bernard has been there a long time ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,i posted this question already but it makes no sense that if these interrogation scenes were of arnold and delores many years ago then why does arnold ask delores about arnold death and her las communication with him to which she says something like 40 35 years ago this question and answer means it is bernard asking these questions not the theorized younger arnold though bernard could still be a host of arnold it would just rule out these interrogations as being arnold and delores in the past ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,but he is the sentimental type keeping his family alive in the park and all that ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,it got worse when it went from they are cylons to now they are immortal angelic entities goddamn that pissed me off d,10,westworld
Murdervermin,great theory write up evidence and observations but at a glance i see a very large hole in your biggest evidence going off my memory at the moment if all of the interrogation scenes with clothed delores in the basement are in arnold past not bernard arnold host present then why would arnold even ask delores about her last communication with arnold which she answers with 35 years ago or whatever it was you said all these interrogation scenes are all the same out of place in the weird basement area but consistent or not it makes no sense for real past arnold to ask about his own death since it has not happened yet and since he would not need to only bernard theoretical arnold host would ask that question anyone have any thoughts or ideas about this on a related note to solidify the theory and clear some things up people seem caught up on the photo and the theoretical age gaps and the expectation is that bernard would be older arnold as opposed to a 30 some odd year younger arnold that we and bernard do not see in the photo but the logical conclusion if bernard is in fact an arnold host would be that bernard is not a now 30 year older arnold but rather bernard is a younger somewhere around arnold age at the time of death 40 50 like younger ford in the pic ,1,westworld
Murdervermin,it funny that the church considered it forbidden and yet the password and gatekeeper were on byrgynwyrth side and laurence knew the adage and thus the password so i have a hard time reconciling the lore and game mechanics at this juncture worth noting that the choir had a spy in byrgynwyrth but i do not know if she was there to just steal intelligence or make sure no one found rom or hell being that the factions of mensis the choir byrg and even the church were at odds we can only speculate what each truly knew about each other minus a few givens in game ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,yes there are less armor sets and weapons however i fell in love and enjoyed and used as much or more armor i mean fashion in bb as i did the souls series as for the weapons as fun as it is having 30 greatswords 40 straight swords 50 hammers etc how many of them does the a average souls player wind up really using and favoring how many are actually that unique or different and sure a wider dearth depending on the characters and builds but i found the weapons in this game to be quite satisfying and just like das i only truly favored a few weapons on each build with there being a primary i fall in love with and use above all else anyhow bb was no different in this regard as for where to go keep exploring i suggest you play as blind as possible bb has plenty of replay value so you can always look for what you missed in ng or on another build you will have plenty of time to do that but you only get one blind play through with all the shocks and horrors and frustrations of the souls games d,3,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i would suggest a blind playthrough with skill str or a quality build since arcane and blood tinge builds favor game knowledge of where to get what and how to best utilize it which requires either discovering it on your own or spoiling the game via the wikis and forums ,3,bloodborne
Murdervermin,true and while the paleblood hunt has some great stuff in there people talk about it as if it canon while plenty of it leans very heavily on conjecture and speculation and filling in the gaps as we are all left to do ,4,bloodborne
Murdervermin,the ghermalyn gatling gherman the gherminator shit i think i am out of ideas d,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,not the dizziness the only thing i noticed is that yes 30 fps sucks compared to 60fps d,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,funny i came to associate it with a matrix esque sort of dramatic flair as well and it became a very satisfying pavlovian response the rest of the drop rates and blur sucks though though after das 1 and 2 it was what was expected ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,does the ps4 run das3 at 60fps i heard it only did 30 with some stuttering as i heard xbox was even worse at times ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,nooo play blind do not rob yourself the experience of game enemies and npcs and and experiences and surprises you only get one shot at that bb has plenty of replay value so you could always build a quality or str or skill build to start then come back around for one of the other builds later the way this game is set up arcane and bt builds are limited in weapons and items and the better blood gems til much later in the game and for the most part they do not seem to be newb friendly or intended for first playthroughs at least if you plan to stick to level range metas ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i just said this yesterday but it one of the best 500 bucks i ever spent by the time you get bb the dlc and 6 12 months of ps you are about 300 bucks in but i am guessing you are already familiar with the souls games most fans log hundreds of hours so i imagine you could easily get that kinda mileage and for a dollar an hour little else can compete point is i am saying it worth it d,3,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i prefer pc if games are available there the biggest glare i noticed going back to bb from das 3 is no 60fps ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i agree especially when you consider the dollar value per entertainment hour spent but if you tell someone you bought a 400 game system for just one video game even plenty of gamers would be like whoa that a lot ,0,bloodborne
Murdervermin,ditto best 500 some odd dollars i ever spent d and i mostly mean that seriously aside how ridiculous that sounds bb wound up being one of my favorite games of all times and i think it even pulls just a bit ahead of dark souls for me too ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i bought a bloodborne player since no bb for the pc and i will tell you that it probably my favorite game of all time and as much as i loved and still love dark souls between the game play and story of bb it just wound up clicking with me and fascinating me far more than any other game for the most part i still do not like the invader and coop bell system would have preferred the same old or similar soapstone invasion system from souls but that just the way the game is ,4,bloodborne
Murdervermin,it is my favorite hp quote too and i think it pegs human fear irrationality weakness and limitation more concisely than anyone or anything else we have this uncanny ability to see and understand ourselves more than amy other animal we know of yet people have an impossible time attempting to do so and psychologically they crumble before better and honest judgment and scientific study that fear is at the root of our existence and has shaped our evolution did you ever read his essay supernatural horror in literature he discusses said fear in depth there and it is one of his best pieces if not his best work in my opinion i also believe he predicted the future in that dark age comment we have more knowledge and access to it among all manners of other data history statistics and so forth and more than enough information and minds to put it together to come up with a more unified theory and understanding regarding the human animal but just about everyone balks at it and refuses the notion and you cannot even suggest the idea to someone before they refuse it in insisting that we are special little snowflakes or agents of the cosmos or god or etc point is people are content to fully study and dissect and be honest about all other animals on this planet except the human animal people flew from that shit like the plague they insist we cannot know we should not know but i think it bullshit ,2,bloodborne
Murdervermin,great summary of the plot you and i have pretty similar visions in piecing together the stoey we know the scourge predates the city of yharnam and byrg and their events as evidenced by loran but the nightmare itself is the curse imo the rest of it the contract the hunt the baby great ones and the replacement surrogates i see it all as the mere mating strategy of the great ones the surrogates are the birthed great ones not the initial babies but it just takes lots of atrocities and blood and bodies for the great ones to successfully reproduce the locations in the hunter nightmare do not tell us much in and of themselves as they are all nightmare manifestations so physical location becomes less important but the symbology and order remains behind maria death we find what else they were hiding though i do not think i worded this part particularly well as far as the fishing hamlet goes i think both byrg anf the healing church went there post laurence split sending their own agents with their own methods and those cursing them probably do not know or care what the differences are and remember that if gherman and maria were still being utilized there as the church agents then this was in the earlier days of the beast scourge when the hunters operated at night as unknown and discrete entities to clean up the church mess in quiet funny that gherman is the first hunter of the church and ludwig is also the first hunter of the healing church one was the men in black cleanup crew and ludwig became the public heroic face of the church when they could no longer keep the beast plague under wraps which was a hell of a pr move your thoughts i also have a few other orphans of ideas i think the cleric beast brador killed was laurence and brador replaced laurence as the primary keeper of church secrets if it is indeed laurence skull in the grand cathedral the reason he does not have horns is because brador scalped him also being that brador has what appears to be the foreigner garb and based on his dialogue do you think he knew us or just knew of us since he possibly came from the same place ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,at face value in the economy of ideas that has been and remains our rich primate heritage it is ideas and concepts that matter the most not the messengers racism is a problem in so called civilized society but it amuses me to no end that people talk about it as if it new that somehow after thousands of years of perpetual war hatred slavery exploitation and racism across all of the globe that somehow people think they can make it go away or change what millions and thousands of years of terrifying survival and evolution have done to us or change our heritable traits or the fact that we are not remotely fair or rational or nice animals by nature and design i get it though people have long needed carrots before their donkeys and this holds true for both the crusaders and the evil cretins he rallies against and this is made clear as day light in the west especially when compared to the greater horrors of humanity the atrocities and ignorance and superstitions that rule the 3rd and 4th worlds and the age of abundance and the slowly dying age of optimism leads people to such lofty and hopeful ideals but those remain just that ideals and feelings that have never and will never map onto reality at least in the ways people hope they will but that is just not the human animal reality is people are nether apes myopic blind short sighted driven solely by instincts they guise as free will stupid greedy and insatiable unable and unwilling to question their fragile psyches and weak egos perpetually asleep living lives of lies culminations of primal myths and modern delusion blindly pushing forward in progress and history has been written and continues to be written in this manner what so many people fail to give lovecraft credit for typically those staring at the sj side of things is that he pushed his characters to those limits the limits of their understanding and egos something most people cannot even fathom doing be they racists or anti racists lovecraft at least posed himself these questions which is more than most people dare to do the racist and anti racist have far more in common than either can dare admit their shared irrationality that stems from the same place their faith in their own ideologies and skewed perceptions of reality and their equally ludicrous claims and beliefs to superiority genetic superiority for the racist and moral superiority for the anti racist and yet both remain unsympathetic uncaring unloving and judgmental towards mankind both his limitations and his capacities neither truly cares about what is right or wrong in manners of principles or as more complex nuanced and pragmatic ideals and obtuse truths but rather they are concerned with the notion that they and their vision of reality are correct just and good here is a good note to end on a quotation by hpl that sums up the absurd animal that is man the most merciful thing in the world i think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents we live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity and it was not meant that we should voyage far the sciences each straining in its own direction have hitherto harmed us little but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age the importance of the face value of concepts and ideas did you know that you are living in that new dark age best to forget it though cling to one carrots and not peek one head to far above the covers ,6,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i beat vicar amelia onsight my first go d also killed her easy on two different 4 bro runs ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i have yet to make it to the defiled chalice on either of my bl4 toons some day ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,every lore interpretation is different aside the concrete information we find in game and from redgrave to vaati so many of the theories and lore videos inevitable rely on speculation and interpretation rather than certainty what exactly was the contract struck up with he great ones the beast scourge seems to predate the curse on the hunters as evidenced by what happened to the pthumerians in loran so what exactly is the curse mentioned in the dlc the hunter nightmare itself which i am inclined to believe what are the pc true connection to cainhurst and the vilebloods and the vileblood connection to yharnam i could go on and on yes i have read a lot of theory and seen plenty of lore videos but there are still wide gaps that are left to be filled with interpretations and i am still not satisfied with so many of the ideas offered up d,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,yes lots of questions still remain even though lots of theories and ideas have been proposed but even these theories lean on a lot of speculation and uncertainties the timeline is still quite blurred among many other questions and curiousities ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,positioning is everything you have to stay closer to avoid those massive spin whirls which ususally one shot toons here a video of my onebro undead giant fight it that quickstep into his back left side to bait out his turn and swing which is easy to avoid then i think i finish him off with range attacks once he pretty low https m youtube com watch v o1bglshb p8,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,maybe it is because we seem to be a hybrid of byrgynwyrth and healin church methods with insight alone wilem seemed to turn fungoidal and useless in his chair with his kin looking tentacled with blood alone men turn into beasts but being moom scented using blood and insight seems to be the one thing that differentiates the pc hunter from everyone else and this we retain our sanity with enough insight we can even resist being the mp thrall ,2,bloodborne
Murdervermin,for sure ,2,bloodborne
Murdervermin,fine with me as i said i will take a sequel or offshoot d,2,bloodborne
Murdervermin,yeah i always thought from could do something amazing with sci fi horror and a futuristic and alien setting i mean i would love to see something like dead space done by from a man can dream also i love bloodborne and the story i would love to see a sequel or offshoot though i doubt it will happen ,3,bloodborne
Murdervermin,600 in storage most items you could need or want to farm go up to 600 other items like fire paper like fire resin can have a max of 99 in storage ,3,bloodborne
Murdervermin,yeah that why i said sp ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,das3 took cues from bb in terms of faster combat but it was nowhere near as solid as bb imo because bb rewards aggressive gameplay far more with the regain mechanic you take damage but you can rally some or all of it back by hitting enemies before the damage you took turns from orange to black on your health bar for bb combat become accustomed to fighting more aggressively playing defensively typically just punishes you with hard hitting long ranged attacks or obnoxious grab attacks parry bakstab is different too you parry with your gun and backstab by hitting enemies in the back with a charged attack following up with a visceral attack and there is no respeccing so make your build wisely for a first build id suggest str skill dex or a quality build arcane builds are awesome and powerful but slow and convoluted if you do not know where to find the right equipment and how to best utilize it there is no equipment load armor is more or less situational so you lose less defense going fashion souls in bb gotta admit i am jealous would love to be new on bb again as much as i love das bb is my favorite in terms of atmosphere story and gameplay coming together also the dlc is fantastic as usual for from soft ,13,bloodborne

Murdervermin,no kiddin huh bloodborne 2 please ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,funny i tend to think the same thing if there could only be one i would pick the dark souls series but i wound up loving bloodborne more than dark souls i mean gothic horror to cosmic horror shit i am in love the atmosphere the story i am just sad that there is not more ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,naw 15 arc for beast roar 18 arc for augur of ebriatis sp ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,cruel fate winds up being the best starting class for a 50 prime stat 25 secondary stat build if you go with the 15 arcane for use of the lowest req hunter tools you are already prime for a str build which could be something like 50 vigor 20 endurance 50 str 25 skill base blood tinge 15 arcane and i think this leaves you with a few more points you could put in endurance or bring arc up to 18 for a certain arcane tool that you can parry with while 2 handing a transformed str weapon ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,thanks for leaving this up i was just introduced to this sub today and i love this sort of thing this dungeon sounds horrifying ,1,tombprospectors
Murdervermin,that the only time he has ever killed me with a call beyond like i said i hope the one reborn and him are dead because it still an annoying fight but i cannot remember i am going to check tonight when i get home ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,awesome find thank you 112 tomb prospectors make that 113 ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yeah rom sucked ass i beat him eventually though i am scared to go back and see where my 4bro is parked i think he at mhergo wet nurse but killing the one reborn and micolash might just be wishful thinking on my behalf ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,the first half of the game and the first few chalices are honestly pretty damn easy as bl4 if you have played enough of the game to be well versed in the enemies moves it definitely ramps up in difficulty later on and plenty of fights suck ass but it is quite a thrill and if i can do it then so can others maybe behold my shadows of yharnam 1bro fight no bone blades https m youtube com watch v 0zjddscibkc see how i derp through that most elegantly easy right pffft i was asking for it so those assholes deserved to die behold another annoying bastard the undead giant https m youtube com watch v o1bglshb p8 see how i run from him a lot made me shit my pants and he killed me so many times on that second half of the fight through various one shot attacks either way utilize items as much as you can they make a much larger difference than on a non 4bro run i find playing defensively gets me killed as the game is meant to be played offensively however as a 4bro you cannot tank many or any hits for much of the game so your margin of error becomes pretty low to non existent i have not played my 4bro in a long time i have a few other boss fights recorded but not uploaded and i think he parked at i want to say mhergo wet nurse but that might be wishful thinking i cant even remember if i killed micolash or the one reborn but i hope i did i will see about recording some more videos in the unknown future and uploading them so people can feel better about themselves ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,oh yeaaaah shaman bone blades would have made shadows fight so much easier d,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,thank you i will give this a go tonight ,2,bloodborne
Murdervermin,the essay supernatural horror in literature by lovecraft is a must if you still have not read it in it he discusses many books and stories that have been integral in the birth and evolution of the genre many of which are worth reading many of which have been replicated or outright ripped off time and time again since their creation decades and decades ago ,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,shit were not we just talking on the das sub mind helping a returning hunter out i just made a post here asking for new hard and weird chalice glyphs if ya have any mind sharing d,1,bloodborne
Murdervermin,i still love them but i know i am in the minority with the rest of the sadists i mean after you have beaten the main game enough and aside pvp it not like there is much else to do so why not run some ridiculous gauntlets d,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,naw the essence of the souls games create the utimate fashion i mean build then drink deeply of the victory of elation after numerous deaths to bullshit i mean challenging mob layout and level design ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,i love them too it was never about farming the junk there just the elation and frustration of victory after numerous deaths and what have the souls games been about if anything else aside fashion d,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,plenty of us sadists loved the chalices but it was never about grinding out the crappy rewards but i understand people complaints with them i think a few tweaks to the system and the tile sets and mobs and bosses would have gone such a long way ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,reminds me of the isz chalice with 4 or 5 brain suckers and 3 or 4 prowling werewolves all in the same room iirc i could never lure just 1 enemy out there anyhow never with a throwing knife they all get mad ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yeah i did not log many hours on multiple builds in te chalices just for the crappy rewards i liked the challenging nature of the gauntlets because aside pvp and i hate the summon system in bb what else is there to do with your builds once you clear the main game a few times to me it was a welcome variation of the game play however limited and annoying it was at times ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yeah i remember hoping the bb dlc would add more bosses and enemies to the chalice dungeons but the only thing it added that i ever found was a hunter who carries the fist if gratia all this being said i realize how much i miss playing bb so i know what i will be doing this weekend d,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yeah i think people just misunderstood what people were saying they saw experiences ,1,darksouls3
Murdervermin,bah you guys are missing the point us sadists have it figured out it wasnt about the crappy rewards it was about dying and dying and dying to ridiculously hard dungeons with ridiculous layouts and mob placement p,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,big chalice runner here i have ran all the dungeons pro ported to be boss rushes and found nothing out of the ordinary i also ran every hardest weirdest dungeons i found on random websites and the reddit threads that would crop up from time to time and i never once encountered a boss rush as it is described in our mythology what the name conjures up is entering a room or a boss fog hate and bosses spawning back to back or room after room of bosses but i think all that was just a misunderstanding of a dubbing of the name the most i or others ie talked about it have found are multiple boss mobs in a dungeon layer in relative close proximity meaning that by the time you clear that layer you have killed 3 5 boss mobs i think the rest of the ideas surrounding or are just misunderstanding ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,yep i know lots of people hated the chalices for some fair reasons i might add but i came to love them it was awesome to make various builds then take them through the gauntlets of the chalices f r c for the rage i mean win shit now i know what i am gonna play when i have time later tonight bb ,2,darksouls3
Murdervermin,shit and i was gonna go as a sexy small pox blanket indian ,2,TumblrInAction
Murdervermin,they have awesome pb sandwiches in prison ,1,TumblrInAction
Murdervermin,yes it is when i cut off your skin and dance around in it like the mayans then it definitely is a costume d,1,TumblrInAction
Murdervermin,hahahaha go in there and tell her she ai not real next they are gonna say my inner indian whose dying from a small pox blanket is not real either so oppressed ,1,TumblrInAction
Murdervermin,i really wish asian women would stop fetishizing white men it so horrible that successful white men are so oppressed by cute little asian girls ,2,TumblrInAction
Murdervermin,sorry that women suck at negotiating standing on their own two feet without someone there to coddle and hold them up and sorry that women are terrible at competing and working with men in our whole monkey dominance hierarchy thing and i do not think that 24 7 bitchsplaining and the cunteruption of everything from public speakers to free speach is the answer ,1,TumblrInAction
Murdervermin,ah thanks for the info ,1,project1999
Murdervermin,chardok ae is dead what happened ,1,project1999
Murdervermin,solo or duo the hill giants in rm sure it often crowded but you can make good exp and money there especially when you luck out and the place isnt too crowded i stayed there trough 44 then went over to the specters in feerot at 44 as well as playing in cs and a few other party spots for solo and small group play i specialized in conjuration and chain summoned fire pets through all of it for max exp and minimum downtime ,1,project1999
Murdervermin,yeah i think this is what is frustrating players as the game does not do a good job of explaining classes an their counters and it takes some time to learn how to counter classes properly especially the ones you are weak against but this is why back up and a good squad and team are important to keep team members from being picked off especially since a lot of players seem confused how melee works ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,in your experience in the case you mentioned do you just shoot from the hip or do you take the time to aim i have not messed with standard bolsters in a while so i am wondering what works best ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,what is your build do you have armor unlocked and toughness or hp war gear if he had a good survivability build no way you could have won that also gotta aim for head and torso this game does a terrible job explaining classes counters and the best way to deal with each class in that case you mentioned i prolly would have run as tried sneaking back around to kill the heavy unless i was melee because melees counter heavy best ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,what is your build do you have armor unlocked and toughness or hp war gear if he had a good survivability build no way you could have won that also gotta aim for head and torso ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,yeah learning the little but of nuance there is and class counters have increased my enjoyment of ec but they have not ironed out as many bugs as they should for it to be where it at nor have they ironed out or relatively balanced the classes and abilities of each and i get it that it not supposed to be balanced to the point that all classes and races are equal but i think they could have implemented better tutorials tool tips and i information especially for new players so they can learn the complexities better and reduce their frustration in game because my initial impression was that things were way off balance as we see posted here on the daily but i do not think the balance is as horrible as everyone says and a good squad and team and composition make all races and matches beatable ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,yup the melee cluster fucks are hit and miss when i play melee because it so chaotic but most of my kills come from strategic attacks and sneak attacks and catching the classes i know are weak to me other melees are hit and miss too since some know the system well and others have no idea there even is a system ,2,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,how is over watch i wanted ec to be great and while it fun and i love the 40k universe the game just is not that great ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,yeah i was late catching up on the game development and it a bummer that they have up on the persistent mmo world and it worse that they keep trying to say it is that ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,yup this is why i almost never engage shield sms none of my builds are really built to counter them especially at close range and they are the toughest nuts to crack for me at least but occasionally i get lucky but my best bet is knowing when to run and team mates ,3,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,spam attacks are easy to counter you just have to d bash parry them best bet is to roll backwards from melee guy he will typically use a light attack to lunge at you but before he connects you have already initiated your d bash which stuns him and you use that time to unload your gun in his face rinse repeat you cannot spazz out even though that the reaction ah op melee i am gunna die you have to pay attention to what attacks they are using and counter in accord an remember melee are strong counters to many other gun classes but once you get those down you should not die to melee as much d,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,i think we need to join a guild d,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,i guess we got all the good players yesterday sure we lost a few rounds but we also pulled off some awesome defenses and assaults for some really intense matches did really good overall ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,you can counter it the small nuances you do not know getting you killed most likely there are three attacks light attack charge attack and d bash parrying blow if you and your foe both light attack you will clang and if you keep clanging your weapon will lose durability until your weapon stops working effectively if someone is spamming light attack you use parry d bash to stun them and then follow with light attacks yourself or if you are a gunner roll dodge back and open fire and kite them in this manner if youre a heavy gunner you will need to be damn quick or make sure you have support if you are melee v melee it goes like this you d bash light attacks and use light attacks when your d bash stuns them if you charge your strong attack while they are stunned they will likely be able to counter or roll away before you pull it off if they use charged strong attack use light attack to interrupt them but be quick or their weapon will smash through your light attack determined by the force of the weapon attacking do not just spam light attack or they will stun you sometimes it hard to tell what is going on around you in a total cluster fuck but you are best bet as melee is to always get the jump on your prey with a charged attack to the back this almost always guarantees a kill in a follow up swing or two if you just run in spamming light attack you are never gonna last long and those who utilize the system will always beat you and there are plenty of good players in this game b i am not 100 clear on the rest but it something like the counter to using melee weapons on charged heavy attacks relates to the power force of the weapon ie if you try light attacking with your combat knife while someone is charging up with their power fist or power maul you are gonna get hurt conversely if you have the power fist or maul or axe then you know you can bust through a smaller melee weapon provided you pull the swing off to release the force of the weapon ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,if you are carrying light weapons you have to kite them and this can be hard to pull off on pro players roll back and open fire typically they will light attack towards you to cover ground be proactive and initiate a defnsive bash to stun them the d bash is how you counter light attacks light quick attacks counter heavy attacks but it depends on the force of the weapon they are using and open fire as you back off rinse and repeat try to make sure you have support and know that if you are a heavy gunner than you are especially vulnerable to melee classes they are your weakness if i am lucky on a heavy i can stay alive long enough for team mates to help me before melee beats me since i have no solid counters aside awareness and range to gun them down considering the large guns take forever to open fire after being interrupted etc ,-2,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,melee is not so bad once you get the hang of it its not so much broken but it a clunky game of rock v paper v scissors especially when you inevitably wind up in big melee cluster fucks where you are just as likely to shoot and kill or melee and interfere with your own team mates as the enemy melees bolsters are pretty damn weak but the heavier weapons are badass and much more useful and fun to use and you have to use restraint or you will be that asshole always team killing your own dudes do not shoot into the melee unless you have a perfect shot or are a damn good aim and most important is being aware of your class counters and making sure you have back up because any decent melee will be able to kill a heavy who does not have support or distance to shoot etc all that being said yes melee is pretty powerful compared to guns especially when those with guns have to be careful during the cluster fucks and melee is very dangerous in the hands of really good players but this can be compensated for by working as a team sticking with your squad using vantage points to mow down melees and avoiding those assholes with the shields that can deflect plasma and explosions ,3,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,so it not just me then parry seems to slow down the one who uses it as much as the one who is stunned by it in my experience this means that it is essentially just a pause in the melee spam fest as for rolling rolling does not seem to matter when i or whoever else is melee is right on top of you lunge swinging as soon as the roll is finished point is melee combat needs to be more nuanced it seems so hit and miss yet very predictable ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,is d bash the same as parry listed in the controls thanks i ask because i like melee but it seems like most of the time it is a click fest and parrying blow seems to be hit or miss when either i or my opponent uses it as there seems to be quite a delay in using it that is i use parry and by the time i can swing my weapon again so can they am i missing out on some nuance or limitation ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,what is the trick with melee say the difference between the axe and sword in a fight because it seems like it all a spam fest to see who clicks rmb fastest whether i am playing a scorpion or csm with an axe it just seems like a click fest with little nuance and the parrying blow seems to be hit or miss since it takes longer to pull it off which just gives the opposing rmb clicker time to wail on you again i do not know the particulars but it just seems that not clicking rmb as fast as possible is a death sentence ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,yeah i would say the biggest learning curve has been the counter classes as i said above none of the classes i have been focusing on are good counters hence i do not bother with the shields if i can help it or if there is a wad of team mates to help out ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,cool thanks is the shard of iron very far into the advancement tree ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,yeah someone just told me orks are indeed in game and i have heard many fun things about them i just have yet to see any ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,i have been playing for weeks now and have never been matched against orks so i cannot speak on that but the lsm shield troops are tough as shit ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,i have tried that before out of desperation but i dont think ive ever pulled it off i think avoidance winds up being the best strategy for not dying to them ,2,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,hehe shields make me salty period i have found no consistent it counter to them other than getting a serious drop on them running from them or them dying in a large enough zerg the classes loadouts i like to play just seem to fail utterly against them and my question is what is their actual counter ,3,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,damn i loved playing the waves v orks on the ultramarine games hopefully they work something out there thanks or the info ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,gotcha thanks ,2,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,what is that green standard on your traitor assault and what is mon and shard of iron thanks in advance for your replies i enjoy playing chaos and have been trying to learn more about their items abilities etc ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,how did you get into lair pre made groups i have wanted to play lair but there are never enough players qued and waves with orks was fun as hell on the ultramarine game ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,people keep saying eldar are op but i have played a lot with them and aside often starting fights with far less players than the other faction they seem to be countered quite easily usually with lsm and csm teams comprised of half plasma played a bunch of matches last night and even when we had descent teams who were working together we still lost more than we won though a few of the matches were really close hectic fun battles so i cannot complain about that ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,i have played a lot of matches as eldar and csm and i have not faced up against orks once any idea why i played a bit in alpha and i have been playing a lot the last few weeks ,1,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,yeah i have been using battle now because it is the only option to play the game what i asked is did they give up on larger world maps or is it in the works for some later date ,2,Eternalcrusade
Murdervermin,that is finally what they are doing in this xpac the quests have rewards worth completing plus they need to be completed to unlock world quests so there is actually a decent reason to continue exploring and questing that hopefully winds up a bit less tedious and grindy ,3,wow
Murdervermin,yup in this regard it is much more like gw2 with scaling and every thing granting experience and these were a few things gw2 did right d,1,wow
Murdervermin,she kicked you out like you were some naughty dog wtf as your attorney i advise you to move back into the house and kick her ass out ,1,wow
Murdervermin,you mean the whole main story chain for that zone thanks ,1,wow
Murdervermin,no its not too much to ask in the slightest you are a grown man ffs do you need aome sort of post childhood mommy to direct your life and judge you for it no fuck no you dont here is something to learn early something a lot of men remain forever blind to dont let your gf control and manipulate you and turn your time and energy away from your own goals hobbies and ideas because she will just divert it towards what she wants and now you are one more unhappy sap in a shitty relationship resenting and regretting your life your partner and your decisions and responsibility in it point is if someone cannot accept you and what you choose and like as you are then they are likely controlling manipulative bastards who only know very conditional love and do you really want to be with someone like that point is most people are like that and my source watching the endless parade of shitty relationships marriages and horrible advice on these subjects both irl and on reddit and the conveyor belt of dysfunction and divorce that society is wish you the best man ,1,wow
Murdervermin,yup so many concern trolls quite the joke i mean who wants to take time off work or indulge in their favorite hobbies and games and personal objectives it not like we already spend vast portions of our life stuck doing things we do not necessarily care to do so why would we want to take time to do what we actually want to do be responsible be good little peons ,1,wow
Murdervermin,lol so much concern trolling here but fuck yeah op i have no doubt that if people are fortunate enough to live to an old age and look back on life aside personal goals and more personal work i seriously doubt any of us will be regretting working less or taking a few days off from school or work especially since most of us are just pawns in the greater systems and infrastructure of the world but yet so much hugs and concern about being irresponsible as a skeptical realistic pragmatist it is quite the joke d,1,wow
Murdervermin,heya back in wrath my main was an unholy dk until i fell in love with frost and have been maiming a frost dk ever since but now frost feels so limited and gutted i started new toons on alliance to play with some friends and i was wondering if ya could fill me in on what makes unholy good dps and more fun at max level so far i do not like what they changed on diseases and runes but i will give it another go thanks ,1,wow
Murdervermin,i fucking hate the general changes to dks runes etc and the changes to frost are even worse as i actually enjoyed the reactive and proactive style of frost dks going back to wrath now frost dks are way behind unholy and probably most other melee classes apparently the gutted my other favorite too destro lock so now i am a havoc dh ,1,wow
Murdervermin,i hate the changes they made to my favorite dps builds since wrath destro lock and frost dk so now i am mainig a dh which feels close enough to a dual wieldig dk but much better since they gutted my preferred classes i would play an unholy dk but i do not like the chanes to the runes and abilities and to me it just seems like they streamlined some of the classes and builds into oblivion ,1,wow
Murdervermin,do you guys need a mage by chance ,1,project1999
Murdervermin,not sure how effectively you can do it at your current level but at 29 you could kill giant skellies in rathe mountains they drop a few gold to a few pp each on top of bone chips you can stack and sell at 24 28 you would probably be better off duoing in rm ,1,project1999
Murdervermin,as others have said while the grind can be slow and daunting at first eventually an iksar necro will be easily able to farm experience gear and plat in a group or solo at earlier levels i would definitely suggest grouping or duoing because even soloing on my twinked iksar alt necro spells were are fairly mana intensive especially before you get the better lich spells mana regen at higher levels and eventually mana cost becomes less of an issue even so iksar necros are still a great and independent class i will try catchin ya online sometime and if we are close or in the same zone i will gladly throw some pp your way to help with spells and other odds and ends again plat becomes easy to farm by mid to higher levels hope ya have fun the server is great if you just wanna enjoy some classic eq gameplay d,1,project1999
