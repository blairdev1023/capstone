thefanciestcat,both parties have proposed tax reform with lower corporate tax rates in fact the current rate being pushed by republicans was pushed by democrats under obama a few years ago and fought by these same republicans the main difference being that democrats sought to raise revenue by broadening the base closing loopholes eliminating deductions and raising effective rates for some while also lowering marginal rates the logic being that big companies pay a little more and small ones a little less and more money comes into the treasury whereas the gop plans always cut tax revenue in unsustainable ways and are about cuts for those generating the most revenue regardless that highest corporate tax rate thing comes from marginal tax rates effective rates are lower how much are american corporations being hurt in the global market by the us having these higher marginal rates it unclear but given the low effective rates can be it probably not having much of an effect at all everyone in business understands that there are ways around those higher rates especially big business ,25,politics
