air_gopher,well then in that case everything is a human right is not it like guns drugs prostitutes nuclear fuel rods etc i mean what defines the internet as a human right vs say heroin if i was addicted to it i can agree with you that no government should be able to block you from purchasing an internet connection from a private company or seller same goes for food and water ,1,technology
air_gopher,the u n can define what is and is not a right all they want to but it does not make it so if you are stranded on a desert island do you still have the right to an internet connection you cannot call something a human right that has to be provided to you by other people either through force or payement that absurd what if nobody wanted to physically work on providing the infrastructure to your home would you have the government force them to do so ,1,technology
air_gopher, again its a human right god no it absolutely is not a human right human rights are not things that you are required to pay for or someone else has to give to you if you buy a house way up on top of a mountain where there is no infrastructure do you still have the right to the internet no you do not so it not a basic human right what are you smoking ,0,technology
air_gopher,it not that we do not care about mass shootings we have a problem with the democratic party proposed solutions to them you keep talking about weapons of war but an ar15 is not a weapon of war name one single military anywhere in the world that arms its soldiers with an ar15 and if they are weapons of war then why the fuck do our police have them when creating policy logic is what matters not emotion the fact is ar platform rifles are the most popular rifles sold in the us there are millions and millions of them out there yet overall they account for less than 1 of overall firearms related crime yet somehow you people seem to think banning them will solve something there is absolutely zero logic to that furthermore we already had an assault weapons ban from 94 to 2004 and it did absolutely jack shit yet still you people want to ban them again i mean what the fuck you need to educate yourself on firearms before you form an opinion on how to regulate a constitutional right and preferably before you start further spreading fear uncertainty and doubt and other bullshit start by going here http www assaultweapon info and another thing there is no gunshow loophole first of all gun shows generally do not allow private sales to occur on premisis and if two residents of the same state want to transfer a firearm they do not need to do a nics check and that was specifically agreed to when the laws were written it is not a loophole jesus today compromise is tomorrow loophole what is it with you people go educate yourself on these topics and quit spreading around bullshit ,1,Libertarian

air_gopher,i will be struggling with this one for the next seven days,2,westworld
air_gopher,have you ever lied to us ,8,westworld
air_gopher,earlier during that scene bernard mentions the tech being older but still able to create a modern host in a couple of days which supports your theory that it could be an elsie replacement ,3,westworld
air_gopher,not to mention the fact that he been banging her for a while recording all kinds of things ,8,westworld
air_gopher,and he was silently giving him instructions as to what to do next ,19,westworld
air_gopher,nnnnno ,1,westworld
air_gopher,well what if the board is programmed to send in fresh humans every once in a while to check up on him would give him an opportunity to replace more and more people in the real world that do his bidding ,2,westworld
air_gopher,hmm i guess my meaning for a was some kind of mechanical implant he has or something i do not know,7,westworld
air_gopher,interesting had not thought of that aspect maybe that what leads to his unraveling later ,3,westworld
air_gopher,i am subscribing to the theory that bernard is the replacement for arnold and that why he could not see himself in that photograph that ford showed him in that earlier episode it showed young ford standing next to a man that we found out is actually ford dad dad replacement yet there ample room on the right hand side of the photo for another person ,6,westworld
air_gopher,heh holy shit i wonder if bernard was the one who grabbed her at the end of last episode then ford planted the whole vacation thing and with his older equipment as bernard said takes a few more days to create a host than the ones they have in the mesa ,56,westworld
air_gopher,i really really hope this is not the end of clementine character arc she such an amazing actress ,9,westworld
air_gopher,i did not see any finger twitching but watch closely his subtle eye contact with bernard during that whole scene particularly toward the end i really wonder if a he has a mind control link with the hosts and or b ford is also a host that can communicate with them over their network ,22,westworld
air_gopher,that all makes perfect sense now but why would he just have that photo sitting on his desk knowing other westworld staff might come in to talk about something would not they see the photo and wonder something about it who that guy in the center etc or maybe he does not allow anyone but bernard into his private office i do not know ,9,westworld
air_gopher,yeah no way ford would allow they system to even register him at all if he was is a host he built this whole thing every blade of grass ,15,westworld
air_gopher,for a minute there i was wondering if he had already replaced the entire board itself that what i would do ,2,westworld
air_gopher,yep and even though she initiated the sexual relationship with bernard ford engineered it all along the whole time they were bumping uglies bernard was mapping the shit out of her and giving the data back to ford so that he could make a perfect replica i love this fucking show ,1,westworld

air_gopher,yes local and state governments the federal government on the other hand governs the states the president presides over the states not the people this is why we have an electoral college instead of a popular vote similarly prior to the 17th amendment to the us constitution senators were picked by state legislatures not the people representatives represented the people and senators represented the states all of these things were put into place to keep the tyranny of the masses from breaking the federal government and these failsafes have been under attack since the passage of the 17th next to go will be the ec and once that done san francisco la new york chicago and other huge cities will control how the people in eastern montana are governed even though most of the big cities have zero idea what life is like in agricultural rural usa ,1,politics

air_gopher,my biggest issue with this entire theory is this would not all the hosts in the older timeline be clunky and mechanical and obviously robots like the buffalo bill one that ford was having a drink with in ep 1 it was quite obviously older tech jerky motions making whirring sounds when it moved its arms and such they do say that dolores was the first host but they also explain away her modern body by saying she been upgraded so many times she basically brand new but 30 years ago they did not have the current technology and all those hosts would be much more obvious but in all your alleged older timeline scenes the hosts are still indistinguishable from guests ,1,westworld

air_gopher, no other product that you buy requires a comparable level of licensing titling insuring etc that has nothing to do with any of this all of those things can be performed by the consumer they do not require a dealership i am still wondering why we need these regulations for new automobiles but we do not for any other product by forcing the franchise system you guaranteeing the consumer price competition on initial sales parts and service no you are not you are only guaranteeing an overall price increase manufacturers already have to compete with one another sure dealerships have to compete with each other now but at the end of the day the consumer loses because they still have to pay for the dealership outrageous overhead where the manufacturer could do it cheaper furthermore most dealerships only sell from one manufacturer or another so you are still selecting based on brand it not like all dealerships sell all makes and models of cars this is not something that should be summarily discarded yes it should there is absolutely no valid logical reason to have these regulations on the books it crony capitalism plain and simple ,1,technology
air_gopher,it not removing any competition the old dealerships are more than welcome to try to stay in business if they cannot then tough shit there is still going to be competition between the car manufacturers which is the way it should be the entire premise for this type of law was flawed to begin with bad businesses and people who make bad business decisions pay the price that how life works when you open a business you assume a certain amount of risk in the case of early dealerships one of those risks was that the car company itself might someday compete not hard to foresee that one coming why do we not need these regulations for any other product ,1,technology
air_gopher,at the end of the day it is the manufacturers that are competing with each other even now sure they might try to pocket the extra profit after the dealers go bye bye but that wo not last long when one of the manufacturers realizes they can outsell everyone else by not pocketing it then all of them will drop the extra cash and prices will all go down just like in any other market ,1,technology

air_gopher,battleye started with the following automatic console message several days ago important effective immediately battleye is no longer providing protection for servers using outdated non steam versions of the game we are sorry but this is due to gamespy suddenly marking all cd keys as valid even if they are fake generated this basically means that anyone who has a banned cd key can continue to use it hackers can make up a cd key out of thin air and join your server and do whatever they want without worrying about getting banned unless you update your server now most of my regular players are back and i have been pointing them to dayz launcher http www dayzlauncher com to use instead of broken dzc or the in game browser ,10,dayz

air_gopher,i do not know if it actually updates your a2oa exe some people are even having issues with that part it definitely shows steam servers now it just launches them wrong some of the guys in the forums were saying it can take several hours before steam reports your server correctly mine has been updating with steam for 6 hours now and dzc still launches arma wrong for it i have my server title shortened with the a2oa version visible but nope dzc still broken all the while dzl is reporting and working just fine it very frustrating i put off updating to this version precisely because we knew dzc was going to get updated to work with steam and i did not want to lose my regulars now i have updated and have an empty server this entire switchover to steam could not have been handled more poorly ,1,DayZmod
air_gopher,the problem with the older 112555 version is that battleye does not support it anymore and hackers are already running rampant on those servers be reports all cd keys as valid on the old 112555 versions so all the assholes with banned guids and fake cd keys can join your server and break things ,1,DayZmod
air_gopher,as i stated in an earlier reply dayz commander does not properly report the mod the server is running on the latest a2oa patch so it launches arma incorrectly for these this is the problem op is most likely having and unless dotjosh fixes it we are back to square one i would encourage people to switch over to dayz launcher http www dayzlauncher com and forget about commander ,1,DayZmod
air_gopher, connection problems from here on out will most likely be not true the newer version of dayz commander is extremely buggy and by most reports does not work at all for newly upgraded servers my server sometimes does not show up on it and when it does commander lists it as a normal dayz server instead of the epoch server it is when a user double clicks to launch it tries to launch connect regular dayz dayz launcher is the future the developers of commander apparently do not give a shit anymore ,2,DayZmod

air_gopher, without regulation these entities will ride roughshod over us have you ever heard the phrase do not bite the hand that feeds you corporations can only do so much as long as we as consumers are still willing to purchase their services and products they make their money because of us not in spite of us this is where i just do not understand reddit mentality of corporations are all out to fuck us people can mobilize and organize a massive sit in on wall street to get a point across but god forbid they try to organize an old fashioned boycott and maybe go without their fast internet connection for a few months i never said anything about pollution and i think we can all agree that it is wrong and should be illegal to pollute your neighbor drinking water and air that a matter of enforcing property rights laws now if you want to sell your soul to the corporations that fine at least i can choose to sell my soul to the corporations or not i would rather have that choice than have government you know the biggest monopoly of them all able to force me to sell my soul to a corporations like the healthcare mandate ,3,blog
air_gopher, we depend on government to rein them in speak for yourself more often than not the government is in bed with these very same corporations making back room deals and forcing us as consumers to do business with them in ways we may not choose to i would rather take my chances and leave government out of it tyvm the minute you add government power to the equation the corporations really have us by the balls the banks were in bed with the government the entire time glass steagall or no they knew their bullshit loans were government guaranteed and they knew they would all get bailed out of things went south there was absolutely zero risk because they had the government in their back pocket the whole time ,5,blog
air_gopher,i suppose we are talking about different types of rights http en wikipedia org wiki natural and legal rights i cannot disagree with anything you have stated all i can say is it does not make much sense to call something a right if it requires removing a different right from someone else you cannot have a right to healthcare without removing a doctors choice whether or not to provide it just like you cannot have rights to basic housing and food without requiring society to provide it ,1,news

air_gopher,they may be more inhumane but they are far less likely to kill an innocent bystander and again in war the objective is not quite the same as for self defense hollowpoint rounds are for stopping the threat in war the objective is to take out of action and there is a big difference between the two in a combat scenario you can throw your hands up and surrender but that wo not necessarily work when some thug is intent on doing you bodily harm in your home ,1,todayilearned
air_gopher,why hollow points are less useful in warfare the objective in war is to take the enemy out of action full metal jacket rounds achieve this objective and often times wound more than one enemy a wounded enemy is out of action for every wounded enemy one or more other enemies have to administer aid and thus the enemy resources are further strained ,2,todayilearned

air_gopher,after reading through the post history of u el guapo malo it clear he either a dedicated troll or so full of frothing at the mouth hatred for anything conservative that he blind to any kind of reasoning that does not fuel his own anger yesterday i argued for choice in giving charity in this same thread and he frothingly told me i am a selfish twat ,1,explainlikeimfive
air_gopher,yep agreed most people want the government in control of it all right now all i can do is argue my point of view and as far as church vs government i am with you as far as not liking churches having their hands in everyone pie but at least i get a choice to not give to churches whereas if it government i have no choice and right now the government gives tax money to faith based programs to help those in need and i would rather that money go somewhere else ,1,explainlikeimfive
air_gopher,at least with private charities we can choose who gets our money and as a result there is more incentive to be efficient either way it sucks that there are people in need and i do what i can to help as i would hope most do but forcing other people to do what you think is right is just as wrong as doing nothing at all not sure if that made any sense ,0,explainlikeimfive
air_gopher,if the majority are willing to give on their own then why again do they need the middle man why do they need to use force to get everyone to participate why cannot the majority be free to give to their choice of charity rather than have a giant inefficient bureaucracy dictate for them ,1,explainlikeimfive
air_gopher, because if we did not there would be a critical lack of help for the poor and homeless see how that works i do not agree with that i think most human beings are little more decent and giving than that if we cut government spending on social welfare yeah the charities would have to step it up a notch and try to draw more awareness and attention to their cause but it can be done right now with government providing so much they do not have to try and that how you get the numbers quoted in your links you still did not answer my first question why do you think it ok to make them do it especially if as you seem to think the vast majority are not willing to give on their own ,0,explainlikeimfive
air_gopher,i think a lot of them started due to big promises by government officials such as the roosevelts particularly fdr during the great depression promises which arguably did nothing to help the situation in the long run private charities can handle the burden especially in today world of information sharing where it a lot easier to spread awareness and raise money for a cause ,0,explainlikeimfive

air_gopher,if the vast majority of people did not want to help the poor and homeless and i am not agreeing that the case then why do you think it ok to make them do it if the majority do want to help the less fortunate then why do they need government programs to do it why cannot people be free to give to the charities that matter to them ,-1,explainlikeimfive

air_gopher,if you reread what i wrote my point was that it is already illegal to fire a weapon in a crowded theater without a life death reason as well i think we are on the same page here i wholeheartedly agree with what you just wrote regarding free speech edit my point being banning weapons or certain kinds of weapons would be like banning words just because they might be misused ,2,Libertarian
air_gopher,we have laws limiting where and when you can fire a weapon as well a notable one being it is illegal to randomly fire a weapon in a crowded theater ,1,Libertarian
air_gopher,yes and it is already illegal to fire a gun in a crowded theater unless there is a valid threat or reason to do so as gbcue said current and proposed restrictions on the 2nd are like trying to pass a restriction on the 1st by taping people mouths shut so they do not have the possibility of yelling fire in a crowded theater or completely banning the word fire ,3,news

air_gopher,my point was that a company who tries to maximize profit not just make enough to pay for labor and administrative costs has more incentive to provide cheaper and better services ,1,boulder
air_gopher, xcel has the right to be the only power distributor in the area since i do not quite understand how the energy industry works you will have to explain that to me why cannot other companies distribute in this area who is stopping them they can buy power from whomever they want xcel included xcel can also buy energy from other providers if it cheaper than providing their own ,1,boulder
air_gopher,why is not for profit better if they are not trying to generate a profit then what is their motivation to make the service better or more efficient i get that people think there is no way anyone can compete with xcel but that really is not true if another company has the ability to provide the same service cheaper to us and cheaper to themselves they will go for it that just good business when the city runs it there will never be that option having a community run utility sounds like a great idea and it might work but it will never work as well as one owned by a private company who fears competition the reality is xcel business is energy and they are better at making decisions on how to run it than the voting masses they are accountable financially as opposed to a few elected officials who are afraid of losing their jobs the reality of a municipal utility is a bunch of beaurocrats making decisions that are not always in the interests of the population even though they are supposed to be take the intersection of jay and 199 for instance how long did it take them to finish that i work in denver and watched 2 privately owned multi story buildings go up from nothing in less than a year and the jay 199 intersection was still unfinished are these the assholes you want running and or directing your power utility ,1,boulder

air_gopher, but the rest of us end up being the ones that pay for your plan b what is forcing the rest of us to do that and how is that any more expensive ,1,Libertarian
air_gopher,the second article you linked to disagrees with much of what the first article claims the third article says the us is more expensive but that because it has more treatment alternatives that are newer and more expensive i cannot argue that drugs are cheaper in the us however if the us passed a law right now that said from now on no drugs will cost more than 1 cent to the consumer you can be certain the us would have the cheapest drugs on average than any other country that does not mean that particular regulation is helping ,0,Astronomy
air_gopher,the only way they can control the competition is by manipulation of the market by buying off government and getting them to regulate in their favor the playing field is unfair precisely because of this want to level the playing field get rid of the bought and paid for government bureaucracies insurance companies do not want to pay any more for drugs than you or i do again they are in this for profit and they cannot very well make a profit if they are spending it all they can and do negotiate prices with vendors and service providers as best they can just like you or i do ,0,Astronomy
air_gopher,if pharmaceutical companies could sell drugs at a cheaper rate to more people and still make the same profit they would that basic economics the reason they do not is most likely too many regulations prevent them from doing so drugs really are very expensive to research test manufacture and it not worth it to sell them any cheaper medical companies are not stupid it not like they do not want to make money by selling something that poorer people can afford they are a business after all ,-6,Astronomy

air_gopher,how magnanimous of him ,1,news
air_gopher, the top 100 richest americans is sitting on over 1 trillion dollars in wealth again they are not just sitting on it they have to keep their wealth somewhere and the safest place is in banks where their money is being used invested in the economy either directly by them or by the financial institutions holding their money it not a giant pile of gold bars in their living room we are all benefiting from their financial success in that regard not just the 1 like i said they provide the capital that individuals and small businesses need to borrow when you say things like they are just sitting on it you are vastly oversimplifying and skewing things to fit your argument and again you want more government involvement yet you admitted that the wealthy use this very same government to manipulate policy in their favor environmental policy is a whole other thing and i never once advocated that we let corporations run rampant with that ,1,economy
air_gopher, no body is asking anyone to take money from anyone what do you thing taxation is especially when you advocate taxing one class more than another what the wealthy need to do is stop hoarding all the gains it not like they are scrooge mcduck diving in big piles of gold in their giant vaults that not how it works they keep that money invested back in the economy which in turn creates more jobs people like you and i can get business loans to start new companies precisely because those wealthy people provide that capital investment they have been doing this by using their excessive wealth to buy our political system to rig the game in their favor and that is certainly a problem that what we call crony capitalism big business manipulating government into tilting the market economy in their favor and yet sure we are better off than people 100 years ago and how did we get there i can assure you that government played a huge role in that and we had heavily regulated markets back then and yet you seem to think that more government is the answer brilliant so let me get this straight big bad evil wealthy people stole their way up to the top by manipulating government into screwing over everyone else so you want to create even more government and give them more power ,0,economy
air_gopher,you say change the current economic system and capitalism is an outdated system what is your proposed solution then you cannot just create prosperity out of thin air jobs and prosperity come from producing goods and services and innovation these are things the government cannot do sure there is a huge gap between the wealthy and everyone else but we as a society are far better off than we were a hundred years ago or even a decade ago it sucks that there are people who are poor personally i believe in helping them out but i do not believe in taking your money by force and helping them out with that instead if we want to grow our economy and create jobs we need to produce more and innovate more not take more ,3,economy
air_gopher,so if the market does not dictate the wages then who does if labor is abundant and jobs are in decline what would the alternative be you cannot force companies to hire workers for non existent labor and mandating that they overcompensate employees is equally ludicrous in the real world when jobs are scarce in any particular field it time to start looking for a job in a different field that just reality ,13,economy
air_gopher,that really not how economics work first of all you assume that the upper class spend all their money on less things than the middle class on the contrary they do not keep their money stuffed in mattresses they keep it in bank accounts invested in the economy these investments help to spur innovation and create new companies and jobs now i would call that spreading the wealth really what you are saying is you want to take the money from the people that have it and give it to the people that do not that the essence of it right mainly because if you give an extra dollar to a poor person they are going to spend it not tuck it away in a savings account money tucked away in savings accounts is what drives investments and creates jobs if it were not for savings accounts there would be no money for business loans this is not about making a bigger blanket my point still stands robbing peter to pay paul is not doing anything in the long run to grow or otherwise change the economy for the better ,2,changemyview
air_gopher, giving lower income people more money will allow them to put more money into the economy so then why do not we just print up a few trillion dollars and give it to them where is this money coming from that we are going to just give to the lower class does not it come out of the economy to begin with that called the free market a free market is a free as in freedom market where employers and employees agree on pay freely setting a minimum wage or raising it artificially distorts the market and in the end does nothing but hurt the very people who you are trying to help as the saying goes you cannot lengthen a blanket by cutting a foot of the top and sewing it on to the bottom ,2,changemyview
air_gopher,so you are saying they are doomed to work minimum wage jobs their entire lives no way out therefore we must force their employers to pay them more than their job is worth raising minimum wage to some arbitrary value is not the answer why not raise it up to 50 hr or 100 hr who decides what a living wage is what if somebody wants to live in midtown manhattan and work a minimum wage job ,0,changemyview
air_gopher,so the people who actually entered into voluntary employment agreements with these companies do not know or do not care if they are paid crappy wages the employees are doing business with the companies too by working for them they also have a choice they can work somewhere else they are not slaves and they are not forced to work anywhere ,1,changemyview
air_gopher,i have read your comments and no it is not an outright lie ,0,changemyview

air_gopher,and then the new cost of the food would go up because the employer is paying their workers more this cycle would just go on and on until like phantompumpkin said we have 15 burgers not sure how that so hard to understand minimum wage hikes do nothing but increase the cost of goods and services starting with basic goods services so in effect you are hurting the very people you are trying to help ,-1,changemyview

air_gopher,the point has nothing to do with training teachers to be militia the point is teachers who want to obtain a ccw permit legally and carry a concealed weapon to work should be allowed to you seem to think that people who arm themselves all of a sudden have a higher probability to go crazy that is simply untrue people who go through the steps to obtain a ccw are probably the least likely to go nuts more guns is the only option in my mind the fact of the matter is criminals can and will get guns whether or not there is some type of ban and those who are responsible for your children every day should have the tools to protect them with lethal force if necessary ,1,Libertarian

air_gopher,i do not know what hurts me worse seeing these bigot lying hating assholes teaching their children to do the same or being ready to die to defend their right to do so being born into a very religious family it was hard enough for me to break out of the mold but my parents at least raised me with the option to choose for myself what to believe i feel guilty when i am around them because i no longer subscribe to their beliefs and it sucks bad family is a huge bond no matter where you come from these kids got a bad rap in life whether or not they find a way out just the stigma of being part of the phelps family will be an albatross i wish the kids good luck in finding a way out ,2,Documentaries
air_gopher,i was best man at my brother wedding this summer i rehearsed the hell out of the toast i was giving at one point during the speech as i was complementing the bride i was supposed to say she able to laugh at the small things in life and she does not take anything too seriously instead i forgot my lines and said something like she able to laugh at the small things in life which may come in handy later on everyone started laughing and i could not tell whether or not it was at me or with me or why not until later when somebody said great joke man even delivered it with a serious face ,161,AskReddit

air_gopher,low taxation taking the risk out of speculation taxes are certain no matter how much money you earn i would prefer the wealthy keep more of their money invested in the economy creating jobs rather than giving it to the government so it can be wasted on 2k toilet seats ,5,Economics

air_gopher,you are missing jawajoey point he said and according to libertarian ideology if a company does something disastrous like destroy the ocean they owe a big fucking debt to society that they sure as hell better pay that in itself should be reason enough for them to take better precautions with their rigs however it was not reason enough because they knew they would not have to pay for the damages due to this cap regulation hopefully people dump all of their bp stock and stop buying their products i would love to watch them go out of business ,10,politics
air_gopher,agreed bp and all the other companies involved in this screw up deserve to go out of business and lose everything for what they have done the fact that we even had a 75 million cap to begin with is ludicrous they should be voting to remove it altogether not up it a measly 10 billion ,2,politics

air_gopher,i agree the whole point of child porn laws is to protect children from abuse and potentially having the rest of their lives screwed up because of some pics floating around out there so here we are using the laws against them instead of to protect them sure the kid needs to be punished but register as a sex offender that will ruin the rest of his life how ironic ,2,offbeat

air_gopher,as long as the municipality keeps it a free choice not mandating anything then i agree ,2,technology
air_gopher,the difference is a municipally controlled tax based option is still controlled by government not the people consumers and the municipality can control the competition thereby giving them the advantage and not always in the best interests of the consumers edit the people being the government theoretically ,1,technology
air_gopher,so serious question what is keeping other competitors from trying to offer services in your area ,1,technology
air_gopher,yep keyword being make whereas the competition cannot do that if it is a truly free market ,1,technology
air_gopher,agreed i should have added a sarcasm to my comment ,1,technology
air_gopher,yes it like going into best buy to find a video card you get your regular choices of ati nvidia etc and the third option the government video card you are allowed to buy the g card if you cannot afford the other two ,5,technology
air_gopher,it not a problem as long as the same government is not controlling and regulating their own competition and i am not saying monticello is doing that but that not the case with other issues ,1,technology
air_gopher,yeah i replied to the top comment with a similar suggestion was there nothing stopping another telco from coming in and providing better services ,2,technology
air_gopher,agreed i am pissed at the below average quality of any of the services i have available to me and i only get 2 choices i am tempted to start up a petition get everyone living in my area to sign it stating they want and would pay for better service from a third party and send it to the 2 choices we have plus send it to the rest of the companies in the area letting the first 2 know that as well i do not know if that would work or not but it probably worth a try ,3,technology
air_gopher,there was nothing stopping any other telco company from coming in and installing their own network or am i missing something it seems like a missed opportunity for some other telco kudos to the muni for stepping in and strong arming the corporation s into action ,4,technology
