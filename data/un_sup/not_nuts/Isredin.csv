Isredin,it would be tricky part of the appeal of fallout is the americana so while not impossible would be difficult maybe since they annexed canada that could be explored does not mean it would not be interesting though what happened to hawaii i have also seen the north west washington oregon tossed out as a great area to explore there had to be some areas that would be relatively untouched though or at least not directly hit but the contrast of what was versus what is left is where the story is i feel that metro and s t a l k e r covers russia and eastern europe mad max covers australia though if it was any other country i would love to see the story told from a vault constructed in an ally country un or equivalent somewhere in western europe the vault population would have been composed of both american military and civilians with local ally civilians and military personnel ,9,Fallout

Isredin,book dany does get down with some ladies too ,3,asoiaf
Isredin,if dany wins it a circle we have this current succession of kings in joffery and tommen that are not legitimate themselves and have no heirs succession is the main driver of the plot if dany ends up queen of westeros unless the magically fix her baby maker then everything westeros went through will happen again some years later unless the big twist is the westeros equivalent of the magna carta with the end of their entire political and social structure burn it all indeed ,3,gameofthrones
Isredin,i think that a lot of what arya is going through is part of the waif testing the waif does not really embrace the ideals of the fm and her beef with arya is her test to see if she can be no one or someone who hates arya ,2,gameofthrones

Isredin,yas ,2,FinalFantasy
Isredin,while i am certain that was not the real arya for the same reasons i can also see why it might have been why it probably was not as above plus the fact that arya is a survivor she has to know she is being hunted and would not have gotten away from the hbw so easily the fact that the arya we saw did not look hunted was confident and had her guard down makes me think that was a fm plus the way she walked and held herself was more like how sexy jesus walks and moves so i do not buy it it seems to me that it falls in line with the idea that arya was really a test for the waif not the other way around why it might have been call me crazy but i have this ongoing idea that the end game revolves around who can have kids when all is said and done they story goes out of its way to highlight this dany cannot and that why i do not see her ultimately being queen of westeros if that was the real arya she will still likely survive but taking all those hits in her general womb area might have killed her future as a mother beyond arya and dany the themes of maternity run very strong throughout this story and on a side note might be just another layer of the seven gods and i would not be surprised if that ends up being a huge aspect of this story ,40,gameofthrones
Isredin,my thought though is that varys would have been able to sabotage records of dany or burn contacts ,8,gameofthrones

Isredin,jon so you are kinda not really dead eh benjy benjen yea you too huh jon yea ,2,asoiaf
Isredin,i get that it is magic how else would it be effective versus ww but i always took vs to be a parallel to damascus steel which and i am not metallurgist is special due to it material composition ,5,asoiaf
Isredin,in that vein would a king jamie with marg out of the picture marry dany thought the problem there is no kids from dany so what would be the point i personally the whole thing will end in a right of conquest or have it all be pointless when the wall falls i see kl covered in show and death with just a few survivors standing there and essentially hitting reset on westeros i do not see jon being king either way he was dead can he even have kids dany is in a similar boat on that theme theon would be out too now that i think on it there are a lot of people who have had their ability to have kids taken away i think the real key to figuring out who will sit on what is left of the throne is who can leave a legacy my money is on sansa by right of conquest and the ability to have successors to make the whole struggle worthwhile ,1,asoiaf
Isredin,is not jojen alive in the books ,5,asoiaf

Isredin,jaime will have to get through tormund first ,4,asoiaf
Isredin,my gut reaction is that ned kids were coming into their own and there was not really a place for benjen in winterfell anymore but thinking on it maybe ned and benjen knew that mormont was getting on and might not survive the coming winter it would then be a good time to swoop in and get a stark as senior leadership if not lord commander of the night watch not for the power but they knew how important it was that the nw be strong and would do what they could to beef it up they knew that brothers of the nw were deserting and things must be getting bad but then why would not ned have driven a recruitment campaign for the nw or otherwise supported them perhaps with jon arryn sp dying he had an idea that that he would need all the material support he could get in kl ,1,asoiaf

Isredin,do not forget dany is generally heading east and has been sitting on her hands for a while now grrm likes real world historical parallels and europeans could not get their act together to properly unite against the mongols dothraki the small counsel has other shit to worry about and hurricane dany is blowing the other way ,12,gameofthrones
Isredin,also as varys was headed to dany would not he sabotage or otherwise bury any information that westeros could use ,16,gameofthrones

Isredin,arya blows out the candle so the waif cannot see needle the waif does not know she has it or that it even exists i think the wait will roll in expecting to confront arya with fists or staff and get wrecked but then again what if the waif succeeds what if she takes arya face if the faceless men or girls get arya face will it ever show up again in westeros what if we never see who wins in the struggle between arya and the waif when we next see her onscreen how would we know if it is arya or the waif ,2,gameofthrones
Isredin,the show has one of many themes showing in this episode the idea of succession and the next generation taking over we saw robb try and fail just like his father we see the successes and failures of jon and dany tommen joffery ramsay and now yara and sansa either littlefinger is taken by surprise in how much sansa has grown or he is playing her as he does everyone else he still walked away relatively untouched and if he was caught flat by sansa it wo not happen again the show is building towards r l j even if it does not the theory fits so well that i will just assume it is where things are going all the better twist when it does not i guess however of all the themes and all the plotlines littlefinger is my favorite of all the people playing the game he is one of a few who do not really want the crown he knows that the crown is just a target and the real power is being so far ahead of everyone else they do not know you are even in the game there is no noble intention no glory no legacy just a love of chaos and opportunity ,1,gameofthrones
Isredin,i read the comics ages ago one of my favorite series loved the pilot i am a bit shocked about how cool i am with all the changes they made i feel like the show and the comic can be similar enough in spirit but will be wildly different in execution the show already proved it will be tamer than the comic i was surprised when i saw that was sheriff root and how watered down he was i wo not spoil anything but there is no way they could go full bore comic on the show and not get ripped form the air the outrage over the characters alone and if the overall plot has the same beats the ending to the series alone will go down as the boldest of all time if it makes it i have opened my heart to shows before and been hurt ,4,Preacher
