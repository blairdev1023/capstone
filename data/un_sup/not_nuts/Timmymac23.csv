Timmymac23,i think it because they were getting consistently passed idk probably did not like the change of pace not sure why they are rioting other than the poll reason some people are dressed like kkk members ,0,SubredditDrama
Timmymac23,no no for me it not like that hell the christmas events are memed up as shit and they are hilarious but i doubt they would want to joke around about gay pride anyways no what i meant is that the community should vote for it if they want it i would personally skip the question because again i am never around events anyways but i think that what people are worked up about ,-3,SubredditDrama
Timmymac23,i want some type of other swordsman that just has a campfire or is walking out on the paths and of course have them all be different not a rival type thing and just have them battle you i absolutely adored the dark link fight in oot and the stalfos in oot in the ice room and i just want to fight something that somewhat equal to me to test my strength out i would love this ,1,Breath_of_the_Wild
Timmymac23,look man i do not think the wwf event fit in i do not think this fits in and i think that why the community is making such a ruckus i think the reason they stopped polling events in 2015 was because they had been accepted each year and i think that it is for that reason that they should poll everything i mean christ on a bike this has been an absolute shitfest ,-13,SubredditDrama
Timmymac23,i am an osrs player and dudes i do not care i literally just want it all polled if not yeah it kind of irks me but it is literally because they say they will poll everything i will continue to play and not lose my shit i just wanted them to poll everything at the end of the day i am just going to be killing bloodveld far away from the cities in game so it wo not affect me ,-13,SubredditDrama
Timmymac23,i think people are especially angry against it just because it was not polled ,1,2007scape
Timmymac23,who said that ,1,2007scape
Timmymac23,i read somewhere that rune stones changed shape as the user willed it ,1,2007scape
Timmymac23,probably not if it fits in and it works then cool but usually characters are not so fleshed out in terms of sexuality when it comes to a quest maybe you can say that romeo and juliet is but that quest is about the love of two teenagers so whatever i can dig it but to have jim the gay man with a rainbow above him i am not seeing it man ,1,2007scape
Timmymac23,i guess they could come up with something to make it fit but i highly doubt they are planning on adding lore to runescape for a homosexual pride event that just sounds silly i would say holidays like christmas are kind of a staple in american culture and there are many others in different cultures but one thing that is controversial nowadays and that is not absolutely normalized to see is a gay pride event i am not saying anything other than i just do not see how it fits in and i want someone to tell me how it does really i could give a shit about all of the analogies and such i just do not see how it fits into osrs the way a christmas event does where it one giant meme for a few weeks ,1,2007scape
Timmymac23,who said i did not like it i just do not think it fits ,2,2007scape
Timmymac23, i would not respond to it in such a derogatory manner as i would not to this gay pride event either i just do not think a gay pride event fits into the game for those who may wonder i found the wwf event just as out of place really i just do not think either fit into the game ,1,2007scape
Timmymac23,i am against it because i do not think it fits in runescape at all the fact is that you can talk about it as being as much of a non issue just about all you want but it a controversial political topic and i think everyone just wants to avoid that altogether i do not think most of the oldschool playerbase gives a shit and for that reason they would much rather just have neither a anti gay nor pro gay event they just want to steer clear of it completely ,0,2007scape
Timmymac23,i could i suppose thank the stars that died which resulted in my being here i doubt they would care but it would be funny i guess i do not give praise to any being for my existence i do not think any consciousness or power created anything i really do not think religion makes people more trustworthy how the hell am i supposed to know if bob the christian gardener is a man of his word and for that matter does his faith in a deity define if he is trustworthy how does that make any sense islam is evil huh read the old testament and get back to me on that one basically both islam and christianity are fucked to the core ,11,atheism
Timmymac23,hey man i was religious up until a few years ago i think cosmicskeptic touches on it very well if you care i will post a link when i get back home but basically he posted a video about why he an atheist is afraid of hell it is not that he believes in it but due to being raised in a religious household and having that idea pounded into his head for years as a child he has the irrational fear of it at times it is unfortunate and another horrible side effect of religious thinking you are all good buddy have a good one ,2,atheism
Timmymac23,i will try and level with you i do not in any way believe in any deity or power at all no thank you not for me nor does any evidence support a view like that i get the same bouts of wonder that you experience wherein sometimes i just wonder if this is all that there is i am on earth i live for a while and then i am dead i think it may be normal even perhaps hard wired for us perhaps through evolutionary processes to want to believe in some sort of higher being or power whatever it may be luckily i have gotten much better about reminding myself that i should stay logical do not worry if you have these sorts of thoughts and if you start to take them seriously go on ahead and look up the thousands of religions ideas about higher beings powers etc and figure out which one of them you think might be causing this if any i hope you will remember that it none of them and it just you overthinking it but hey if it makes you sleep better at night ,3,atheism

Timmymac23,on thorrin depending on your faction you might have guns that shoot hard light or sluggers which shoot physical bullets each are feared naturally but for sure no one wants to be killed by a hard light weapon as they cause disintegration from the point of entry think being hit with an alternate ammo shot from half life 2 ,2,worldbuilding

Timmymac23,well it my first ever attempt at making a world basically it has four factions with s section on the eastern mainland being uncontrolled most of the singular continent on the planet is tundra and snow to the north east is a land surrounded by mountain ranges on almost all sides and a nation of pale humanoids who have uncanny prowess in combative magic and a divine being whom they all follow but not worship they have a military which never needs to be called upon but has weaponry that you and i would say looks celestial and deadly to the west is a roman esque empire which has full control over the western lands they like to say they are a republic but really it the monarchs who have all the say and they are real pricks they are in the south is a small nation of secularist humans who have insanely good defenses but they are nothing without them and then there the wizards who live to the southwest and they do not talk much to anyone so i guess it coming along alright ,1,worldbuilding
Timmymac23,lord of the rings meets medieval era global society meets planetside 2 ,2,worldbuilding
Timmymac23,there is one divine being that does not bother with any other group of humans than his own chosen civilization in the north and they do not care about anyone else a group of wizards in the south that keep to themselves and an empire bathed in conquest to the west also it one landmass connected by three land bridges of which the empire controls they all know about each other but either do not give enough craps to attack the other or are too afraid to do so i have not done much in terms of development however as this is new and my first attempt at world building ,1,worldbuilding
Timmymac23,the idea behind it is that since you become a master of slayer you have ample knowledge to randomly decide what you want to slay this way you do not require lunar spell book and can use mage for mage tasks without changing it out which can be a hassle for some and you could also just not have to consistently return to an npc if you are not using npc contact in the first place i just thought it would be convenient without being too overpowered ,2,2007scape
Timmymac23,i would like if you could pick the slayer master it would mimic ,1,2007scape
Timmymac23,it could be an alternative to having rune pouch for slayer ,2,2007scape
Timmymac23,a ten percent chance to be reassigned the last slayer task i just think you should be able to give yourself tasks as a slayer master it would be a guaranteed way of getting a task perhaps with the ten percent perk added and you would not have to consistently go to masters ,0,2007scape

Timmymac23,hi allen my brother and i met you a couple of years ago at the festival of speed just a little bit before closing and i remember it still i just wanted to say you are a great person and meeting you changed my perspective on what i was capable of doing in life keep rocking on man ,1,IAmA
Timmymac23,if by easier you mean easier in the pvm aspect then sure but once the pvp begins it a pvp situation that pvmer is likely unprepared and has no way of knowing a pvper is coming the pvper has an obvious advantage ,3,2007scape
Timmymac23,jeez mate chill out for a bit the logic i had in saying that the broadcast radius should be decreased because it gives pkers an advantage is based on nothing other than the fact that the pvmer cannot even see the pker it is not because i have some sort of bias i do not do wildy pvm i think it is legitimately unfair when a pker knows the location of his target before the victim even knows they are present that is some godly power and frankly i think a pker should actually hunt down their prey rather than be told by the game again this excludes bh because theres a system in bh for specifically that if you are looking to kill someone you know the location of i do not see why you do not stick to bh but hey that not what were talking about basically i think the pker should not have effective radar sorry that bugs you so much ,2,2007scape
Timmymac23,i agree with you it should not be a discussion but pvpers like their advantages to the point of arguing about something as obvious as this ,8,2007scape
Timmymac23,hi i do not understand how this would make pvm easier for wildy pvmers pkers should be limited to what they can hunt down as it was meant to be you hunt other players in the wilderness you should not be told where they are excluding bh worlds ofc i do not think this is unfair and i think your reasoning for saying it is unfair to shrink the radius of the broadcast leaves me unsatisfied and wanting a better explanation it is not about making the game hard for pkers it about making it fair for pvmers who have not got any idea that someone knows they are there without having seen them at all edit also your comment at the end about how op obviously just wants to make it easier for himself and harder for you equates to a childish argument similar to well he just wants to make it tough for me and it does not further your attempt to make op lose credibility in his suggestion ,10,2007scape
Timmymac23,telling him to try and get a video what is dense about that i do not doubt him but jeez he could try and see if it happens again ,2,2007scape
Timmymac23,i think op has a point he is not saying that pvp should not be allowed and i think that the wilderness is a pvp area and therefore pvp is fair game i think he just saying the broadcast radius should be decreased and there is nothing against pvp in saying that ,433,2007scape

Timmymac23,natural selection is the survival of the fittest that is whoever is the best fit to survive will likely survive evolution is the mutation of dna and genes throughout generations of different organisms ,1,technology

Timmymac23,this seems like cruel and unusual punishment,1,news
Timmymac23,dude holy shit there is no harm in a teacher saying yeah so the two main thoughts on how life came to be are intelligent design which is basically where a deity or god designed life and evolution where slow mutations changed species over time one is based on faith and the other on scientific observations and done does that really rustle your jimmies that much ,1,technology
Timmymac23,you are ignorant because you refuse to recognize the theory of intelligent design as one that is significant to our culture and anyways it should be obvious that if you talk about something you also talk about arguments against it so that one can decide what they believe in instead of just teaching them one thing because we see anything else as wrong ,1,technology
Timmymac23,you are ignorant i do not believe intelligent design is how we came to be in fact i am a firm believer in the theory of evolution ,1,technology
Timmymac23,it a significant part of our species and i think we should educate our children with as much as we can ,-1,technology
Timmymac23,i knew this would be brought up and i say to it that since they are not the two major ideas on the origin of life they can be a taught in a history classroom and explained ,-3,technology
Timmymac23,do you not understand that the point is not whether one is correct or not rather that they are two very large places of debate and we should educate people about what both are ,1,technology
Timmymac23,you seem to forget that it holds a large place in how we as humans came to be organized it backwards to try and say that religion has had no part in our society ,0,technology
Timmymac23,the point is not that it a scientific theory or not i understand that it a science class i do but if we are going to talk about evolution we should make an exception for its counterpart intelligent design we cannot just act like it does not have any significance in the world it quite obviously has significance in what we are today ,-2,technology

Timmymac23,there a flaw in your logic and it the assumption that creationism is incorrect sorry to say but if your ego does not allow for you to fathom that you might just possibly be wrong about the origin of life on this planet then you are ignorant ,-6,technology
Timmymac23,i concur and we should do everything in our power to keep religion out of a science classroom it is not to say that we should just act as though it never happened i think we should not teach specific religions in schools unless the school is a private one in which case it can teach whatever religion it wants as long as it is not telling kids to go blow themselves up or shoot others i think however in a science class there should be a little part of one day where the teacher gets the attention of the class and says ok guys so there are these two theories called intelligent design and evolution and just let everyone know what they are so that the kids are endowed with knowledge instead of choosing one over the other ,1,technology
Timmymac23,you are obviously ignorant i do not believe in some god deity or anything mocking is not what i take issue with when it comes to a religion what i take issue with is the fact that you spew crap about wanting free thought and then support telling children in schools that creationism is not true when there is no proof on this earth that disproves it ,-8,technology
Timmymac23,my gosh what do you do for coins ,1,MaddenMobileForums
Timmymac23,you are retarded if you think you are any better than the creationists who are trying to force creation to be taught as truth if you are for having evolution taught as truth they should each be explained and no more so that those who attend these schools can decide for themselves what they believe ,1,technology
Timmymac23,which is where the part of free thought comes into play if someone chooses to believe that evolution is the origin of life then there is no issue if someone chooses to believe that creation is the origin of life then there is also no issue ,-3,technology
Timmymac23,are you ignorant i do not believe in a god but i will be damned if someone else does not have the right to ,-14,technology

Timmymac23,i do not care what agenda you may have if it comes to religion then no we do not know that for a fact but the same goes for everything else as well it time to think and use that brain of yours and see what you are condoning you are saying that free thought is not permitted so why do not we let the scientists priests mathematicians social workers and everything else decide for themselves instead of trying to make them thought slaves i thought we were against controlling what people think but the amount of messages i have gotten that just have tons of people spewing hate on religion just shows that you are basically all salty militant atheists who hate thought other than their own i mean seriously i am not even a religious person ,0,technology

Timmymac23,i agree fully every major religion should be taught in a class dedicated to the subject while i believe that evolution is a scientific subject and as such should be taught in science classes i do think that when atheism is brought up in a world religions class evolution should be touched on as well basically since there are two major theories evolution and intelligent design they should both be explained in a science classroom since intelligent design seems to be the norm in terms of religion then we should touch on it in a world religions class but also touch on evolution as being the main theory that most atheists accept as being the origin of humanity sorry for the wall of text i suck at explanations and i am also playing for glory on smash bros lol,1,atheism

Timmymac23,first let me just say thank you for not being rude about anything i appreciate it usually this type of comment chain goes far differently for me so could not we say that radicalism exists in everything who to say that there are not atrocities committed in the name of capitalism and communism alike or religion and a theism we can look at china for example many religious people are in fact persecuted for their beliefs it is not just christianity as most people think when they hear that term but religion is effectively taboo there due to the harsh consequences or we can take a look at the pp shooting that took place just recently someone did not very much like planned parenthood and they took their anger out on people by shooting up a pp center i cannot remember if his motives were religiously centered or not so please forgive me for that basically i am saying that the potential for radicalization exists in any ideology and that we cannot just focus on a few ideologies of course you can make a perfectly valid point of the fact that most of the atrocities we hear about are religiously motivated and i ask you what we can do when possibility becomes reality and we have many more radical ideas ,2,atheism
