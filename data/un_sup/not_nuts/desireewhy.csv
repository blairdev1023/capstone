desireewhy,that was my first question too ,1,creepy
desireewhy,what no it not sometimes it takes more than five years for someone to speak to a professional especially over something as traumatic as this it also not just daddy issues but mommy issues that op probably has to deal with and it never too late to go back to school so how is that invalid advice i say it very valid and both suggestions could probably help op get on with their life ,6,nosleep
desireewhy,does the auto feeder help we were thinking about getting one but they can be so expensive ,1,AnimalBehavior
desireewhy,that is actually a pretty good idea it also in a weird way kind of cute i will give it a go thanks for the suggestion ,1,AnimalBehavior
desireewhy,thank you so much for the advice i will definitely look into it and see what we can try it a little ironic too that you mention it could be their food as we are having different problems with our other cat we feed them science diet which is supposed to be one of the best cat foods and naturally we want the best for them poppy will eat it and seems content our other cat however oswin will eat some of it and leave the rest she also started doing this sort of recently and so we thought it might be the bowl since she would always go over to poppy bowl whenever she did not want to finish so we switched their bowls and it worked for a bit but now she doing it again we have incorporated some wet food into their diet i cannot remember the brand but it is not one of the awful cheap ones and she will always finish it so i almost wonder if she just does not like the dry food anymore anyway enough about that i will look into what you suggested and hopefully things change thank you for your help d,1,AnimalBehavior
