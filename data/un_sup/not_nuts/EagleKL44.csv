EagleKL44,my thought process exactly r leikale i wished we could have had romney or a more promising young and upcoming candidate that we could have relied on but we did not i said to my parents at the beginning of the primaries that all trump had to do was borderline outrageous things that everyone thinks but no one says honestly he really was a breath of fresh air into politics normally it two candidates who say the politically correct thing even when their party opposes the topic here comes trump saying nah fuck that it sucks you and i both know it sucks if you think it does not suck you are wrong and i am gonna prove you wrong once i fix it we have not seen anything like him in the modern presidential era really i think if anyone else went up against hillary she would have won but trump ran a beautiful campaign you really do have to admire it statistically speaking he identified hillary weaknesses exploited them let the polls convince everyone he was a long shot and then swooped in for the win i do not like trump i voted for him and still i support him because he is my president and i really could not stand bernie or hillary ,2,AskReddit

EagleKL44,hazing and to be clear im talking about high school sports college fraternity and not to be confused with bullying growing up all throughout my high school collegiate sports career if you were freshman you were hazed forced to do extra push ups and extra suicide runs forced to carry equipment and the seniors bags usually perform 1 or 2 embarrassing public acts like wear tu tus over your jeans 1 day to school it was stupid and fun i did not mind it at all joining a college fraternity the hazing was definitely more hardcore but it was still all mental 1 mile jogs at 3am forced to sleep in the basement with your pledge brothers w nothing to actually sleep on aka you are getting zero sleep had to wear dress shirt and tie to class on mondays and fridays now none of that shit flys my fraternity just got put on notice because last semester some libtard social justice warrior reported that during her lunch everyday she would see the same kid bring another kid lunch and carry his backpack one of the seniors would go to work and then make a pledge bring him his class materials and a sandwich before class that 1 incident put the whole chapter on probation so stupid ,2,AskReddit

EagleKL44,yes he did 26 weeks pay and a small bonus ,1,legaladvice
EagleKL44,he was a senior product distribution manager that was as general as i can pu it without getting to personal i believe he stated that the non compete said it limited him from signing with competitors clients aka distributors or using company knowledge to advise a different company also cannot go into product distribution within the industry as a whole ,3,legaladvice
EagleKL44,sign this or lose your job that not forced but it a lose lose situation he cannot use his 30 years of knowledge towards finding a new job in the industry and if he does not sign it he risks losing his job of over 30 years no one forced him to sign anything but he was boxed into a corner and told to jump off the ledge left or right ,12,legaladvice
EagleKL44,yes he was forced to i addressed this in a few posts above but yes he was forced to sign or be let go so he signed ultimately knowing it was the writing in the wall anyways ,4,legaladvice
EagleKL44,i doubt it he spoke briefly in the car and it seems more geared towards consolidating positions i do think he was targeted specifically because he older earning a healthy salary but he would have brought up that they targeted ages seems like he was a by product of an attempt to shed salaries and save money in the long run ,85,legaladvice
EagleKL44,do not know i am back at work now i had to pick him up as he had a company car and company phone he called and asked me to pick him up as they were taking both ,9,legaladvice
EagleKL44,exactly i was told by a friend at work that non competes in most cases are generally not enforceable because companies often deploy them right before a firing essentially a sign this or you are fired ultimatum which they generally fire you anyways it a lose lose situation he just told me he signed the no compete on or around the 6th of april a series of firings happened the next week and 2 weeks later aka today 4 21 he was let go ,73,legaladvice
EagleKL44,they did offer half year severance he 62 and it not likely he will go to a different industry to learn the tricks and trade i was more asking towards the non compete if its enforceable or not any work arounds ,22,legaladvice
EagleKL44,sorry yes he did there was about 30 50 employees this is a large corporation with nearly 50k employees that were asked aka told to sign the non compete they had 24 48 hours to sign and return to their boss my dad was pretty high up the chain of command so he was shocked and knew it was weird timing after all these years he tried to band together with several other members in a similar role than him strength in numbers but a few caved and then the rest all signed and followed suit last week they fired about a dozen and then today he told me they fired even more himself being one of them i do not know the specifics but i do know the non compete said no competitors or distributors within the industry and he also cannot deal with product distribution which is what division he was in i know nj and pa are liberal and pro employee for the most part but non competes are still like the mark of death during a hiring process ,71,legaladvice

EagleKL44,i almost got expelled for paraphrasing a couple sentences in one of my senior level 300 classes and forgetting to cite them as a reference i know that sounds like a cop out but it was towards the end of the 1st semester senior year in college and i was working 30 hours a week between 2 jobs addiitionally i was an officer on student government vice president of the intra fraternity council and held a pretty significant chair position within my fraternity i also participated as a campus ambassador giving tours to potential new students all in all i was fairly well known by university staff and several faculty members i had some bullshit paper for an economics class due and no time to do it we had to interview someone with a job and i cannot remember exactly but the assignment had something to do with how it related to some topic we were talking about in class so i interview my buddy ryan who was a manager student of some sort at the campus rec center he has been there since freshman year and basically set the schedules and ran the intramural program well we conducted the interview and at the end he gave me the new employee handbook for reference in case i needed it few days later i work in the morning at job 1 then go to my two classes 2 3 3 4 then worked 5pm 11pm at job 2 as a bar back waiter get home and i am exhausted knowing i have to write this paper long story short i was up until close to 3 4am writing this paper and i have a 9am i turn in the paper and 3 days later received a voicemail from my professor requesting i come to office hours after the next class i go to class she wo not even make eye contact with me which was unusual as i sat relatively close to the front every time and generally participated she would not even call on me if i raised my hand after class i go to her office and she starts fuming how i tried to pull 1 over on her she explained she had highlighted 3 sentences throughout the course of my paper that were eerily identical to what was listed in the campus rec center new employee handbook truth be told i do not even remember if i referenced the handbook or just went off my notes from how my buddy answered the questions i explained to her my situation work tired notes from the interview forgot to cite the handbook but she would not budge next she informed me she was filing a plagiarism report so it can be formally documented i had to sit with the professor and department chair then again alone with the department chair who then made the ruling and sided with the teacher i was allowed to appeal to the assistant dean of the college of business public affairs who upheld the ruling i personally knew the dean of the college of b pa and asked for a special meeting which he granted as a favor he recommended that i request a ruling from a board of my peers as it would be inappropriate of him to overturn his assistants ruling good news is if the peer board ruled in my favor i could expect a ruling anything from the charges dropped and rewrite the paper or receive a 0 on that assignment but remain academically eligible bad news is they could also uphold the ruling to expel me on the grounds of plagiarism by the grace of god i walked into the room that day and saw that i knew 1 of the peer students on the board he had been on student government the prior year and sat to my right during the meetings he knew the type of person i was and i believe convinced the other 4 board members to rule in my favor as the teacher refused to let me back into her classroom the board ruled i receive an incomplete for the class does not affect my gpa but does show up on my transcript i remained academically eligible took the class again that winter with a professor that loved me and heard about my situation he let me submit all assignments i completed under the previous teacher for full credit minus that goofed up paper that started all this and even let me improve them first to bring up the grade if i wished finished that winter course with a 97 and then went on to graduate in the spring funny thing is that bitch professor i kept seeing all over campus that spring i would walk past her head held high and her eyes would being pointed right at that floor i may have mumbled and called her a bitch during a few passing she was on the stage when i walked across and got my diploma and i skipped shaking her hand even though she did extend it so i did not officially get expelled but i was down to my last lifeline ,2,AskReddit

EagleKL44,you do know this entire thing is based off of a comic book right similar to got but different in their own story telling ways the show is following the comic in a fairly accurate way got has maybe 10 episodes in a season so they condense everything down to fit into the time they have as a reader of the ice fire series i am often shocked how much material and background they leave out just to fit their time restraints i really wish they would have set up the entire series better with more in depth look at each character walking dead has almost twice the episodes and genuinely does make a fair attempt to give each character some form of background character development because well they have the time you seem like the type of show watcher that clicks through their phone until boom action happens and deaths occur walking dead is a story about life after the apocalypse it not all slashing walkers and shooting other groups most of the time is finding out how to find supplies find shelter then fortify and defend it and how to come together as a group of mutual interests yeah killing rogue groups killing walkers that are a threat or avoiding herds are also major parts but without the background as to why they are doing what they are doing or why a character ticks the way they do you literally just have a low budget shitty netflix action flick on your hands ,2,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,bro their are 318 9 million legal americans they sent a survey out to their own mailing list and a sample size of 11k answered the survey first we do not know how biased this list is where do they obtain these people could it very well be they sent it out to every e mail in their database or do they have certain demographics that segregated and defined this list and while theoretically as you mentioned the poll in accurate to within 1 i would still like to see a greater percentage of the overall population ,1,politics

EagleKL44, romneycare applies to 6 5 million residents of the commonwealth of ma the aca covers over 300 million spread across 50 diverse states romneycare was written to meet the unique needs of that states residents meanwhile the aca is a sweeping generalization across the nation catering to only the needs of the sickly aca requires all insurance policies to cover preventative services no co pays or deductibles it designed to promote wellness and diagnose issues at the earliest stages it very commendable and a great feature but it does increase the costs romneycare allowed insurers to require co pays or deductibles therefore offsetting some cost romney also did not have to increase taxes or make any cuts to medicare obama increased taxes leading to further national debt and cut medicare by a significant portion the size and scale of rcare to ocare is apples to oranges not to mention romney publicly denounces obamacare even though it adopted many of his plans ideas and expanded them to what they are now ,2,AskReddit
EagleKL44,yeah but there is free will there no body until obama built a system where the healthy was forced to buy insurance specifically to fund the poor and sickly before insurance companies would accept or deny the risk of insuring potential clients now they are forced to take them and give them coverage ,2,AskReddit
EagleKL44,but once again you are wrong it all good and fun to dream and hope to one day accomplish that mission the fact remains that someone is paying for the expensive care that is being received by those who cannot afford it the aca is a mess for all the reasons i have explained to you and it wo not work setting it or something like it up on the backs of healthy hand working americans you are never going to convince every single person that it is right hell i do not think i should have to pay for someones welfare or health insurance simply because i applied myself took out loans paid back loans and successfully busted my ass to run my own business and now able to afford my own health care it a dreamers mentality and while i welcome it and applaud it the reality remains that it is not an option the aca is failing and there is nothing to be done to save it because people cannot afford the insane premiums that are caused by very expensive treatments being received by the sick without the aca those same less fortunate would not receive those expensive treatments which is why premiums were less expensive before the aca hence why i lost so much business from the aca which started this whole conversation you can keep dreaming but i live in the reality that a universal health care system will never work when the sick receive expensive treatments and the healthy are penalized and told they have to pay for that treatment ,1,AskReddit
EagleKL44,ok but who is paying for the human rights based health care you want to tax people universal tax just like canada i would love to see how that plays out i am no tax expert but what i do know is that there are thousands of loopholes and exceptions when it comes to taxes i could not even begin to imagine the problems that would come out of trying to tell people they now have to pay a tax for someone else to go to the doctor you would go through so many legal battles involving trying to set up a universal health care tax ,2,AskReddit
EagleKL44,ok then explain to me why the only insurance companies still in most of the marketplaces available on the exchanges are the for profit insurance companies because the non for profits could not continue to operate in the market due to massive losses from the excessive claims from people receiving treatment i feel like i am banging my head against the wall here trying to explain economics to you non for profits simply operate without being profitable when the aca went into effect and they offered coverage they soon saw the high amount and expensive claims come through since they do not have additional reserved capital to offset those costs they had to back out of the marketplace meanwhile for profit insurance companies such as aetna humana unitedhealthcare they had reserve capital so while they took a hit on the expensive claims they could pull from their reserve capital and pay those claims then they did some analysis to determine in order to stay in the market they would need to offset some cost by raising premiums for the whole pool of customers based on the costs of the sick they likely also pulled profits from other parts of their business ie group insurance profits in order to remain profitable and continue to have reserve capital which every company needs in order to operate basically if it was not for the profitable insurance companies many of these sick poor people would have zero options available so i would argue they are trying to do the right thing by offering their coverage as an option willingly knowing they will lose money on it ,2,AskReddit
EagleKL44,do you even know how to run a business lost profits are a huge problem if you have a business which has a brick and mortar store plus ou have online sales well lets say the overhead expenses for operating that b m store is 5 000 a month now on a given month you sell 4 000 worth of goods in your store meanwhile you sell another 4 000 online wow you have a net profit of 3 000 yes you are absolutely correct their is a loss of profit but you are still making money in the sense of business why would you even keep that brick mortar store you are eating into your maximum profit of 4 000 a month that exactly what is happening these insurance companies have stockholders without them their would be no company stockholders are going to invest in the business that maximizes profits so if a insurance company decides to play mr humanitarian and by your suggestion take the hit and offer cheaper rates for everyone they will in turn be less profitable the stockholders will be pissed vote to replace the board of govenors or chair person or whomever will be able to make a change or they sell their shares and invest elsewhere economics ,2,AskReddit
EagleKL44,im sorry but that is completely wrong you want to blame health insurance companies and stockholders but its simple ecconomics that raise the premiums when obamacare and its crack job team implemented this plan they predicted a certain cost well they were off by about 2 5 billion that the amount that insurance companies lost in 2015 because guess what they had to pay more claims than expected literally if you were sick you went to get coverage no big surprise but the insurance companies lost out big time to account for these losses they needed to do what that right raise the premiums because sick people are getting medical help do not blame them and cost these companies billions in lost profts they have to raise the premiums to offset the loss please do not even say well that their problem if they lose money people get laid off company cannot afford to operate the whole 9 yards anyways some companies took such huge hits in certain areas that they decided they cannot afford to operate in that area and provide coverage the less companies operating in a marketplace less competition no need to lower those rising premiums which are high because they are losing money to so many health claims as more sick people have insurance they get more expensive treatment and drugs which cost more these expensive costs literally drive up the cost of premiums for the entire pool for insurance customers it not the companies many are still losing millions in the individual market and offsetting it with higher premiums and their group insurance business honestly it all boils down to sick people receiving cheaper insurance on their end but racking up thousands of costs for their treatments ,3,AskReddit
EagleKL44,this is actually the scenario i was discussing in the other comments r itsyounotme707 is struggling to afford his mandated health care now lets say hypothetically he could not enroll and take an annual penalty 375 x 12 4 500 in annual premium hes paying under aca well if he takes the penalty of lets call it 2 500 for the year he now has an additional 2 000 he can save for his future or spend on the economy i assume i do not need to explain the benefits of people spending money on our economy hundreds of thousands of people have already realized this and are taking this route and risking that they will remain in good health so now if something should happen to them they are screwed and the money they were supposed to pay to the aca in premium is cut in half when they happens enough times as it currently is the aca collapses on itself which is currently is ,2,AskReddit
EagleKL44,well their really is no option the aca is going to fail by 2019 maybe 2018 there will not be enough money in the aca in the form of annual premiums for the less fortunate to receive medical care keep in mind they are paying for insurance they just receive it at a discount because the healthy people who are theoretically enrolled in coverage are helping they pay the premium for the less fortunate person people are opting out and taking the penalty because their premiums are rising which causes them to not enroll and raises premiums for those still enrolled it like playing jenga you can keep stacking people who cannot afford health care onto the plan but eventually when you remove most of the bottom building blocks ie healthy people paying premiums the tower comes crashing down early estimates are by 2019 there will not be enough money in the system to provide coverage for the people who are benefiting most from this plan you bring up the fact that republicans have nothing to replace it with to which i answer you are right but not for the reasons why you may think the fact is there is nothing to replace obamacare with you could revise it and say it is now the law for everyone to have medical coverage but then the aclu and tons of lawsuits happen and its determined its unconstitutional and we are back to square 1 or maybe it is constitutional and now you have the problem of what to do with people that cannot afford it but are forced to well now people find cheaper places to live they do not go out and spend money on goods which stimulates our economy everyone who is up against a budget will have to cut back is that the sacrifice you want in order for sick people to have free or cheap coverage a busted depressed economy revolved around a law forcing medical coverage on people or lets take canada rout everyone can wait 6 months to see a doctor about that lump in their throat which turns out to be cancer shame they could not go see a private doctor and get treatment right away that poor person with pneumonia can still go to the er but imagine 2 day wait times i was in the er around christmas with someone with a cracked rib it took 7 hours to see a doctor i swear to god i am not trying to be facetious but these are realities i never see anyone discussing it always just well you are greedy because you do not wanna help the less fortunate i am sorry but if i do not look out for what best for me i will end up right there next to that person needing a bailout as well i hate to say it but gov t forced healthcare system tend to have serious flaws its a tragedy and i wish i could come up with someone to say is a solid replacement but i have not and it could be the truth that there is no improved system we could come up with ,4,AskReddit
EagleKL44,well the underlying problem with the aca is that it is built upon the design that the healthy mostly young and mid aged but older aged as well are enrolled in health care and paying their premiums which allows for the discounted rates for those less fortunate the problem started when those healthy employees trying to make ends meet were forced into buying coverage or paying a penalty considering before the aca many did not have coverage and when they went to the doctor would pay out of pocket they decided to take the penalty because it was cheaper than paying the annual premium as i said people do what they can to make ends meet when they are on a tight budget well now the annual premiums for everyone else just rose and now the next level of employees who previously could afford the forced medical coverage reevaluate their coverage and see that their annual premium was 1000 but now rose to 1500 and you see now they start feeling the pressure because they are up against their budget but guess what they can take a 1000 penalty if they decide to not enroll and that is what they do the cycle starts all over again the next level of employees see their premiums raise from 1500 to 2000 and they now cannot afford coverage so they opt out for a penalty that in the end has them pay less for no coverage than it would for coverage and remember these people are theoretically healthy so you might ask well when they need coverage and they do not have it they will be screwed so they are stupid you are right everyone should have coverage but some people look at it like ok i can pay 1000 penalty the 400 bill for that 1 doctor visit when i had the flu and end up with a total cost of 1400 versus the 2000 the gov t is forcing me to pay i still spend less i deal with these situations all the time and i cannot blame people for thinking that way because when you live in a major metro area and your rent is 1500 car payment is 800 every 6 months food gas basic living necessities and now you are forced to add an additional 2000 to that annual budget push comes to shove people decide not to opt in to the gov t aca program the system is set up to fail and it is failing honestly take a look at this video it from the ceo of aetna one of the largest players in insurance he saying everything that i just explained above link to wsj http www wsj com video aetna ceo on obamacare death spiral c56c5a63 85c9 4be2 92c2 a0587d096af3 html this is exactly why the aca needs to be repealed replaced or at the very least heavily heavily revised edit sorry i provided the wrong link now updated with wall street journal video ,2,AskReddit

EagleKL44,i never said you said anything i was simply pointing out the hypocrisy of people who label anyone as a racist homophobe xenophobe etc etc when for voting trump before they even hear their reasoning without knowing that persons character i was in philly this past week with my girlfriend when all the commotion was going on in the city we are at a bar and someone comments on the tv which has trump on the screen after several derogatory terms were used to describe trump supporters i commented that i myself voted trump and before i could even explain their faces nearly turned red in front of me and words started flying about how can i support a racist homophobic islamophobic you get the point president and if i even support him the littlest bit then i must be a racist too and then my girlfriend comes back from the bathroom and i subtly hold her hand grab my beer and walk away it insane to think someone is a racist or whatever without knowing them or hearing them out i am not saying or using the i have a mixed raced gf therefore i cannot be racist argument i do however find it funny that i do have a mixed race girlfriend and just because our beliefs align with the current president then i am suddenly a bad person hell i have even been called a nazi like ok yup go take a chill pill and sit in your safe space to calm down ,1,AskReddit

EagleKL44,i voted trump and i would have to agree that people are acting pretty crazy i have been called a racist even though i am currently dating a girl who is half white half black i have been told i must be homophobic even though my old college roommate is gay and i regularly meet with him and his so out in the city for dinner with my so i have even been to gay bars and the pride parade in philly several times someone said i only voted trump because i am a white male who afraid of losing my white privilage which is odd because last i checked my family was in the middle income brakcet and i had to take out student loans for undergrad and grad school and absolutely work my ass off to get to where i am today granted i am not denying there are not social injustices out there but i by no means had life handed to me on a silver platter i voted trump besides not trusting hillary and personally disliking the shit out of that entire family because i work in the insurance industry and the aca absolutely makes my work a pain in the ass on a daily business not only could i be selling more and making more but i see literally dozens of businesses on a daily basis choose not to offer group insurance products to their employees because the cost is just too high i also disagree with the former administrations leniency towards iran and other countries with terrorist red flags all the while spurning one of our biggest allies in israel i could go on an on but really my point here is that their are pro and anti trumpers out there who can discuss politics in a civil way and then there are those that just sling insults ,1,AskReddit

EagleKL44,the difference is obama policy stopped the new application process one that was clearly flawed hence the stoppage that obama imposed any issued green card or visas were not affected keep in mind this is the visa process that allowed the san bernadino shooters to leave the us arrive in the middle east and return which they later and commit acts of terror just for example ya know trumps policy stops the new application process as well as all issued green cards and visas as i mentioned obama administration originally identified the application process as being flawed therefore someone dangerous could have been issued a green hard or visa into the country trumps policy is looking into these flaws reviewing past applications and prevents any current issues with refugees while i truly do feel sympathetic towards any refugees who have family in the us and simply want to create a safer legitimate lifestyle i also strongly feel they need to do so in a safe and proper way the stoppage on immigration and refugees is simply piece of gum on a leak in a dam it not a one all fix all but it is a pause that is going to let officials review and hopefully fix what is wrong and allow for a safer vetting process in the future http heavy com news 2017 01 barack obama ban refugees did iraq iraqi muslim trump jimmy carter iran iranian immigration ,0,pics
EagleKL44, mr obama in 2011 imposed a six month pause on iraqi refugees after the fbi concluded that terrorists had managed to exploit the program one person was admitted even though his fingerprints were found on an improvised explosive device in iraq problems persisted even after that two men who entered as refugees from iraq including one who d most recently lived in syria were charged with terrorism related crimes a year ago www washingtonpost com amphtml news fact checker wp 2017 01 29 trumps facile claim that his refugee policy is similar to obama in 2011 ,3,pics

EagleKL44,yeah but those corporations do not want to have to move and reinvest in other countries they will if they have to but it easier for them to lobby in favor of the easier solution which is mexico cooperating with us ,0,politics
EagleKL44,exactly and that hurts mexico which they cannot afford why do you think trump is doing this he a business man he knows the us companies operating in mexico wo not like this it puts pressure on them which they can either put pressure on the mexican government to comply or figure out other business opportunities which puts pressure on mexico to work out a deal he has the leverage hurt your opponents wallet and that will get them to start thinking differently ,1,politics
EagleKL44,i understand your points but sometimes things do not come as easy as they should i agree right now mexico has no reason to submit it like a seige almost they will hold out until it no longer makes sense for them to do so loss in jobs value of the peso etc etc will push them in the cooperating direction i also think while trump makes promises such as mexico will cooperate and we start the wall in a couple of months i really do not think it going to matter if they cave sooner or later so far he been remarkably consistent with his campaign promises even cnn ran a article about it ,1,politics
EagleKL44,oh definitely i fully expect they are like ehh fuck it we will figure it out international trade is not simple though like i said they can contact russia china japan australia etc etc but how are they going to replace the 80 of their exports going to us alone i remember reading about due to the open trade barriers with the us our corn production essentially wiped mexico off the map and now they import our corn i realize this is a small example pretty insignificant really but how many further examples are there like that one out there their entire agriculture system was seriously hurt from nafta because small farmers could no longer compete with the decline in food costs when it was first put in place most those workers moved to manufacturer jobs which came from the us it a huge cycle loss of manufacturing jobs due to decline in demand mean layoffs or whole facilities shut down to go elsewhere now you have a huge unemployment number it just one domino after another sure they can stay strong but i think it wo not even get to case ,1,politics
EagleKL44,was a joke but really i have no answer i am guessing it never gets to that point us corporations getting screwed over will likely lobby mexico to comply and cooperate with the us and support stricter border barriers if that does not happen then the decline in demand for mexico products will force them to look to sell their goods elsewhere i can see some mild success there but not like how they had with the us trump is playing a chess match and holds more pieces mexico does not have many options other then to cooperate ,1,politics
EagleKL44,well they do not have free trade agreements with those other countries plus they would incur a cost of trading internationally with the other major players china russia australia you gotta ship the products there right now they just have to truck their goods across the border i am not saying it cannot happen but it likely wont they can say they will all they want but it does not make sense financially yall can stay on your sky is falling agenda i will remain on mine which is about securing the national border growing our economy fixing the inner cities which i am from and improving the national infrastructure ,1,politics
EagleKL44,overnight bruh didnt you know rome was built in a day ,1,politics
EagleKL44,oh yeah man they are gonna start growing them in wisconsin and north dakota so you are proposing we should not secure our borders because of avocados tomatoes can be farmed elsewhere hell my mom has a tomato plant in her inside garden year round i am clearly referring to us manufacturers the ones that moved down there at the beginning of nafta,0,politics
EagleKL44,first off if you are drinking beer from mexico it likely corona and that shit is pisswater anyways landshark all day mofo second i drink tea third while tequila is delicious it already more expensive to rock shots of that at a bar versus whiskey bourbon all day err day fourth i will miss avocados but it is a sacrifice i am willing to make since there always queso ,-16,politics
EagleKL44,at which point the us companies will likely lobby the mexican gov t to comply in some way or they could choose to leave to another country and mexico economy will stagnant and regress as they send 80 of their exports to the us trump knows this and is playing poker with mexico calling their bluff they cannot afford to not send their products here or face a depression of some sort you are right the tariff will not bring in any significant funds but the move of imposing a tariff is not to raise money it to bottleneck and suffocate the mexican economy so they have no other choice ,-7,politics
EagleKL44,let me ask how fucking stupid are you i clearly stated they would just more to another country as i noted someplace like panama or they could return to the us what is the argument you are making here if they move to another country then you will still get your cheaper consumer goods and any continuing products from mexico will come to us with a 20 tax increase if you are that hellbent on buying mexican products then do so and yeah pay for the wall mexico economy meanwhile will be stagnant and regress as they send nearly 80 of their exports to us cannot do that anymore when there is no demand for their product this whole thing is a fucking poker match mexico is bluffing and trump is calling their bluff no way mexico can afford to lose favorable relations with us ,-14,politics
EagleKL44,except when those companies begin to realize it is no longer profitable to remain in mexico they will begin to either pressure the mexican gov t to cooperate with us policies or will flat out leave and return to the us bringing those jobs with them they are not going to pay to make equally expensive items internationally if they are a us company they will move those jobs home or move them to a country that has a more favorable trade agreement with the us boom cheaper consumer goods are being produced again just now they are in panama for example or cost of living goes down as the economy is stimulated due to 500 k jobs returning to the us technically 800k manufacturing jobs moved to mexico due to nafta ,-53,politics

EagleKL44,unless they move to a different country with more favorable relations to us just want to point out they likely wo not move back home and that ok they will go to panama or canada or some country that has some fucking respect for our border and laws mexico is like that little brother that wants to play backyard football with the big boys but gets steamrolled on the first possession cries and acts like they are alright even when they are not ,8,The_Donald
EagleKL44,because there is no way mexico can lose us as a trade partner we import 80 of their exports free of tax mexico and trump are literally playing a poker game right now except mexico has a 2 pair and us has a full house they threaten to leave nafta or find other trade partners well hello 1 mexico needs us more than we need them and 2 go ahead and start trading with china it will cost more to ship them over there vs sending them to your next door neighbor us mexico is in a lose lose position but playing the part to look good politically,1,worldnews
EagleKL44,not exactly once companies mostly manufacturers see their profit margins get cut into they will either choose to move to a different company with more favorable trade agreements or move back to the us and avoid all taxes and regulations either way it will hurt mexico as they will lose jobs and money wo not be flowing in their economy i still gladly pay more for american products when able usually more reliable of a product ,1,worldnews
EagleKL44,thank you on another thread no one can comprehend this method we are literally only trading with mexico because of nafta which allows for the free trade aka no taxes on goods coming across the us border if you suddenly impose taxes on those goods then it neutralizes the difference in cost between mexican made goods and us mexico products will rise in cost at which point manufacturers will decide it not cost effective to have their plants there any longer they may move back to the us or they may move to another country with favorable trade agreements with the us either way this will hurt the mexican economy nearly 80 of their exports go to the us they need us way more than we need them 800k jobs moved from the us to mexico after nafta was signed and implemented due to cheaper labor down there the loss of those jobs and the lack of demand for their products is going to stagnant their economy trump can even take things a step further and impose a tax on all remittances being sent to the us 25 billion yes billion was sent from migrant workers in the us to their families in mexico you impose even a 10 tax on that amount and you get 250 million i hear alot of people say well then they will figure out another way to get the money there ok sure go underground find a way to hide it but that will cost them money too ,2,worldnews

EagleKL44,you are looking at this like theres 1 rule to govern all it not that but i think it fairly simple if you are in southern nj you are closer to phl then ny i would expect you to then be an eagles fan meanwhile if you live in northern jersey you are much more likely to be a giants jets fan if you are somewhere in between then you have the eagles jet giants to choose from it all about how are you geographically related to the local markets of course we recognize fans that are fans due to their fathers and grandfathers i am not gonna knock a buddy of mine for being a vikings fan living in philly when his dad was born and raised in minnesota so what about someone living on the border of ohio and pa he close to pittsburgh but technically lives in the state of ohio what about someone from vermont are you a buffalo fan patriots fan or are you allowed to be a ny giants jets fan i ski up there every year and those 4 teams are the mix of what i see up there if you are a cowboys fan in philly because your father or grandfather was born and raised in texas as you are a fan by the product of your environment then while we will give you shit for it i think we as a fan base will be more understanding however if you are a cowboys fan while your dad is a fan of the eagles or another team then you have no allegiance to your local markets or your family we do not recognize your claim to be a true fan and furthermore we condemn your fuckery you are a fan simply because aikman or emmit smith dominated the early 90 when you were 8 years old then you are a fair weather fan and claiming you like winning teams as the reason for not liking the eagles or philles and you are a fan of the cowboys and yankees then you are just the worst type of person on this earth ,2,sports
EagleKL44,i hate to admit it but i think dak is a starting qb and a good one at that he has the legs and ability to extend plays or reach a first down on his own he cam newtownesque as they can let him take a qb draw up the middle and not worry about him being demolished his throws are mostly accurate and with good speed now note i said good i do not think he is great or will ever become top 5 qb brady mannings rodgers luck etc his throwing motion is a little longer not by much but a split second slower he obviously benefits from an extremely talented offense and players around him zeke is key here because the o line is so strong at run blocking they are able to open up holes and get the d on their heels so when dak drops back to pass he not only has time especially on a pa but his wr are talented and shifty see beasley enough to get separation when they run the ball effectively all dak needs to do is complete those 7 10 yard hitches curls and crossing routes usually getting the ball into the hands of dez on a 7yr hitch will lead to a 10 12 yard gain because of his talent this all leads up to a stat line along the lines of 18 26 245yds 1 2 tds 0 1 int and 15 30 rush yds meanwhile zeke scores 2td and they knock through a field goal or two and put up 27 30pts romo had has much more of a pure qb skill then dak the touch he had on the ball was what you saw of rodgers this past weekend he puts the ball in small spaces i have not seen dak do that on a consistent basis he had some helluva throws during the course of the year but even when i saw one of them i always felt like it was more him throwing it to a spot and the ball just made it through somehow or dez went up and got it for him i think hes going to be a good and consistent qb definitely the starter for years to come for dallas i am not ready to compare him to cam or russell i see him more like an alex smith with higher upside right now extended plays accurate wo not lose the game for you i think if you replaced 1 2 of those lineman and dez started to decline hypothetically speaking you would see a difference in his ultimate qb play ,1,eagles

EagleKL44,no by his logic if you grew up in a non nfl market you would theoretically be a free agent fan i am from philly as well but i know plenty of steelers fan in particular my best friend who i met in college is from harrisburg h burg is smack dab middle of the state between pittsburg and philly he ended up going with the steelers because his grandfather moved there in the 70 when the steelers were killing it and when we were growing up in the early 90 the eagles sucked and steelers did not if you are from mobile alabama you can root for whoever the hell you want the closest team is what the titans op is trying to say if you live in seattle and you are a cowboys fan then it because when seattle was struggling they gravitated towards the cowboys just because they were good aka you are a fair weather fan ,3,sports

EagleKL44,but how can that be if the ride i requested was later cancelled by the driver because i was a no show since the app was not working i could not see if a driver was coming this was a completely different ride request ,2,Lyft
EagleKL44,your guess is as good as mine as to how the pick up location changed basically i originally entered i was at 123 abc street and going to 123 bca avenue i ordered the lyft at which time the screen went blank and i could not get the app to work and after 5 minutes i closed down the app and instead opened up uber which took us home the next morning i saw the notification that my ride was complete and under the detailed report it says my pickup location was 789 xyz street and the destination was set for atlantic city i have no idea how this ride was even generated let alone why the pick up location even different than the original pick up location and yes once lyft customer service reached out to me and i explained my story they said they would look into it and i received an e mail stating they are reversing the charge so i am assuming they were able to tell i clearly did not take this ride ,2,Lyft
EagleKL44,it appears the cancellation was for a different driver the details for the cancelled ride said the pickup location was for the correct place i requested it even though the app was not working for me after i hit request i am not sure how after the first ride was cancelled that the next ride the fraud one was even generated by the time the request was made i was already home safe and sound with my gf the request pick up location was set for roughly 1 5 miles away from my apartment and the destination was set for atlantic city nj while i had a few beers on nye i was fully aware of my surroundings and at no time did i even open the lyft app after i exited and stopped the app since it was not working no the drive or someone else did not use my credit card or the number to order a ride somehow the ride request was generated within the app as i have detailed report in my ride history that the driver picked me up at 12 54am and dropped me off at 2 18am in atlantic city so in other words it looks like a normal ride history report showing on the gps screenshot that i supposedly went from philly to ac so yes this driver apparently drove all the way there however i did not request this ride and i was never in this mans car ,3,Lyft

EagleKL44,yeah but it takes kirkman 12 months to release 12 issues usually the show could easily cover 12 issues in half a season so what i am saying is i like that they are keeping a distance from the comics and the show whereas got i read all of the books and now i am stuck watching the show for my fix because the writer wants to lolligag around the world on tours ,7,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,i honestly think the back half of season 7 is going to be alot of set up with probably some newly show only created conflict just to keep people interested the reason i say this is right now they have a comfortable buffer between the comic material and where the show is currently just look at what happened to got i would hate for the show writers to run out of material and have to start going off on their own or worse wrap up the show therefore i think the show knows they can set up all out war arc the latter part of this season and keep that healthy comic show buffer they have the mid season finale might contain guts and possibly the first episode back from the break might be rick showing some muscle aka c andrea sniper scene and then the rest of the season would be setting up aow ,13,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,good catch definitely the same place used for filming now in the show i do not think they are going to have the s04 07 episode link to this one although how cool would that be if they saw the drowned walker that the governor placed there right at the end of the dock ,4,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,i agree you do not have to show every zombie kill on screen but when you invest a solid 5 minutes of the show showing spencer randomly walk into the woods follow the sound of grunting find the tree perch walker go back to his car off screen to get the grapple hook hook the walker yank him down in a gruesome fashion you could easily have him knife the head and then loot the pockets the minute he approached the walker i was like oh they are gonna have dumbass spencer go out like a dumbass for not knifing the walker uh wait what sure then at that point i realized it was implied the walker was finally put down but that just bad writing imo,1,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,they serve a few purposes defensively if you think about it it harder for anyone to attack the sanctuary with a wall of chained up zombies essentially like a mine field sure you can make it through but the danger is all around you you cannot shoot them because you will alarm the saviors and you cant get up close because a savior guard will likely spot you more importantly though i think it used as an intimidation factor for anyone that does happen to stumble across the sanctuary it a extremely intimidating sight oh jeez do not wanna fuck with those guys they are crazy for using walkers like that on top of that negan uses it to remind his people of the constant danger of the world his whole motto is they offer protection and we have seen examples prison of survivors become soft after getting too comfortable it a constant reminder to those inside that the zombies exist finally negan uses this as a threat to his saviors you do not want to serve me alive fine then you can serve as a dead zombie protecting the walls that my perception at least ,25,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,very good point that definitely a plus to going to the poconos question though if a walker has slowed down or frozen to the point of inactivity during the winter if you are walking in knee deep snow and step on one would it become active enough to bite you ,3,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,possibly i would argue that if the saviors did find me i think i would likely get along with them just fine saviors want communities to provide for them one person alone cannot do that so i assume they would likely give me the option to join or die i could see myself buddy buddy with negan the key part here is staying hidden while still showing an intimidation factor i could post signs at a certain perimeter length where i do not want people getting to close to boobytraps everywhere think bamboo pits from vietnam maybe even create a fake mine field just so someone sees it and is like ehh not worth testing it if someone did get through and i recognized it was not worth the fight i could either bug out or see if they could reason with me its really just dumb luck not being found at that point makeshift barbed wire you cut off small pieces of wire and use pliers to wrap it around the wire to create the barb cut the metal on an edge to make it pointy i have seen it done before not hard but you need long spool of wire in order to do it ,-4,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,well at the beginning of the episode they wake up in the back of their supply truck on a run where they spent the night the truck is empty so it can be assumed they have not found anything yet looks like they were just following a road when they come across a gated back road that said something like nothing but trouble 4 you keep moving rick and aaron hop that fence and head off into the woods to only reappear later near a flat bed hooked up to a truck with some gas cans and overgrown weeds all around it and a large warning sign with a ton of words there is another post on this sub thread where someone breaks down what that board said and tl dr version was i have a bunch of guns rifles ak47 pistols etc and all my supplies are on the boat and i have protected them if you are reading this and not dead then that means i am dead feel free to take the supplies if you can the preview for next week looks like rick and aaron in a canoe navigating the walker infested water to reach the supplies boat ,3,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,east coast pa woot woot checking in the 1 thing that i hate around here are when boarder stop in the middle of the trail like speaking very literal they go halfway down the trail and then sit down in the smack dab center of the trail it never just 1 person either usually a group of 3 8 this causes most of the beginning skiers who use the middle to now be forced to ski more to the outside edges of the trail which causes me to have to check my speed and be wary of colliding with someone i primarily ski the edges since the snow piles up there from everyone skiing the middle i like to think of myself as the hero and i purposely dig my edges extra hard to attempt to spray some snow back to the middle i have 0 problems needing to stop but please stop off to the inside edge it the safest place to stop barring it being a blind spot that being said i have no problems with most snowboarders i gave it a shot when i was 18 after skiing my whole life lasted about 2 years and then broke my arm when i caught an edge and did the whole hey let me break my fall with my wrist switched back to skiing just because i was much better ,2,skiing
EagleKL44,hey man first off good luck and have fun i will be out there 2nd week weekend of january as well hitting breck keystone and possibly arapahoe if we can swing it pa skier here checking in i took a trip to park city ut last year with my buddies who live in co basically the biggest thing is the altitude last year i landed and the next day i was on the mountain at 10 000ft elevation it is gonna kick your ass especially if you have to hike anywhere like we were honestly i cannot stress to just take your time going down the mountain my first non groomer trail i nearly killed myself because i was completely gassed going through a steep glade nearly t boned a tree take your time going down make a few turns and catch your breath especially in deep thick pow this year i am heading out on a wednesday morning going to explore denver and boulder wednesday thursday and then ski friday sunday i am hoping to acclimate to the altitude those first 2 days maybe go for a run or two and get my lungs burning a little bit at that elevation hydration is key as well being 18 you should have no issue at that but for my anyone else reading this make sure you drink plenty of water finally try to get a few runs in on the east coast before you head out there do not want your first run of the season to be at 10k elevation with your quads and hamstrings burning due to lack of use ,2,skiing
EagleKL44,i disagree only because i would rather have 16 weeks of looking forward to new content then 10 weeks in both got and the walking dead i had already read all of the books comics i know the story and i know the major plots that are going to happen that being said i fully enjoy every episode to see what new material they add and how they develop the story i could see as someone who does not know what to expect how it might get slow but at the end of the day they are telling a story not every episode can be guns and killing ,1,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,yeah the reasoning for spencer getting out of the car stumbling into the woods until he heard the sound of a walker after the show i also thought well i guess it implied he wanted to vent some frustration still could have written it better maybe him and gabriel are searching the woods then have the conversation when gabe leaves him then spencer finds the tree walker would have at least had an excuse to be in the woods ,3,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,it serves many purposed i think the most important is intimidation it pretty intimidating to come across the sanctuary and see the walkers being chained up like that not only does one have to think what the hell is wrong with the people using walkers but also would provide an extra obstacle for any group that would want to attack the sanctuary gotta be pretty difficult to sneak past all those walkers also it a level of intimidation for the saviors as well not the bad ass ones working for negan but the normal living people in the compound it a daily reminder of how ruthless negan and his men can be he has mentioned a couple of times about daryl working for him alive or working for him dead chained up as in no matter what daryl will work for him i would say its an all around intimidation factor for both outside forces as well as a reminder to those inside the compound ,2,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,it also helps with filming allows the writers production crew etc etc more time then having to film the whole season in a short time frame in order to have 16 consecutive weeks of material as much as it sucks it generally the best thing for the show production wise ,5,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,the whole spencer walker thing was all around bad writing he had no reason to get out of the car and start heading towards the woods i rewatched that scene and theres next to no noise when he in the car to make him head that way once he in the woods you can definitely start to hear a walker i believe the tree perch walker was some sort of survivalist he had the note written in latin of where he his all his supplies my though is he was either up in that tree hunting or he was trying to escape some walkers and climbed up his perch already placed there for hunting possibly he was forced to remain up there for awhile due to the walkers possible herd he either remained up there so long that he succumbed to hunger or exposure dehydration he tied a rope around himself probably to avoid falling off the perch if he had become weakened state due now having spencer randomly use a grappling hook and not stabbing the walker in the head once it was on the ground is imo just bad writing ,12,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,were there any previews that show michonne meeting a lady on the road i do not believe i saw one where she encounters anyone other than walkers just wondering where the question came from in the spoilers above ,5,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,well not sure if you heard but s carl apparently does find a box of guns in the back of the truck but i agree it would be badass for him to have the rocket launcher i was also hoping jesus would say hey let make some molotov cocktails smash them in the truck and then jump out aka sabatoging the truck creating a diversion so they can get away now that they know where the sanctuary is how cool would it be if carl said ok jesus you jump first then stays in the truck and throws the molotov cocktails at the saviors once inside the compound ,1,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,well the truck that carl is in just left the hilltop community not asz and if you actually watch the episode you can see the truck they are loading the guns into at asz is not the same truck at the hilltop the hilltop has no guns or at least bullets for those guns so it would not make sense that the saviors had just taken them from the hilltop you could argue that these were reserve weapons in case they needed them at the hilltop and i guess you could make the point that the previous outpost had been taken out so they did not know what to expect at the hilltop but then they are dumb by not securing the box with a lock or something if they are not as dumb as the look then they would anticipate maybe someone jumping into the back of their truck and stealing their guns ,1,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,well i do think the show needed that cdc episode i had never read a comic before the first season so at that time my thought process was ok yeah the cities and army sent to them have been largely overrun but that has to be some form of government located in some remote bunker basement somewhere the cdc episode helped put into perspective that the dr jennner had been in contact with other facilities around the world but slowly those have gone offline through being abandoned by the workers or overrun by walkers for me at that time it helped me really grasp how truly fucked the world was while i do have my own theory that somewhere there is a community of former government workers who are doing exactly what asz is doing and will eventually cross paths with our group the old government is no longer intact ,10,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,thank you this comment is exactly what i have been trying to explain in other threads hell maybe negan was pissed off the pre oceanside community rebelled and said fuck it kill all the men hoping that would get the women and children in line to start producing for him again maybe he even learned a thing from that group which lead to negan realizing that taking out rick or that entire line up group would potentially cause the rest of asz to just run and hide i like to think that negan beyond allowing some leniency for not explaning the rules to rick yet wants to give each group every opportunity to provide for him until he has to take drastic measures before he considers them a lost cause library group ,3,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,true but they still set up bells and sirens to draw walkers away i did not see any formal fencing or anything of the sorts but if there is then they took the time to do that as well i mainly meant they prepped that area for them moving there never used the word build ,2,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,yes it is lazy writing oh look here a box of guns it would be more exciting writing if one of the saviors began unloading the truck and set down his rifle at which time carl surprises grabs the gun and starts shooting like in the comics and com on who would not want to see a molotov cocktail in the zombie apocalypse ,0,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,my take is that the oceanside community seems to have been there for sometime now in order to set up this new hidden community therefore if this time lapse as passed i am starting to think that the former community the women of oceanside were apart of may have been one of the first communities under negan the saviors it could also have been one of the first to try and revolt against them i can picture something along the lines of this happening saviors say give us 1 2 of everything pre oceanside colony says no and they go to war and or keep revolting after being given multiple chances to provide for him negan figures killing all the men is better than killing everyone as the women will still be able to provide this is probably his last resort attempt before killing everyone ,16,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,well i have been suggesting for 2 weeks now that carl gets ahold of a gun in the back of that truck kind of lazy writing if that the way it happens just finds a box of guns i was hoping something more along the lines like carl hiding in the back while a savior unloads the truck sets his rifle down for a second within reach of carl he grabs it and unloads a clip into nearby saviors he is then captured or ends up in negan presence also i was secretly hoping for molotov cocktails idk how it would work that carl knew how to make them but it would have been pretty freaking sweet for it to go down that way ,-13,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,i highly doubt it but it could be the reason i do not think it is is because michonne was outside the walls of alexandria while jesus was pouring the scotch immediately after entering the truck right outside the hilltop walls i just happen to think it some form of sweating that occurs when trucks run their ac or something not a car guy but i know we have all seen that happen ,3,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,i believe last time we see michonne she finds the burned mattresses in the beginning of this preview shes following some wet markings on the road the trucks the saviors had could have been leaking something leaving marks on the road which michonne is now following to find out where they are going back to outpost sanctuary ,3,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,agreed i also have a small theory that carl will get his hands on a gun something simple like him staying hidden towards the back of the truck a savior climbs into the truck and begins unloading the supplies but sets his rifle gun down first somewhere in the back of the truck carl grabs the gun and starts shooting that at least how i envision it playing out but probably wont the way the writers change everything ,1,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,i would argue that stereotyping soldiers like that is not fair they sign up and dedicate themselves to do a job they do not just go around the world aimlessly shooting and killing anyone they are sent to do a job when their government deems it necessary my brother did not want to go to afghanistan trust me none of us wanted him to go but circumstances and the powers that be determined he was one of the ones to go if you want to be fair then argue that the us government decides when to allocate resources to deal with problems that sometimes include fighting and killing enemies of the state do not blame the soldier blame the person putting the soldier in that position ,1,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,i would not use trained killers i am not a veteran but my father and brother are as well as multiple buddies i would think they would prefer skilled shooters or trained soldiers rather than the tag killers nonetheless who knows maybe the next major plot to come in the comics after the current war do not want to spoil if you are not aware of whats going on will be an encounter with some form ex army government established survivor group ,11,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,well actually in the comics it was not negan who said this after the main group found alexandria glenn and heath went on a supply run to d c where they witness another group scavenging they could tell this group was dangerous after they sacrificed their own man to walker in order to create a diversion glenn and heath stay hidden from this group but then when they fire up their motorcycles that scavenging group hear them and follows the sound that leads them to alexandria the leader approaches the gates and yells the little pig line nonetheless i am still glad they used the line for negan ,2,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,considering the show is pretty much based on the comics plot lines i agree that one would think the army would have more of a presence however even after saying that i think the show is doing this intentionally to show how f ed up this world really it think about it rick wakes up and his police station looks like it been abandoned for weeks he hears from morgan that the army told everyone to go to the city where they can be protected well we see barricades that were overran a freaking tank with a dead soldier inside it i believe this is hinting that they could not control the mass of walkers once everyone started turning next we get a brief scene where the governor finds a band of army personnel surviving after he rescues the man from the downed army chopper i you take a look at that scene they all look exhausted weary of the governor approaching probably because of what they have seen so far we also get various abandoned army camps like the one from the big lots episode w the chopper crashed on the roof i think instead of showing one huge plot line or flashbacks about the army we instead get a bunch of subtle hints of abandoned army camps do not forget when the governor comes back to take over martinez new group they have a guy there that said he was in the army at one of the bases which was overrun essentially the show has hinted that every effort the army or national guard made during the state of emergency failed there is also fear the walking dead and in the first season it mostly the downfall of the army national guard ,39,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,i agree with a few points you are making i do think the hilltop will fall half the characters will die the others will be scattered retreating think fall of the prison on tv maybe some will make it to the kingdom some will make it to alexandria and possibly 1 or 2 are shown to die on the road after retreating i am not really sure what to make of the kingdom there was that one character who questioned their new interim leader but it seems he shut that down pretty quickly i am thinking they will be attacked by a zombie hurd whisperer mix similar to the hilltop alexandria will 100 be attacked by the zombie horde because why else would andrea be in the sniper tower some people will die but i think andrea and rick make it somehow my guess is 1 of the 3 communities will remain and they make a last stand and figure out a way to defeat the zombie hurd and take out most of the whisperers if not all maybe beta escapes into the wild like the governor in the show and has to completely restart a new whisperer community i do think right after the whisperer war will come some sort of conflict with the sanctuary maybe seeing the communities damaged post war and with negan out of prison maybe they try to take over again which leads to another all out war i am slightly inclined to think negan would reject going back to pre all out war saviors status ohio will definitely come into play eventually living in the ne i always wondered what was happening with ohio pa nj ny area ,3,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,well eugene we know was somehow surviving and then we find him running through the streets i believe in texas being followed by walkers when he comes across abraham he begs for help and formulates his scientist persona i believe abraham at one point mentions he began protecting eugene and as they set out for their journey to washington they came across various pockets of survivors whom they recruited i know you mean you want to see how rosita was specifically surviving but she was definitely one of those smaller groups abraham convinced to join their quest ,6,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44, no gun but my thought is he may try to molotov cocktail the bottle of liquor another thought is that upon approaching the sanctuary jesus cant convince carl to jump out of the truck with him carl hides in the back and one of the saviors starts unloading the truck sets his gun down carl stabs him in the back grabs the gun and starts shooting up the place ,6,thewalkingdead
EagleKL44,the best way i can rationalize this is in the beginning all they know is that there is some sort of outbreak virus survivors have seen people with bites or scratches or just general death come back into a zombie i am pretty sure they all just assume that the blood of a walker or bite scratch leads to death the virus is not what kills the living it the infection rotting corpses carry a lot of infectious bacteria a bite to the hand would not kill you but the infection from rotting bacteria would easily lead to death obviously some bite to a critical mass area ie zombie rips out throat or guts would easily kill you either way ,3,thewalkingdead

EagleKL44,i used to work with one that was just absolutely a piece of garbage and a waste of space on this planet here is a list of the following things he would do that led me to treat him fairly with respect to downright despise 1 would ask to borrow money and promise to pay you back after his next paycheck eventually he would work his way from 10 to some large sum like 150 and then choose to never pay you back 2 lied to me once and asked for a ride home because of some emergency thought it was weird he just told me to drop him off at a random corner in brooklyn later found out thats where his dive bar is located for reference this was extremely out of my way home 3 would steal people lunches no one would ever catch him eating it but the remains would be found in the trash 4 would skip work well past his allowed sick personal vacation days like not even close he easily missed 50 days of work every year this would force me to sacrifice members of my team to cover the phones for him he was inside sales reps 5 would openly fart and burp and then say excuse me as nothing was wrong with that 6 would sing at his desk extremely annoying no matter how many times you asked for him to stop he would do it again 7 once had a sketchy car pull up and ask a fellow manager and i if he was inside and if we could send him out we acknowledged he was and declined their request later found out that was his bookie whom he owed alot of money too 8 he would walk into work at 8am and immediately begin eating food non stop until 5 30pm 8a disgusting foods he would eat 8am included canned tuna soup straight out of a campbell can cold non warmed up straight up bbq sauce or ketchup yes he would just eat it with a spoon cold spaghetti soggy cold fries the list could go on and on 9 supplies from the kitchen would go misses such as coffee k cups packs of plastic utensils and paper plates the soda machine was often broken because we suspected him of shaking it for free sodas anytime someone brought in food like bagels any leftovers at the end of the day would disappear 10 would clearly show up intoxicated or stinking like his spent all night coked up at a strip club 11 if you spoke with him face to face you needed to stand back 5 feet because random spit and food particles were always flying out of his mouth 12 would promise customers unrealistic expectations and would waive delivery fees from customers he developed a relationship with would go get drinks with even though he did not have the authority to do so i would usually get the backlash of outrage from the customer and then have to agree to uphold the promised terms 13 and for anyone that would ask if he was so shitty why did nt he get fired i worked in a very tight knit specialized industry welding and industrial supplies this employee was personally hired and trained by the owner and had been around for 10 years he knew every in and out when it came to our sales department every time we suspended him he would threaten to go to our competitors and spill everything and work for them yes he had offers too the owner would always say as shitty as he was we could not afford to lose him like that ,1,AskReddit

EagleKL44,well for one machado was involved in a attempted murder in venezuela several years ago when she was investigated she threatened the judge that she would murder him when asked by anderson cooper about that exact sequence of events her response was i am not a saint i have a past and everyone has a past when cooper followed up and asked if she admits she was involved in an attempted murder she was the driver of the car she stated the past is the past and i am not worried about it interpret that as you want i am sure you have a deep rooted ideology at this point but it clearly appears she was involved as she does not discredit those claims and if you are not sure the us cannot prosecute an attempted murder case that took place several years ago in a foreign country you nut do some research i was obviously talking about that now to answer how discrediting her would help trump first she is not some random woman as you state he has past history of business ties with her he bought the miss universe pageant along with nbc and the first year he owned it she was the winner shortly after her weight spiked from 118lbs to well over 150lbs many executives at nbc wanted to fire her as part of her contract from winning is to keep up her appearance however trump thought this would be a bad look he convinced the executives at nbc to let machado stay on as miss universe and under the condition she would begin to control her weight in a documented new press where he invited reporters to watch her work out he and the trainer state they would like her to be a healthy full woman the trainer says her goal for her body type is a healthy 125 130lbs keep in mind when she was going through the pageant on her own she herself starved herself to be 115 118 lbs sooooooo you are telling me trump is the person to blame for her eating disorders because this random woman as you claim is all over tv right now in hillary promoted commercials and tv show interviews claiming that trump called her fat miss piggy and led to her developing a eating disorder when fact checked last night by meghan kelly she asked alicia machado if trump was the reason for her eating disorders which alicia stated yes next kelly presents a new paper article that dates from 1997 before the whole trump and weight issue thing where she states shes been battling an on going eating disorder and has had body perceptions issues all her life deep breath here soooo once again the random person who is being used by hillary as part of a character and ad smearing campaign against trump is the same person who has publicly lied and been caught lying is a former reality tv star who had sex on camera see big brother venezuela yes she fucks some dude from the house and suddenly a new us citizen just days before hillary brings her up at the debate trump has everything to gain by discrediting this woman who had a business relationship with in the past that is not publicly dragging his name through the mud with lies and slander hillary is aiming to play the female and hispanic card against him it makes trump look terribly bad if a big if they were actually true however by discrediting this not so random woman he himself is gaining credibility while showing hillary will pull out every card in the book to make him look bad if true against trump he looks bad if he discredits machado hillary looks bad for using her as a poster child ,0,politics
EagleKL44,i have actually seen a few out there that i am surprised the msm has not tried to spin let me be completely clear here these are pictures of people a dt rally when they are just starting to file in and take their seats obviously they are selfies and other sorts of pictures with captions like got my seat donald trump rally insert place here just surprised no one has tried to spin those yet probably because they would be disproven by 1000 pictures of the same rally ,2,The_Donald
EagleKL44,i mean i am not trying to blame hillary for anything i am just stating in my personal opinion i think she made a slight blunder by bringing this woman up on a national debate and starring her in her commercials when this woman has a very very suspect past i am sure trump has spurned some people along the way hillary has done the same in her own but if you are going to pick a person to be the face of one of your agenda points hillary saying trump is a sexist and racist and playing the woman card then you probably should select someone with a better history than machado ,-1,politics
EagleKL44,i mean no i really do not want this to go away people all over the country are slowly starting to discredit machado please tell me you saw the meghan kelly interview where kelly reads off a quote from machado in 1997 98 and then machado says she clearly never said that and it was manipulated by the miss u company like what no you are an idiot you clearly said that back then by keeping this in the media every facts that comes out and discredits machado makes hilldawg look terrible and sways another undecided voter do us all a favor please keep spreading the word ,0,politics
EagleKL44,you can also type in alicia machado big brother and find her having sex on camera with another person in the house now you can claim this is purely staged for entertainment factors but nonetheless she looks like a slut oh and the naked photoshoot shes done do not think shes not getting paid for any of that shes just a gold digger and i am sure hillary is giving her a pretty penny and an american citizenship to play a mummer farce,-2,politics
EagleKL44,just curious have you ever read the news articles back from 97 98 at which time the business relationship between trump and machado was going on it public record that the miss universe executives wanted to fire her and promote the runner up trump and nbc owned 50 50 shares in the company and instead of firing her he convinces nbc to follow his idea to allow her to remain in her position under the contingency that she begins to control her weight she has publicly stated once again his is actual printed news papers back in 1997 98 that she has eating disorders and was so rail thin and fragile at the time of the competition due to lack of eating in order to appear thin on stage now she is coming out in the media stating that she never said those things and that it was all a fabricated lie by the miss u company while everyone is shaming trump for inviting reporters to watch a workout of machado did you ever see the video where he and a trainer are standing next to her in the gym and when the reporters ask alicia about her weight trump responds by jesting that the reporters should maybe hit the gym for once because they along with himself are much more overweight than she could ever be considered just curious if you have also see the video of her having anal sex for money or how about the child she had with a well known mexican drug cartel and how at that childs baptism she was showered in gifts from the cartel members now she in the mainstream media as a newly anointed us citizen very odd that she becomes a us citizen at the same time hillary just happens to find her and broadcast her story all over mainstream media i also find it rather odd that if trump treated the miss u women so poorly than why is it that several miss u contestants have come out and shown support for him through their twitter accounts facebook pages and when the mainstream media will report it through their websites as well see washington post if anything hillary should have done a better background check on this woman i am betting she same a quick opportunity to get in a quick jab during a debate and hoped to leave it at that but miss machado is a gold digger and now doing every interview for cash that she possibly can looks like a sure backfire to me ,-10,politics
EagleKL44,lol bro she did a porno trust me if you just type in google her name followed by porno there are a dozen adult sites that host the video yes shes also done several topless photo shoots and had sex on camera for the money ,-6,politics

EagleKL44,hey my sister is one of the latter she hates trump for her own misinformed reasons the points she tries to make sounds like it straight off biased cnn but disliked hillary as well and therefore has stated she is not voting my parents and i even asked why does not she look into the green part or libertarian she said it does not matter because no vote for trump is just as good as a vote for hillary just think about the thousands of people that are out there thinking this same thing dislike trump and do not favor hillary therefore wo not vote or will vote but for a non factor party meanwhile i see trump support in the form of signs stickers and ads 5x more than hillary ads it a movement ,3,politics
EagleKL44,feelings not hurt we hope you have a wonderful day as well when trump embarrasses she who will not be named tonight please make sure you create a safe space for yourself to enjoy a nice bowl of ice cream and have plenty of kleenex for your tears and sniffles hugs and kisses trump supporter ,7,politics
EagleKL44,eastern pa here checking in roughly 30 mins outside of philadelphia i have got to say between my area and my girlfriend area about an hour north of philly i would say i am not surprised every neighborhood i drive through i see trump signs or bumper stickers easily 5 1 over hillary signs a bunch of co workers were just talking in our break room and it was heavily pro trump only 1 person spoke up in favor of hillary and another just said she not really into politics but does not prefer him i realize pa has usually leaned dem but i gotta say people i see more pro trump than pro hillary i realize you can spin that however you wish but i can honestly say the feeling from what i am seeing is trump supporters happily and energetically supporting trump meanwhile hillary supporters appear to be in hiding and embarrassed to state their affiliation ,7,politics
EagleKL44,hilldawg is also supported by the saudi and other middle eastern factions difference is trump has denounces any white power organizations and has publicly stated he does not want their support hillary on the other hand welcomes her donations and was a huge advocate along with mr obama for the loosened sanctions on iran and constantly trying to hide gov t files that show the saudi helped fund the 9 11 attacks you want someone with track record of putting foreign sovereignty ahead of your own people vote hillary you want an improved economy vote trump ,4,politics

EagleKL44,not trying to sound spoiled rural player here i know and feel the struggle of nonstop pidgeys weedles and spearows yesterday while just randonly driving on a back road in between 2 farms this guy spawned and i nearly shit bricks my gf had my phone and was checking so when she said this big dinosaur guy just appeared i literally threw on my flashers pulled over and spent 3 great balls catching him i have no idea how or why it spawned in the middle of nowhere pa but maybe this is hope for all us rural players out there ,1,pokemongo
EagleKL44,not sure where you live i live in between a fairly large town in pa and the sticks mountains i noticed the other day if i was sitting at home and dropped an incense or lure there a park down the street from me i only ever got the same as you today i was driving through town on my way home and decided to stop and get gas i checked my tracker and saw a ton of more uncommon pokemon so i dropped the incense there parked my car and took a walk around the block literally got nothing but weedles and pidgeys then with 45 seconds left this guy popped up i thought i was seeing shit just keep grinding man its hard life for rural players ,2,pokemongo
EagleKL44,you still have 2x the amount that show up on my screen sigh ,1,pokemongo
EagleKL44,in land locked usa yes very rare not sure for people around large bodies of water though ,1,pokemongo
EagleKL44,i would say for every incense i roughly get 1 maybe on a rare occasion 2 eevees that show up and almost always they are under 100cp so not worth evolving typically when i droo an incense i get 1 2 caterpie weedles 2 pidgeys or maybe a spearow and usually 1 eevee sometimes add in 1 of the following drowzee ghastly rarely clefairy or nidoran ,1,pokemongo
EagleKL44,nope i would say my breakdown is like 60 2km 30 5km and 10 10km i hatched 1 10km that was a level 400 eevee which i evolved and powered up to my lvl 1087 jolten and currently aboit 1 mile from hatching my 2nd 10km egg keep grinding ,1,pokemongo

EagleKL44,not even kidding if i walk out the front doors of my building i could spit on the statue commemorating some past govenor of pa from the front doors i walk roughly 20 feet turn right towards my section and maybe another 20 30 feet is my cubicle so youre telling me if im 15 20 yards away im not close enough increase the proximity so i dont need to stand on too of things theres one of those circukar intersections near my work and a huge ww2 commemorative statue in the middle no benches no sidewalks people arent supposed to cross the 2 lane circle to get to it yet there is a gym there and the only way to get to it is to illegally cross a busy intersection and then stand on the edge of the street and fight ive seen numerous teenagers sprinting across the lanes to get to it also heard a cop parked around the corner the other day and yelled at anyone trying to make their way out to it like thats not fun for anyone increase the proximity so someone can safely access the gym from across the street ,1,pokemongo
EagleKL44,the yellow brick road leading to a legendary pokemon follow it ,2,pokemongo
EagleKL44,proximity is a huge issue for me half the stops are random momuments that you need to cross a busy 2 3 lane highway to get to when walking driving from stop to stop is technically an option bit then the whole legal issue with driving and playing also experienced a gym the other at this restaurant on my way home from my real life gym i park in the parking lot gym is not activated i get out of my car and walk to the door gym is still too far away now this particular restaurant closes after lunch on sundays i walked around to the front of the building still not close enough like how much more on top of this place do i need to be increase the proximity so when im within a stones throwing distance i say 50 yards the stops and gyms activate its ridiculous theres a stop out front of my workplace honestly 5 feet outside the front doors if im sitting at my desk i cannot collect if there were no walls i could literally spit on that fucking thing how is the proximity so shitty note gps is generally accurately showing where i am ,2,pokemongo
EagleKL44,honestly i see all these screen shots of people near lures with 3 4 pokemon showing up heck yesterday i saw a screenshot of someone in between 2 lured spots with a drowzee bellsprout multiple pidgeys weedles and a ghastly last night i was walking my dog in my town near the only spot that has 2 stops next to one another my town has 5 total but the 2 next to each other are a post office mason temple society and i met this young kids roughly 14 just sitting on the temple steps we both realized we were out searching so he dropped a lure and i drooped a lure for the next half hour i had roughly 2 pidgeys 1 2 weedles caterpies and a lvl 210 meowth that escaped after the first great ball i threw broke i believe the kid had same results but he did catch a horsea for the first time and i think a low level ghastly idk how i see all these screenshots of people near lures with dratinis squirtles staryus jigglypuffs haunters etc etc lures only ever bring me the basic polemon mentioned above ,1,pokemongo

EagleKL44,lol remove any walls and i could easily throw a rock baseball football 40 50 yards ,2,pokemongo
EagleKL44,working in a financial investment office it is a very professional atmosphere probably frowned upon is what im getting usually i grab the stop on my way in and out of work and also when i leave for lunch but nonetheless you are suggesting to not increase some user satisfaction based on a proximity issue im not saying someone should be able to look at the map and grab any gym stop that shows up but if i can throw a stone and hit the location of the stop then i should be able to interact with it as well ,2,pokemongo
EagleKL44,i completely agree with your agree lol living in the burbs is annoying the landmarks are like fountains in the middle of a circle intersection like you cannot physically walk up to it unless you jaywalk thru traffic and stand in front of it in the middle of a road that makes no sense let me grab the stop from 30 yards away safely across the street ,2,pokemongo
EagleKL44,i work in a city but i live in the boonies slang for wooded farmland secluded area when in driving or anywhere near work i find tons of pokemon but when im out near my house i barely find any occasionally if im walking my dog 1 or 2 weedles will pop up but majority of the time the tracker lists 5 9 pokemon and they are all 3 steps away and never appear ,1,pokemongo
EagleKL44,my issue is in my work complex theres a statue in the front of the building if im in my office no more then 50 yards away it doesnt work hell when im at the front door of the building it says im too far away i literally need to stand in front of the stop which is slightly embarrasing to do in front of 1000 other people who work at your company to do also probably frowned upon by management imo this game would be alot more enjoyable if i could grab the stop or gym without having to sit on the landmark itself literally need to be on top of everything for it to work maybe you libe somewhere where the stops are easier to get to but in eastern pa most of the stops are random places that you cannot actually stop at hell i saw a billboard the other day as a gym you cant stop there unless you pull over the side of the road ,6,pokemongo
EagleKL44,well show houses and book houses are significantly different example there is a willas tyrell in the books who was the yoinger brother of loras but he i believe was some sort of cripple but very capable of producing an heir as in the books the queen of thornes attenpted to marry sansa and willas if the books follow the show he would now be the rightful heir but going off the show i woukd also add these houses may not be the biggest houses but they played importabt roles rickard karstark house karstark beheaded by robb roose bolton house bolton killed by ramsay greatjon house umber killed at red wedding lady mormont house mormont killed at red wedding ,2,asoiaf
EagleKL44,well to be fair to my response you are asking why a certain something happened in the show version they have less time and therefore need somethings to be implied lord walder kept asking for black walder and lothar arya says they are here and then reveals the pie the show is then implying that at some point she crossed paths with the 2 sons killed them and cooked them for lord walder my best judgement would tell me that she stalked them and scouted them then likely put on a face and killed them who knows where she got the oven and materials to cook the actual pie but thats where your imagination needed to kick in thats my personal viewpoint of it but i can get where you would want more hard evidence ,3,asoiaf
EagleKL44,yes however if you look through the reactions and discussion threads this was largely overlooked i kept hearing the but why would they said to mereen and not just wait for dany to get to westeros question this post was to answer that ,1,asoiaf
EagleKL44,do not forget about the vale which is unofficially littlefingers army if sansa can play little robin to declare for dakingindanorf then the reamining northern forces vale army is going to be just as strong a danys invadeing army comboed with tyrells and dorne ,1,asoiaf
EagleKL44,i just think lancel is much smarter than he apoears to be and when he walks out of the sept he sees the little kid running away after it looked like he was spying on the people in the sept the writing was kind of poor for that specific scene they could have had like a group of kids run away which would have made it more suspicious leading to him following them ,2,asoiaf

EagleKL44,to answer your one question arya in the show and book was trained and practiced removing the faces of those who were to be added to the wall likely she gave the gift to whoever that person whos fave she was using as far as the frey pie i mean i getvwhere you are coming from but its a show man i would not look too much into it i like to think arya did he assassin scouting of her targets drew up a plan and executed it by killing and baking the 2 frey brothers then feeding it to their father walder frey ,1,asoiaf
EagleKL44,agreed going off of thise there is tech ically edric storm in the books who is a known bastard of king robert i forget exactly but i believe davos set him free and he paddled away in a row boat somewhere also gendry is a mostly unknown bastard of robert a few people did know but i dont think he ever fully figured ot out nonetheless they are not true baratheons since they are batards but they do have the blood of baratheon running through them if they ever become legitimized in the show or books ,1,asoiaf
EagleKL44,something to consider i believe the reason they sailed to mereen was because dany and her crew needed more ships multiple times this season they have eluded to dany not having enough ships to take her army to westeros she even discussed with tyrion after gaining the 100 ships from the iron fleet tyrion makes a facial expression as if ehh its not enough but it could work i just believe the conversation was had off screen with vary saying hey all her old ships were burned we need to sail to go get her army and bring it back so she can conquer the iron throne ,87,asoiaf

EagleKL44,what type of exercises if you are telling me you foam rolled on the same day you tried crossfit for the first time i am more inclined to say it from crossfit foam rolling loosely meant to act as a deep tissue massage when you use it before a workout it helps activate the muscles you target preparing them for a workout in simple terms when foam rolling after a workout you are releasing the built up tension acquired throughout a workout as well as the lactic acid built up this is often implemented to help prevent soreness of the muscles the next day ultimately i have never heard of someone receiving bruises or the rolling leading to an overly sore part of the body likely if you doing a new workout it could be those muscles were stressed in a way that left you extremely sore the next day ,2,Fitness
EagleKL44,where did you pick up this piece of knowledge from you can foam roll your lower back on day i dead lift i specifically make sure i target my hips lower back and upper glutes you should always keep your body supported when rolling out any part of your back but you can absolutely target those muscles ,2,Fitness
EagleKL44,bruised your back like you have an actual black and blue bruising mark from it foam rollers are used to activate your muscles and help return them to an elastic state often you are breaking up the built up lactic acid in your muscles if your are sore that is somewhat normal but if you are actually bruised i have no idea what you are doing to yourself other than you may gave extremely sensitive skin ,2,Fitness

EagleKL44,lol everything you just said could not be more false you are a hypocrite in the sense you want others to adjust their workout when they are using a machine while you yourself refuse to adjust your workout since the machine you need is in use i do 12 sets of squats because i squat until i fatigue my muscles it does not do shit for me if i stop at 5 6 7 etc usually 12 is the perfect amount of sets some weeks more some weeks less lol muscle and fitness just lol full reps and form is always 10x more important than weight idgaf about how much someone is pushing if they are not ass to grass or chin above the bar those reps do not count i would not classify myself as a power lifter nor a body builder i am just a dude that like to go into the gym lift and push myself and my body to new limits ,3,Fitness
EagleKL44,belts are helpful when you are going very heavy but if you can handle the weight without it i suggest not using one as it takes away from you locking your abs on the exercise example my max is 405 around 315 is when i start to use a belt well i know personally for me i began to increase my squat by incorporating some plyometrics if your gym has box jump boxes look up a youtube tutorial regarding box jumps make sure you squat all the way down and explode onto the box most videos will tell you to swing your arms but if you want raw power do not swing your arms keep them in front of you like on a wall sit also you can use a flat adjustable bench and place it in the squat rack line it up directly behind you so you can sit down on it safely next load up a moderate weight then smoothly squat down until your butt touches the bench basically at this point you will be sitting down on the bench with the bar on your traps then in one explosive motion stand up to beginning position complete 10 reps do this for maybe 3 sets a week on top of your normal squat routine also you can use strength and conditioning bands to do side steps squats basically put the elastic band around the outside of your legs around the ankles low shin then with your feet shoulder with apart take a step left or right bring the trailing leg over so you are back to standing position then complete a full deep squat do 10 paces to the left 10 paces to the right and cha cha real smooth with a squat in between every step if you can find a trustable spotter have them help you when you begin reaching your failing point like if your max is 265 for 5 reps ask them to spot you and tell them your max is 5 by yourself but say you wanna get to 7 after a few weeks i bet you will be doing 6 or 7 by yourself continue this until you hit 10 12 reps then move up in weight you will then be doing 2 3 reps again but with a spotter help you can keep getting stronger because they can help you get over the hump of those reps you normally would not be able to do on your own or without a spot stretching is big as well foam roll your hips to loosen them up and unleash their full potential hope this helps good luck ,1,Fitness

EagleKL44, second there no excuse for being so set on exercises that you cannot adjust on busy days if the squat rack is crowded and you want to do military presses then grab some dumbbells or go find the machine that replicates the movement or grab a bar and start the exercise off the ground each time regardless of how you do it the rest of the gym should not have to wait because you really like this exercise more than that one soooo in conclusion everyone else at the gym has to get out of your way and tailor their workout because you need this rack machine weight at that specific time lol dude you just sounded like the biggest hypocrite why cannot you adjust your routine no instead you are suggesting someone working hard has to stop their routine and tailor around you because you are pouting and want to use something when you want it for the record yes i am that guy that sits in the squat rack for 35 45 minutes because i am doing 12 sets of squats and maxing out at 405lbs people in your gym actually trying to work hard probably hate you for sitting there bitching about them under your breath if you really want to use a rack when someone else is using it ask nicely to work in with them most people will say yes but if you do not take that stick out of your ass i am sure they wont help out ,5,Fitness

EagleKL44, if you strip that bar and start a completely new exercise without offering it to the people waiting first why what if i am working on shoulder and i need to do 6 sets of shrugs and then 5 sets of standing military press just because you are standing there looking unhappy you have to wait does not mean i should stop after the first exercise and give you the rack in fact maybe because it crowded i had to originally wait 10 minutes to get this rack why would i walk away when i already have it only to return and have to wait again i know it sucks but from my experience if someone has the rack and they are using it purposefully no curls in the fucking squat rack and working hard then let it sucks but just wait until it your turn now if they are fucking around then approach them and tell them you are waiting and you do not appreciate them fucking around because it affecting you ,6,Fitness

EagleKL44,gym trainers are the worst at the retro fitness i belong to i have seen roughly 4 5 young 19 20 21yr olds go from gym bros to trainers because they figured out they could get a free membership and get paid to train people there about 10 total and i only know two 1 male 1 female that actually have a 4 year college degree sad thing is this one kid used to work out with his buddies he was by far the strongest of them all but was not overcoming his plateaus so one day he asked my buddy and i to spot him we gave him some pointers after 3 weeks we invited him to workout with us kid made some good progress then decided to become a retro fitness trainer goes through the joke of a thing they call certification and over the course of a year starts acting like more knowledgeable then us i stopped talking to him because whenever i do he critiques my form when he can or tells me about some new routine he was just certified in oh most of his routines with his clients go like this 1 girl pushups 2 donkey kicks 3 sit ups 4 tricep dips w way to much weight assitance 5 planks 6 rowing with bad form 7 more planks 8 lat pull down 10 planks on planks on planks i have not seen a single client gain meaningful results,5,Fitness
EagleKL44,they could easily use one of the fixed barbells my gym has ones that increase by 5lbs so 50 55 60 65 etc or use a easy curl bar and put as much weight on it as they wish but no i have to stand at the squat rack with a displeased look as some skinny 20yr old has 3 sets left bro curling 65lbs in the squat rack ,1,Fitness

EagleKL44,where in your back does it pull do you have a diagnosed condition or do you just feel your muscle pull randomly from time to time i had a similar with the right side of my neck my nerve would pinch when i was doing pull ups shrugs shoulder presses etc eventually one day a guy in the gym came up to me and said he was a sports injury therapist and he could not help but notice my posture was off apparently i guess i was sticking my neck forward when pressing and shrugging i would tilt my chin down to my chest this was causing the nerve in my neck to exposed pressure i worked hard to correct it and i barely have issues any more ,4,Fitness

EagleKL44,idk what orm is but yes drop set would be for example say your dumbbell shoulder press max is 80lb dumbbells for 1 5 reps lets also say a standard comfortable weight for you in 60lb dumbbells for 10 12 reps sets 1 to 3 do as many reps with the max weight as possible lets say you get 3 then immediately drop to the 60s and do as many as you can lets say 10 12reps now on the 4th set take the 60s and do as many as possible amap then drop to a lighter weight of 45 50lbs for amap then drop again to 30lbs amap then finish with 15 20lbs amap your shoulders will be on fire you will have completely fatigued the muscle ripping the muscle fibers which leads to muscle growth and strength ,1,Fitness
EagleKL44,i would have to disagree i do a routine somewhat similar to the op without going too in depth monday back day 6 7 exercises 60 pull ups bent over rows deadlifts t bar rows low row lat pulldowns 1 arm rows hyperextensions then i finish with 3 bicep exercises dumbell preacher curls hammer curls spider concentration curls and do some abs tuesday chest day w 4 tricep exercises to finish chest flat bench incline bench incline dumbbells chest buster overhead stretches cable flys triceps close grip skullcrusher cable rope cable reverse wednesday legs 10 mins stairstepper warm up 10 sets back squats 2 front squats 5 stiff leg deadlifts 3 4 sets leg press 3 sets calf raises on leg press 3 sets of 20 lunges or 10 each leg then seated calve raises thursday shoulder pull ups to warm up 5 sets standing military press superset with shrugs on the trap bar rear delt cables face pulls side delt dumbbell raises front delt dumbbell raises finish with arnolds although recently i have also finished with more rear delts to really kill them friday arms i personally go 1 bicep exercise then 1 tricep back and forth my own preference biceps chin ups dumbbell curls then superset 3 barbell curls 100 wide grip 80 normal 60 close it brutal do 10 reps drop the 100 do 10 reps drop the 80 repeat for the 60 wait 30 seconds then go back 60 80 100 then i finish with concentration or preacher curls triceps dips close grip bp skullcrushers 1 arm overhead presses cable pushdowns reverse grip pushdowns agree or disagree this has gotten me crazy results in the last couple months along with a good diet i have put on about 4 7lbs since thanksgiving ,0,Fitness
EagleKL44,so i am concluding that your overall goal is you want to slim down get a little more tone and get some strength back also your wrist hurts doing pushups but what about if you bench press shoulder press or use a barbell for curling overhead presses also i personally do not agree the low intensity weight high reps thing you can do drop sets which will let you go heavy and gain strength then drop to a lighter weight so you can really fatigue the muscle which is gonna raise your heart rate good thing build your muscle strength and endurance and help you get more tone with some more size ,1,Fitness
EagleKL44,was there 5 weeks ago after they got 14 inches of snow absolutely beautiful place make sure you hit the summit of mt nine nine 90 you can then hike up the ridge to the top straight ahead off the lift you should see people climbing a path its about a 5 min hike straight up kind of taxing but the views are breathtaking have fun ,2,skiing
EagleKL44,as everyone else has already suggested wear them around the house while cooking doing laundry or just stand in them skiers stance while watching tv if you have tried to break them in and let says after 3 4 times on the mountain the problem does not get better then i would suggest returning to the place you bought them and see if they can heat mold your boots very common practice and most boots can have this done nowadays they will heat the inside liner first then you place your foot in and the liner will mold to your foot if they find out its the outter shell that is the problem most times they can expand that as well so the inside liner has more room to spread out very common for people with wide feet ,3,skiing
EagleKL44,these were the exact pair of boots i got last year this is my second season using them and i feel i can probably get a solid 2 3 more years out of them solomon x pro 100 http www buckmans com ski ski boots mens ski boots salomon x pro 100 boots mens sal 378152 o4i 27464 aspx s 291 i cannot remember what i paid exactly for them i would guestimate between 300 400 ,1,skiing
EagleKL44,i am near the lehigh valley philly area as well i will say this buckman is always going to be slightly higher price wise but you are mainly paying for the service which theres is top notch second to none i got my boots at the beginning of last year during their fall pre season sale this is usually september or early october they discount all of the new models 15 20 the best thing about buckmans is the sales staff is experienced and they know exactly how to fit you for the right boot i got a nice pair of solomon and they are the most comfortable things in the world i can ski all day without an issue i advised my buddy to do the same as me which i am also advising you he went they fitted him for a boot then he tried to go cheap and buy the same boots online from a website distributor well when they came in he could not figure out why they felt so much different then in the store because in the store they were heat molding the boots to his foot the ones online were just not heated he had to take them in to buckmans explain he got them online instead and they gladly helped him out but charged him for the heat molding fee all in all i think he paid the same amount or more than just getting them from the store as far as end of the season it really hit or miss because it whatever is left over i am a bigger guy so i tend to find things like 2xl jackets and pants 2xl base layers now on the clearance rack but if you are a large xl or like a size 10 11 foot size i could see finding your size being an issue as those are more common for reference i used buckmans in whitehall pa my friend went to buckmans kop ,1,skiing

EagleKL44,honestly i had this issue with my left right for biceps triceps and shoulder presses my right side always seemed to bear the weight of the whole bar i began to focus on individual preacher curls while i always did more forces reps with my left side i did individual dumbbell skull crushes and dumbbell shoulder presses on top of two armed exercises as well like wide grip bicep curls close grip bench and over the course of 6 10 months i began to notice i did not need the additional reps now i can curl 50lb dumbbells each arm for the same amount of reps without worry i am no professional but that was my method to overcome the left arm deficiencies ,1,Fitness
EagleKL44,are you constantly doing biceps with the curl bar or dumbbells if you are using a curl bar with both arms at the same time your right side seems to be the dominant side and therefore carrying more of the load unconsciously best bet is to use dumbbells and really focus on using the left arm by itself and yes do more reps per set and maybe an overall extra set for that arm that being said your dominant side will always feel stronger and could be slightly bigger,1,Fitness
EagleKL44,i have similar issue and its constantly a struggle my best advice is watch your form and technique when doing these exercises i know one of the trainers i befriended at my gym told me i was over contracting when doing incline sit ups i was confused and apparently you can go too far forward which puts pressure on your lower back think more about contracting and actually squeezing the abdominal muscles for 10 solid reps versus forcing your body to do 30 reps where you are unconsciously straining your back to do more reps leg raises work really well for me if i have a pole to hold onto like in my gym i use the incline sit up bench but i flip around where my legs would normally lock into and i grab ahold of the handle there my legs are facing down toward the head rest and while i hold that handle i can complete my leg raises i think holding the handle takes pressure off my back ,1,Fitness
EagleKL44,dropset drop sets are seriously one of my favorite tips to incorporate for instance if you are doing seated dumbbell shoulder press and your max is 75lbs for 1 3 reps your standard is 60lbs for 10 12 reps then try this with a spotters help and after you are warmed up do you max weight for as many reps as possible immediately after you are done pick up the 60 and bang out as many reps as possible of this weight as well do this 3 times on the 4th set do your normal weight of 60 for 10 12 or more reps then immediately drop the weight to lets say 45lb dumbbells and do as many reps as you can with those then once again drop the weight again to 20 25lb dumbbells and again as many as possible they might look light but your shoulders will be burning afterwards i would only incorporate drop sets into 1 maybe 2 exercises per day routine otherwise you will overload the stress on that muscle group but drop sets are the best way to increase strength imo ,2,Fitness
EagleKL44,squatting 315 will always feel like 315 on your body it just becomes easier one week you are maxing out at 5 reps with a spotter next thing you know you are hitting 8 reps by yourself you just have to take your time and build up the body and strength to hit the weight you are trying to acheive always use a spotter ,1,Fitness
EagleKL44,my girlfriend knows the family apparently the victim is a skilled skier and some wreck less beginner took him out i saw another incident similar to this happen at my home mountain 2 weeks ago a inexperienced skier trying to bomb the hill couldnt stop as trails were merging and took out a snowboarder luckily both walked away but i skied down to the wreck and the snowboarder and his pals were about ready to beat the shit out of this guy knowing there was a ski patrol base at the bottom of that trail i followed the out of control skier to the bottom and promptly told the first ski patrol member what i had just saw they called him over and i went on my way not trying to be a tattle tail but those type of people need to have their passes revoked or at least need that to happen so they realize they can hurt someone when they are out of control ,17,skiing
EagleKL44,i live in this area of pa and i can confirm that ski snowboard thiefs are notorious around there blue mountain jack frost big boulder and bear creek have all done a great job in the last 3 4 years beefing up security all 3 now offer free ski checks essentially drop your ski off and they give you a numbered token your skis are safe as long as you do not lose the token or place it on your lunch table and walk away as they will steal those as well honestly i have not been to camelback in 2 years because last few times i encountered utterly incompetent beginning skiers very trashy negligent beginners that were on trails they do not belong camelback advertises very heavily to the nyc nj crowds and get all the new yooorka that bomb the hills with no care for human well being also i remember as a kid 97 98 my father ford taurus was broken into with a wire hanger and a slim jim yes that is a method believe it or not and my gameboy color was stolen bad memories my suggestions is stick to blue mountain or jack frost big boulder as both have security patrolling the parking lots recently installed dozens of cameras and they have the free ski and free ski bag checks literally takes 1 minute to hand the attendant your skis and get the token alternatively you can always bring your own ski lock and lock them yourself ,1,skiing
EagleKL44,i mean it really all about what are your goals i would not classify myself as a body builder either i am a big dude but i have no plans on competing i do it for pure satisfaction and health reasons i used to just do arms on my designated day however i began to see my shoulders back and chest expand while i felt my arms struggled behind in mass size strength was there so i began to incorporate biceps at the end of back day and triceps at the end of chest day in addition to my arms day you cannot go wrong throwing in a few arm exercises on a shoulder day just do not be doing bicep and triceps every other day remember to let them rest and repair that the only way muscle grows ,1,Fitness
EagleKL44,haha yes sorry i will edit that now ,1,Fitness
EagleKL44,i know just kidding around although i designate 1 specific day for biceps triceps every time i do back at the end i throw in 2 3 exercises for biceps same with chest day and triceps keep in mind while you are working your back muscles since they are pulling exercises you are consequently working biceps to some degree so when i finish back day i will throw in 3x12 dumbbell curls 3x12 hammer curls 3x12 spider curls or concentration curls for chest ticeps at the end of chest i will go back to flat bench and do 4x10 12 close grip bp 4x10 12 skull crushers then 3 4x12 tricep pushdowns with the rope then of course i have my regular arms day when i kill both of them good luck ,1,Fitness

EagleKL44,depends on your gym la retro fitness did not provide their own towels in my experience idk about planet fitness because i would be considered a lunk or whatever their term is for gym bros honestly you will probably look a little clueless and people will probably notice you looking a little lost but the good news is everyone knows they were the same when the first started no one signs up at a gym day one a knows what to do my best advice is research some workout plans and watch some youtube videos on the correct form if you can afford it hire a personal trainer and express your exact goals weight loss or gain lean muscle gain mass etc a normal week for me goes like this monday back exercises w 2 3 bicep exercises at the end tuesday chest exercises w 1 2 tricep specific exercises at the end then i do some ab exercises wednesday legs this is a big day for me lots of squats deadlifts and lunges i warm up with the stair stepper and end with the elliptical treadmill for 10 mins thurday arms or shoulders lets say shoulders for this purpose then i will finish with a series of 4 ab workouts i do friday since we did shoulders this day would be arms or biceps and triceps chin ups tricep dips to warm up then i do 2 heavy exercises for each for power and mass then a few lighter shaping exercises to specifically target and engage the muscles my cardio fluctuates depends on how much time i have as i just started my mba i always try to finish 1 2 days with 10 20 minutes of cardio on the stair stepper treadmill some weeks i do 3 4 but like it said depends on my mood for reference i am 25yr old 6 5 235 240lbs w 16 body fat as of last week ,2,Fitness
EagleKL44,i understand many people on here have a lot of negative things to say about chiropractors but let me share my own story please note i have no medical background so if you come back with a rebuttal of fancy medical terms good for you but you wo not change my opinion nor impress me in 2008 i had a skiing accident i am a very advanced skier as i had been raised up since i could walk to ski unfortunately i was on a difficult trail and a lady that had no business being on the trail was out of control and took me out from behind concussion torn right ac joint collar bone separation and had severe back pain which i thought was a deep bruise from where she hit me fast forward 1 year fully recovered and tried to get back on skis again beginning of the next season after just 2 times out i had incredible back pain nothing like i have ever felt before and i am only 19 at this point i go to the doctors and they tell me i pulled a muscle pain keeps continuing until one night i am at work bar backed in college and was changing a keg i felt a pop in my lower left back immediately went home and called the same doctor she told me i over worked that sore muscle and i just simply pulled it i have had pulled muscles before as i have been an athlete all my life and this was no muscle pull i went to see a back specialist who recommended i take an x ray and after the x ray was negative he proceeded to tell me it was a muscle pull muscle relaxers pain meds physical therapy and workers comp was my life for the next 3 months until i returned to work fast forward again to 2010 i am playing basketball and on a routine play i go up for the ball when i land i feel the same pop in my back since i was at college it was too hard for me to go home a professor i was close with suggest a back specialist to me after he saw me in pain in class one day the new back specialist asked me about my previous experience with this injury and immediately suggested i receive an mri especially after my bad accident 2 years prior he also commented how it was negligent for the previous doctor back specialist to not recommend this from the start the mri revealed i had had 2 herniated discs to the left at my l4 and l5 vertebrae lower back and bulging discs on my s1 and a slight bulge on my s2 vertebrae tailbone upon seeing the results the specialist prescribed me some anti inflammatory med pain killers and physical therapy he also suggested acupuncture well i began all the suggested treatment and after several months i had no better results and my back even popped again one morning when i was sick and had a coughing fit life was pretty miserable tbh i could not do anything physically active no gym no skiing no running it even hurt to walk to class the bulging discs would push on my sciatica nerve running down the left side basically the nerve was pinched from the dislocated discs in my lower back and tailbone and i could feel the pain running all the way down the backside of my left back down to my foot often i would walk to class and by the time i got there my left leg would be numb from the pain and i would be in near tears one day that same professor who suggested the second back specialist saw me in the halls and after telling her my back still hurt she suggested i see her chiropractor i was skeptical because of all the hateful bullshit everyone spoke of them similar to this thread but since my only other option was major surgery according to the specialists i said fuck it what can i lose i scheduled my first visit with the man who literally saved my life we will call him dr webber dr webber sat me down first for a little q a to gain a full knowledge of my medical history where i was feeling the pain what the pain felt like what would trigger it etc etc he began to explain to me exactly what techniques he was going to use how it was going to feel and why he was doing this his treatment sessions would be thorough first i would lay down on the table with the heating pad on the affected areas next he would spend about 5 10 mins stretching my whole body out from calfs to quads to hamstrings lower back and shoulders he would then proceed with the alignment adjustments cracking shit and more or less pop shit back into place yes it felt weird the first couple times and yes i was still skeptical but the way dr webber presented himself i felt like i was in good hands it took a few months 2 sessions a week but i began to feel 100 better i kept doing my physical therapy as dr webber suggested i keep going by winter the next year i was back on skis for the first time in 2 years and i was hitting the gym again feeling good about not being a fat ass anymore eventually time came time for me to graduate in 2013 and moved to nyc for my new job and left dr webber behind when i came to nyc i met a couple of chiropractors who were very unemotionally attached to their clients i came in and mentioned i was looking for a new chiro as i am new to the city pretty much all of them just wanted to get me in the table and work on me then collect my check i went through about 4 chiropractors note i only let 1 of them actually perform work on me as the others barely seemed to care before i found the guy i am at now he nice he did a through q a with me about my symptoms how physically active i am etc my injury was in 2008 by 2010 i could barely walk a half mile before the pain was too unbearable after starting my first chiropractor treatment in 2011 i was slowly able to correct my back pain issues now i am able to hit the gym every day 315 squats 405 dead lifts bent over rows etc play basketball go skiing basically anything i want from time to time i have a small little flare up in my lower back and sometimes my neck remember the collarbone injury in my shoulder i am positive that since i lift i have some strain there i put some ice on it go to the chiropractor the next day usually within 2 or 3 days the pinched nerve is gone and i am back at the gym or doing whatever it is i need to do obviously there are chiropractors out there that do not care about their patients or are not as knowledgeable as others the same can be said about regular doctors and specialists the first 2 doctors specialist i went to suggested my very serious injury was a minor muscle pull even after i mentioned it did not feel like a muscle even the last back specialist i saw who gave me the mri and found out about my herniated discs scoffed at me when i did a follow up check up and i said i was feeling much better after chiropractic work this is the same guy that suggested a 19 20 year old kid have major back surgery to correct the herniated discs his exact words were that stuff never works the surgery will definitely correct the issue i am sorry but if there is one stereotype i fully believe about medicine is that nothing is every 100 going to work chiropractic worked for me that not to say it will work for you or anyone else but i know every time i am at mine i always hear another patient ecstatic at how much better they are feeling tl dr i had a major skiing accident led to serious back pain several doctors misdiagnosed me and one even suggested major back surgery for a 19 20yr old kid college professor suggested chiropractor started seeing results within a few months i have never looked back and still continue to go once a week ,1,Fitness

EagleKL44,respect your opinion i know everyone enjoys different aspects of the game and i believe there are definitely some validity to your statement about the rogue system a few times my buddy and i were going up against a gang of purple or yellow npcs and i would use my sticky bomb or toss an incendiary grenade and some stupid player would go wandering into that path and it would blow up on them unintentionally considering both do a decent about of damage next thing you know we were branded rogue and high tailing it out of there asap since the other players in the area are now aware we are marked men i am not sure how they can fix that maybe increase the damage points done to another player before marked as rogue not sure but i have been on the the division sub and this argument has been suggested my main point for this thread was that destiny tried to be a interactive walk up on somebody and join them which you can do to some extent in patrol but the actual interaction just felt a lot more fun and unexpected as compared to destiny i would really like to see destiny 2 with better matchmaking team finder like i said in a previous post one time i was playing division and i helped a random guy by simply stumbling upon him subway morgue mission i helped him finish the mission then he popped on his mic and said hey thanks lets go hit the dz we then proceeded to go fully rogue all the time for about an hour did not matter who we came across we were looking to take them down it was one of the most fun hours i had playing the division all weekend and it simply happened because i walked up on him and we started chatting in destiny i seem to do that in patrol then the player gets on a sparrow and disappears or goes to orbit because they need to turn in that bounty i am sure bungie played the division extensively and some higher up in the company for sure is making sure destiny 2 developers are looking at how to implore some aspects of the division,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,so then choose not to read them this post is purely my opinion on how bungie should look to implement a more interactive experience the way ubi massive did with td more or less you are saying you are complacent with the way the game is there is nothing wrong with that but i personally would prefer destiny 2 to be more interactive where i can walk up on a random group and listen to their game chat if they have it turned on and choose to participate with them if i wish problem is when i am in patrol i see someone and can maybe wave to them but there is no way to interact with them other then stop my game go to ps menu and type out a message or invite them to a party both incredibly annoying and usually unsuccessful anyways if you just simply want status quo then maybe you should not read these posts food for thought ,0,DestinyTheGame

EagleKL44,kind of but the likely hood of you getting a last word is like 1 30 also once you actually get the last word from the legacy engram you will need to go to the exotic weapon kiosk and then spend your strange coins on the y2 version of the last word because the legacy engram will drop tlw y1 light level you could theoretically upgrade the y1 tlw though ,2,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44, begin rant destiny logic developer 1 hey we have this new social space called the reef would not it be cool to put xur there occasionally to attract more players there developer 2 my man that a great idea where are you thinking of putting him d1 i do not know dude there plenty of unused space in the reef because we totally cut a bunch of content from the game d2 hey do not we still have that small locked away room in the reef you know the one that was part of the original dtg cuts d1 omfg you are totally right let put xur behind that door in that tiny fucking room and totally piss everyone off by only opening the door when xur is there d2 you are such a genius i mean instead of just putting him out in an open accessible like we did on earth you just made xur so much more exclusive to get to by putting him behind a wall that only sometimes opens seriously wtf destiny how fucking dumb are you guys i get you wanted to put xur in the reef to attract players there but why the fuck did you need to put him behind a stupid fucking door in a stupid fucking tiny closet instead of putting him out in the open which frankly there a ton of places to do that in the reef since it is vastly under utilized you put him behind a glitched fucking door that prohibits players from reaching him just put him in the fucking middle of the god damn reef i do not care just make him accessible when i go to log on and spend the 300 fucking strange coins i have because that the only thing that fucking drops for me in crucible anymore i needed exotic shards not a fucking glitched out door i have to stare at and for the record i logged out logged in restarted my console twice does not matter every time xur is in the reef that door is glitched shut and i cannot reach him i can log out 100 times and it does not make a difference end rant begin possible ban for dropping the f bomb like 9 times ,-2,DestinyTheGame

EagleKL44,yeah ib day 1 was rough without an lfg i played 2 games as warm ups and lost both with a team of randoms then went off to do the golgoroth challenge came back to ib for those 4 games scored 2500 every game and was close to if not the match leader but lost all 4 games was fed up the way the teams of randoms were playing too many hanging back to defend a c but could never actually defend it i always found myself at b wondering where half my team was one guy in our last game i saw 6 7 times go straight for their spawn point he never even got it neutralized before they would get to him i was smh ,1,Fireteams
EagleKL44,no it does help if you wait to turn them in after friday only because it gives you a little more rep but overall no you will be fine just keep laying and grinding out the games maybe save your last 2 weekly bounties if completed for saturday or sunday ,2,DestinyTheGame

EagleKL44,well you were just in the group with me and left after 1 game ,1,Fireteams
EagleKL44,too i am a 306 hunter looking to get bounties done and play competitive,1,Fireteams
EagleKL44,personally i found the most competitive maps so far to be widows court and rusted lands scout pulse and hand cannons were fairly effective in their own respective way snipers were dominant in the fact that everyone used them but shotguns were still highly effective especially if you have 2 teammates laying suppressing sniper fire and the shotty could sneak up on the other team hard scoping personally the 2 maps i have not played too on and want to are shores of time and skyshock really wanna see how using sparrows could affect gameplay ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,yeah i never accept anyone from the tower unless its a message then i check them out and maybe join their party usually i only join up with friends or random people i find in fireteams but even then you find some snotty annoying kids comes with the territory i guess ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,negative it was not him hint these guys claimed to be from u of cincinnati ,2,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,amen seriously in the last week between the oryx challenge too and last night lost of light i have had horrendous luck with fireteams so many times over the weekend i would post saying i know exactly what to do just need an experienced group and would get an invite to a group claiming they knew the strategy within 3 or 4 attempts it was clear half of them had no idea they had to kill the opposite light eater knight or not leave the aura etc just frustrating to try to find a competent group of players sometimes but when you finally find a good group and fly through a raid hard mission you think to yourself why the hell did this take so long ,1,DestinyTheGame

EagleKL44,can there be a option to have it more plain like it is now and the revamped redesigned version reason is i can get away with looking at destiny reddit while i am at work because my excuse is it helps me with coding and my boss has no idea what reddit really is my boss really has no idea what i even do lol i am pretty certain someone goes walking by and the more colorful version is up on the screen they will start asking a lot more questions then they currently ask it looks great tbh and i would 100 use it at home but currently the off white background makes it look similar to a website where i am typing coding into just my opinion some sort of toggle would be perfect ,10,DestinyTheGame

EagleKL44,make sure you actually land the trick you attempt for example if you hit a large enough jump and try to do multiple backflips but then land on your head side not flat it will not count as a trick i found this out and would make sure i hit a large enough jump and only do 1 full flip then stabilize myself mid air so i landed flat usually a subtle ping sounds indicating you completed a trick ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,agreed bladedancer is just not powerful enough to warrant a build in pve it has some uses in pvp for revive purposes as well as blink shotgun if thats your style not mine even when i do feel like running bladedancer i usually pop my super kill 1 guardian maybe only to be taken out by his buddies in a heartbeat gg is fine imo except it should kill sunbreakers with 1 shot and i dislike the nerf to the exotic helmet reducing the time limit ns is great but they do need to increase the suppress speed when an arrow tethers an opponent during their super still so many times i tether an opposing bd or sc and they skate away before the suppress begins ,-3,DestinyTheGame

EagleKL44,i was honestly expecting this to be a video with me being on the other team the same thing happened in one of the games i was in last night everyone was in the room you were in or on top of b it was a melee shotgun party with 4 warlocks 1 hunter me and 1 hammerbro they downed us first our 1st warlocked self res then revived us now 3v3 again we downed them they self res and got a revive 3v2 in favor of us it was down to 1v1 when their other warlock revived than it was 3v1 so our 2nd warlock self res eventually it came down to the hammerbro and our 1 warlock with the hammerbro popping his super surprise surprise to win the round for them we won the match though ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,psn kylejames44 lvl 303 hunter nightstalker or golden gun if you prefer ,1,Fireteams
EagleKL44,really depends on your playing style i will use it sometimes in pvp because i like to keep my distance at times for example if another team is blink shotgunning i will use the boolean so i can get a couple crit shots in than switch to my shotgun for when they blink up next to me for me i prefer snipers it a fair alternative if the other team is rushing with shotguns i can keep my distance with the boolean but go toe to toe with them if they rush close since i have a shotgun option too i will use it in pve quite frequently depending on the level ,2,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,kylejames44 lvl 302 hunter,1,Fireteams
EagleKL44,i agree i cannot even begin to explain how many times last night the other team would capture b i would bee line my way to b to try to shut them down recapture to realize i am the only team member at that zone meanwhile i look at my radar the other team is about to swarm me and i see a c zone neutralized i die from the other team swarming b by the time i respawn b is under enemy control and a c is recaptured by the enemy team repeat process 10 more times in the game and you end up losing by 20k to 12 15k quit that specific group enter new control playlist same stupid guardians going for a c instead of b ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,the best thing to do is hold only two zones in the map and kill everyone else anyone trying to take the zones from you the zones in control are point multipliers for each kill you get so theoretically you are putting yourself at a disadvantage if you just try to get alot of kills because while you are running around getting 100pts for every kill with lets say a 2 k d ratio there a player on the other team getting 150 or 200 points with a 2 k d ratio you cannot expect every player on your team to out kill every player on the other team if you do it a clear mercy game good for you and more often than not its due to the fact that destiny players run around trying to get kills while the other team holds 2 zones no that is not the way to win in control if you see the other team holds a b and your team is only holding c then at that time you get your ass to b and capture the zone then sit back and wait for the other team to come rushing in to try to recapture ,0,DestinyTheGame

EagleKL44,i added you ,1,Fireteams
EagleKL44,honestly i am glad hawkmoon got nerfed i could not tell you how many times since ib started that i have been 2 shot or 2 shot crit and finished off by grenade splash damage from a hawkmoon i legit found myself thinking the other night man everyone using hawkmoon and succeeding with it felt overpowered i nearly felt compelled to pull mine out of the vault and force myself to use it just to keep up obviously that what bungie research found out and that why it got nerfed also hand cannons died for me once thorn poison range and tlw range got hit so hard it made them noncompetitive rip my thorn ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,secrets out goes home finds a whole crop of guys trying to snipe behind that tonight ,4,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,so you basically camped at the church and won because of it nothing wrong with that strategy to win i mean if i have the opportunity i am doing the same just for the w the ib rank however my issue with clash is the stagnant game play so far i have been experiencing every 1 3 game or so a team that just camps and holds down a certain strategic area if all 6 members are on board watching the entrances and each other backs creating orbs it becomes a slaughter trying to root them out and honestly good for them for communicating the way they do but it gets boring after you rush in take out 2 guys and the 3rd pops you than the guys you killed respawn in the same spot i like control better or someome suggested a rift or salvage ib that encourages constant movement yes obviously some people camp out a or c in control but b is always a constant focus and battle also takes some strategy to coordinate hitting the target with multiple members i do like that they tried clash although i think some of the bounties need tweaking but i have just experienced too many stagnant games where its frustrating i have even been on the winning side of a team saying lets hold c on exodus blue where we had 3 designated snipers 3 pulse auto rifles for enemies rushing in but it just wasnt as fun as running around trying to reach an objective like a zone or a rift ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,wut ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,it really more just a game of luck for this bounty one game in particular last night i had 15 kills but 11 assists k d ratio was 2 1 considering each kill is 100pts and an assist is 50pts based on strictly generic kills 15 kills 1 500 11 assists 550 total 2 050 i ended the match with 2 225 i was easily the best player on my team that specific game but got real unlucky with kills i am all for the team win but as luck would have it i felt like every time i shot an enemy one of my teammates would finish off for the kill moreover i was second on my team in points leader was just shy of 2 500 and the guy in 3rd had about 2 000 the clash point scale just does not leave enough room for more than 1 maybe 2 good players to get the bounty unless everything goes their way i did 10 games last night and most of my games would end like this me just shy of the 2500 mark or me hit the mark and we lose ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,i cannot upvote this enough seriously going into my games last night i looked at the weekly bounties and thought ok these were challenging but manageable next i came across the daily win a match with a score of 2 500 i thought to myself this number seems a little high my gut feeling was correct over a span of 10 games i managed to get over 2 500pts twice both a losing effort damn you saladin moreover i noticed that usually on any given match there was only 2 players that could reach 2 500 normally top score on each team would be in the range of 2 400 3 000 the rest of each teams scores would then range from 1 400 2 000 it just incredibly hard as the op mentioned to have 2 or more players score 2 500 especially when there are no capture bonuses like in control in control i could easily score 2 500 plus in 1 3 of the games a play in a day more if i am really on my game end rant ,1,DestinyTheGame

EagleKL44,alright so just a thought but last night i was playing and for the first time i noticed on the destination screen the following wording sequence right below the daily weekly nightfall shortcuts solar system milky way galaxy local group image for reference image http i kinja img com gawker media image upload s h4if9 av c scale fl progressive q 80 w 800 1435022694506078760 jpg now i get that it goes with the theme of this front page and obviously they list milky way because duh we are in the milky way galaxy but i could not help but start to look at the screen and think it starting to get fairly crowded theory possibly in the future destiny 2 they could add a toggle between two destination screens that would be the local group in the galaxy and possibly and outer group one that would include jupiter neptune uranus pluto possible other things like the place when the nine are from thoughts comments concerns ,2,DestinyTheGame

EagleKL44,understood i just found it odd that in the card the stated they were near cedes i assume the reef is basically composed throughout the asteroid belt which obviously means that its no surprise the awoken defense found them so easily but the card makes it seems like they are so far out that no retrieval is likely while during ttk we head all the way out to the rings of saturn without an issue idk i just found it odd ,3,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,grimoire card ghost fragment dead orbit can anyone explain this i spent all last night on a dead ghost hunt note i have been a day 1 just never cared to collect them before now and found the dead orbit ghost fragment the grimoire card speaks of a dead orbit ship traveling to the reef only to be tracked by the awoken and abandoning ship to some mysterious place i wont say the name any idea what this card means any real significance http destiny grimoire info card 108040 ,6,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,i ended up using a combo of the y1 ldr 5000 because that was my y1 crucible sniper love that thing i also used the extrasolar rr because it has a better rate of fire for certain maps like lets say thieve den where there is so much close combat i decided i must have a shotgun and went with the jingukogo d simply because the rate of fire whenever i used a shotgun i always used the shadowing technique with a sniper i would hang back wait to see a firefight start up and look down the scope to see if i can pick 1 or 2 guys off then move up and cover my teams rear so to speak just be careful if you hang back too far or for too long you may end up on the wrong side of a map shift with 2 or 3 enemies closing in on you ,1,DestinyTheGame
EagleKL44,honestly for me i tried control and rift as other redditors had suggested because of the aforementioned gathers of players in one general area but i have to disagree with the method mayhem clash proved to be the winner for me i was stuck between 20 40 playing control and rift when i decided to give mayhem a try the sheer amount of heavy special ammo available far outweighs any equip now un equip method for real i grinded the last 60 of this quest in about 2 hours with breaks for my own sanity on saturday best method i used was equip last word and treat it as close combat weapon not as close as a shotty get a good sniper you feel comfortable with even if its a y1 favorite of yours and hang back obviously some maps are better than others for sniping but let your team run forward and creep up behind them to provide support with a sniper when some player on the other team recognizing your sniping and trys to flank you pull out that tlw and wait for your time to fire off those rapid rounds weaken them with a well placed grenade and fire off some rapid tlw rounds always make sure you have teammates around you its a shitty thing to do sometimes but do not always be the first one through a doorway i often shadowed 1 or 2 teammates and when they got popped i would avenge them than backtrack to find another teammate to shadow and repeat ,1,DestinyTheGame
