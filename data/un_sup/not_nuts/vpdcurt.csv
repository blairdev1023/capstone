vpdcurt,you do not see patients in the office preoperatively you do not see them just prior to surgery in the hospital you do not round on them in the hospital while they are admitted and you do not see them in the office post operatively you do not have to speak to their loved ones if something goes wrong and explain what happened and apologize in some instances you do not lose sleep at night over bad outcomes regardless of if it was your fault or not you only see them asleep in the or covered in blue drapes you do not know their names what they look like their goals in life their fears their hopes nothing medicine surgery is so much more than the hardware you sell it is a human being we are dealing with here not statistics for your company ,3,surgery
vpdcurt,you do not do any cases you watch ,2,surgery
vpdcurt,and apparently takes pics and posts them on reddit ,3,surgery
vpdcurt,sounds nice in theory but does not pan out in reality a penetrating chest wound with loss of vital signs requires a resuscitative thoracotomy not gonna happen out in the field like this breathing without blood flow is not helpful you need blood flowing to distribute oxygen to the tissues treat for shock requires iv fluids and or massive transfusion protocol of blood products packed red blood cells fresh frozen plasma platelets again not gonna happen on this scenario that little rhyme is cute but at some point we need to be realistic ,81,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,this guy is a rep looking for karma it really inappropriate thank you for your insight ,3,surgery
vpdcurt,this post says is all so why speculate on the preoperative discussion that the surgeon had with the patient the post operative care that the patient received and the discharge planning for the patient it illogical and misleading and completely out of the scope of your practice ,11,surgery
vpdcurt,like you said you are not a doctor so why comment like one on reddit tramatic is not a word an attempt at being educational is one thing misleading and wrong is another ,20,surgery
vpdcurt,it hipaa not hippa although this may be hipaa compliant it may not be in compliance with more specific hospital institutional rules medicine is all about attention to details this post is not educational interesting maybe but not educational you are completely unaware of the conversation with the patient preoperatively and are therefore putting the surgeon and yourself at risk ,2,surgery
vpdcurt,if the surgery is done on monday they definitely wake the patient up that day unless there is a reason to keep them sedated and intubated for a few days sepsis cardiac or pulmonary issues no reason to keep anyone sedated for 2 days after surgery simply due to complexity or duration likely receives a pca patient controlled analgesia a button they can push with small dose narcotics for a few days prior to initiation of oral pain meds pills ,12,surgery
vpdcurt,it not the doctor permission that matters it is the patient permission and based primarily on informed consent obtained prior to the procedure by the physician it has nothing to do with your conversation with the surgeon it is also institution specific in terms of rules and regulations are you aware of the specifics of the discussion that was had between the patient and his or her physician the patient has the right to privacy not the physician ,5,surgery
vpdcurt,nice i got some yellow bird variety pack and aardvark in transit right now should get here tomorrow with prime how the lottie is it dominated by mustard if so i need some ,4,spicy
vpdcurt,cameras phones are allowed in or either scrub out and take it yourself have a nurse do it or put on an extra pair of gloves and take it yourself what you do with the pictures afterward is what matters it also depends on local rules regulations informed consent and is not taken lightly i would never post a pic like this on reddit or any other medium too risky i have seen many people get fired over much less most of it is prefaced with images video will be used for educational purposes if it present but that is a tough sell on reddit ,10,surgery

vpdcurt,agreed that why i said they would contact neurosurgery or genera surgery trauma if more remote most er physicians are afraid of their own shadow anyway they would not do a burr hole even with all of the imaging in the world you also cannot take a patient in extremis like his guy to the ct scanner that is medical malpractice it the worst place to be with an unstable patient ,5,watchpeopledie

vpdcurt,anyone that has seen done an lp knows this the op is misinformed there is an urgency here that relates to acute trauma not a simple case of elevated intracranial pressure ,2,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,yeah i am a surgeon i find it fascinating as well just trying to clear a few things up this guy in his current state is beyond mannitol hypertonic saline or radiographic imaging he needs intervention in the form of surgical decompression release the pressure caused by bleeding in his cranial vault if this guy were brought to the ct scanner the covering physician would be sued for medical malpractice and would definitely lose the case the person suggesting that is clearly not a physician ,7,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,this guy is dead if you bring him to the ct scanner check to see which pupil is blown and make a burr hole based on that no time for a ct scan imaging is obviously preferred if there is time but that is clearly not the case here this guy barely had time to have fluids poured all over his face ,19,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,an er doctor would call a neurosurgeon who would likely either perform a burr hole or craniotomy if this happened in a hospital outside of a hospital this guy a goner as evidenced above ,8,watchpeopledie

vpdcurt,gunshot wounds are generally always worse because energy that is dispersed can be quite damaging a gunshot to be intestine will likely destroy that segment of the bowel as well as blood vessels feeding it and any other surrounding tissue it really cool to see actually but those injuries require intestinal resection with anastomosis taking out the bad part and reconnecting two healthy ends whereas most stab wounds are nice cuts her can be repaired fairly easily without removal i have opened patients chests in the emergency department after a gunshot wound directly to the heart from close range can barely identified anything looks like a used chew toy for a rottweiler ,2,watchpeopledie

vpdcurt,the shoulder can be bad because of arteries that run in the axilla or armpit this is problematic because gaining proximal control access the vessel closer to where it originates can require opening the chest the back is bad because if the lungs the aorta and inferior vena cava both midline in front of spine and he kidneys underneath the lower portions of the rib cage can also get spleen and liver from the back if i were to get stabbed i would take either left lower or right lower quadrant on the anterior abdominal wall usually will be a small or large intestinal injury necessitating resection but hopefully that it getting stabbed sucks by getting shot is obviously much worse ,10,watchpeopledie

vpdcurt,crushed blood vessels are not sealed off i do not know why you think it is ok to just make stuff up i have dealt with many of these types of injuries in mangled extremities it is typically the smaller vessels that are damaged and therefore bleed albeit at a slower rate than the larger vessels ,4,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,not much he likely would not make it regardless ,1,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,sticking your fingers in the lac works in theory but not in real life direct pressure in a location that is proximal to be injury via hands or tourniquet is he best way until you are able to obtain better exposure in the or vessel injuries are rarely if ever perfect circles so sticking a finger in is difficult and can actually worsen the injury itself ,1,watchpeopledie

vpdcurt,i agree with your first point i do not see as much blood as i would expect coming from the radial ulnar arteries on the upper extremities it must be blending in with the dirt just before the beheading he is starting to look a bit pale so i am assuming the lack of robust bleeding is an illusion ,10,watchpeopledie

vpdcurt,true it nothing more than an assumption ,1,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,no proof here that she even dies could simply be a seizure and she may have received medical therapy shortly after the camera stopped rolling she was not deceased when the camera shut off i thought we were supposed to follow the forum rules ,2,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,someone in this thread specifically asked for a doctor they did not want the opinion of a garbage man that still lives with his parents and goes through their medicine cabinet routinely ,1,watchpeopledie

vpdcurt,and ps i am happily married i am not the one living in my parents basement going through their medicine cabinet ,1,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,so death from rape itself is as you put it far too common this suggests that you are making an evidence based statement which i and everyone else knows is false btw so what exactly is the incidence of death from rape alone since you are clearly the resident expert on this topic ,1,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,the simple fact that you believe i care what random people on reddit think of me goes to show just how delusional you are it really impressive interesting insight into your dysfunctional psyche i know that was not your intent but it is much appreciated really quite eye opening ,1,watchpeopledie
vpdcurt,not surprisingly you have completely missed the point i wo not hold it against you i am asking for it because you are currently spitting up nonsense and i am over this one it is difficult to put your erratic thoughts into a coherent argument of any kind again all nonsense why are you still talking a reminder at this time would be extremely helpful thanks in advance ,1,watchpeopledie
