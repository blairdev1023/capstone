LifeSnacks,i would wager that because breasts and women are so sexualized and taboo that when someone with substantial cleavage comes along everyone has to gape if you spend time around many topless women in a non sexual way it is suddenly less exciting european nude beaches are a good example source worked at a music festival and camped with a bunch of topless hippies afterwards,2,AskReddit

LifeSnacks,nice i love how closely s psittacina resemble darlingtonia,3,SavageGarden
LifeSnacks,i agree with other commenters soil looks dry and would benefit from having sand perlite mixed in there also when did you last repot them if it was very recently they could be overcoming a bit of shock as well as the previously mentioned issues ,3,SavageGarden
LifeSnacks,i am with syntaximus on this one,1,whatsthisplant
LifeSnacks,definitely something in the lamiaceae family mint family but tough to get the species because it looks like that flower has aborted possibly bee balm break off a leaf and rub it between your fingers a description of the smell will help narrow it down ,2,whatsthisplant
LifeSnacks,i should have said wild morning glory or looked up the latin name we are talking about the same plant though calystegia sepium as uc235 said i agree though remove it i hate this plant it takes over everything,2,whatsthisplant

LifeSnacks,welcome your vft looks nice congrats there are tips on the sidebar like ping said and yes it difficult to determine the variety cultivar unless there was a tag you should probably just name it yourself something like audrey ii or the flynnihilator ,1,SavageGarden
LifeSnacks,i have only had this on a d capensis flower years ago i read it can be due to stress hormonal things but if you have one that readily produces a flower like that i would look into registering it as a cultivar could be worth some really nice royalties i know i would want one for my collection ,1,SavageGarden
LifeSnacks,i had a d capensis with a mushroom just like that growing out of the base a few years ago maybe it some sort of symbiotic relationship or maybe it a species that lives in moss ,1,SavageGarden
LifeSnacks,well i have only made a few bogs but i can answer a couple of your questions you do not need to put rocks sand etc at the very bottom to let water move through this will usually just waste space and raise the water table of the pot this is a very common myth in the world of gardening imagine a sponge sitting on top of rocks the sponge will still hold the same amount of water regardless of what it sits on because the porosity of the two materials are drastically different and water does not like to leave the higher porosity material in favour of the lower porosity notable exceptions would be lava rock or those weird clay ball things that are very porous sarracenia do not mind being absolutely soaked and i have never worried too much about drainage what you could do is put a drainage hole on the side rather than the bottom this ensures that there is water at the bottom for the sarrs but not drowning it to the point of suffocation but again i would not think this is super necessary especially if you are paying attention to how much you water them what mix is the soil that you picked up generally it will list ingredients on it such as sphagnum moss perlite vermiculite etc i personally would not add bark because it might decompose over time and provide nutrients damaging the plants 33 66 of 50 50 of sphagnum moss and sand is good sand increases drainage because it is not very porous and has low water holding capacity adding sand prevents anaerobic conditions roots need oxygen to grow anaerobic conditions also favour root disease the height sounds good to me again imagine soil is a sponge if the sponge is full of water laying on the largest widest side it can hold more water than if it is standing up on it thinner side because you have a pot that much wider than it is tall it will definitely spread out and capillary action will spread it throughout the pot lastly do not be afraid to experiment carnivorous plants are not as delicate or weak as hobbyists make it sound sometimes your setup sounds good to me good luck with the bog ,7,SavageGarden

LifeSnacks,my dog screams for sticks if you throw them in the water not a normal dog noise but a high pitched scream then she will start gurgling in the water screaming and gurgling and it sounds awful once we were camping near a lake multiple people came running from the camp site to see who was drowning we do not throw sticks for her in water any more ,5,AskReddit
