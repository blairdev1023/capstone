Sebiscuits,that ignoring the independents that the dnc lost after dws rigged the primaries do they think bernie would have somehow had a defense against bullshit baseless allegations there is no defense against lies and a population that believes them it would have helped if clinton was not faux left and could answer some questions with honesty instead of the typical political bullshit we get from every career politician looking back in the election it incredibly clear that it was her election to lose and she lost it bernie would not have given dump and his campaign the ammunition that they needed to take down clinton so i feel comfortable saying that he would have easily won like she should have i am sure some emails could have been dug up but it would have been nothing compared to what clintons scandal turned into ,2,esist
Sebiscuits,just because some regions wo not experience a huge change in their climate does not mean anecdotal evidence is not important the fact that people are experiencing a noticeable change in weather patterns from when they are children is evidence of climate change i agree that one year is not but personally for me growing up and living in the midwest i can see how weather patterns have changed since my childhood it not just temperature either it everything the the way that storms blow in the way frequency intensity the time of year that certain types of weather occurs the shear lack of winters compared to what they used to be i understand the argument that anecdotal evidence is not fact and agree that it should not be taken as such but to disregard people first hand personal experience is ignoring evidence ,1,esist
Sebiscuits,i think the fact that people can notice the difference in weather patterns between now and their childhood is important even if anecdotal the big problems such as the effect of cc on deep ocean currents are not as noticeable to the average person but when people can see the climate changing in their own personal experiences it becomes a much more real and immediate threat something that even cc deniers can experience first hand is exactly what is needed to finally convince everybody that this is an existential threat to humanity ,18,esist
Sebiscuits, climate change is not even a danger to us just because of our geography who do you think all these third world countries are going to be looking to come to when 80 of the worlds population is displaced because of climate change it wo not only be the us but that kind of mass migration will literally change the geopolitical structure of the entire world whither or not the us survives in any meaningful way is debatable but i sure as fuck do not want to be dealing with that situation for the rest of my lifetime ,3,worldnews
Sebiscuits,holy shit i have said this three times now its because they are developing countries they do not have the resources to do it on their own so in the interests of our own national security we are going to help them reduce their emissions if the choice for those countries is either a reduce your emissions while also stagnating the development of your country by spending more than they have to on energy or b do not stagnate your growth and continue using fossil fuels which do you think all those developing countries would choose ,2,Futurology
Sebiscuits,i feel like i am talking to a wall here why do we need to fund the development of other countries again you said those developing countries are 65 of global emissions why would a developing country which does not have much resources because its developing use extra resources on renewables when they could use fossil fuels which are much cheaper you want to use the money here at home which is fine in theory but realistically especially with trump as president the government would not spend it on green energy and if we did do it here and cut our emissions down to 0 those developing countries would still be pumping out that their current level of emissions if that the case the planet would still be fucked so no spending that money here would not be a win win and i am not convinced you understand climate change very well you compare us to china but we are not a developing country we are in fact developed and therefore should have the means to switch to renewables relatively easily china is still developing into a industrialized post industrial country they are still in the process of modernizing where as we are already supposed to be the two are not the same and that why the contributions are not the same the us has historically contributed more than any country to climate change and should therefore do the most about it how does that not make sense i agree with morelike it just virtue signaling and a way for the us to influence the world and ignore it own problems what problems specifically are we ignoring with the pa because by pulling out of it we would not just be ignoring the biggest threat to american security which climate change absolutely is what else has the potential to destabilize the entire world we would be ignoring the biggest threat to humanity whether you believe it or not climate change is an american problem we are obligated to do something about it what it seems like you want to do is just ignore it and wait for the rest of the world to do something about it which would just leave us behind we are supposed to be a world leading country but trump refuses to act like one,2,Futurology
Sebiscuits,just above you said that 65 of global emissions come from third world countries these countries are largely pre industrial countries in the past countries like us britain and china have used cheap high pollution resources for the energy needed to move into a post industrial society the money the us is giving is the incentive these small countries need to skip the cheap fossil fuels and move onto renewables to develop their countries the reason we do not have control over how that money is used not sure of the specifics but there are stipulations how it to be used is because the us is not an empire and these are sovereign nations these are also the countries that will be hardest hit by climate change which again the us is largely responsible for and at the very least the us owes something to them and the rest of the world for it also when it comes to climate change there is no good deal to be made we are long past having a good outcome both economically and physically it going to take a lot of money to fix it and if the gop or anyone else in government does not want to pay for it they should have done something about it 30 years ago but now we have no choice ,3,Futurology
Sebiscuits,how do you think that will start by developing better alternatives 360 billion can do a lot for that then transferring over to them you cannot expect china to just stop all development until they are all renewable that unreasonable they are not asking us to do that why would we ask them and no we are not going to end climate change soon that statement makes me think you do not actually understand climate change it not going to stop it already happening even if we cut all global emissions out today the climate would still change for the worse for decades ,6,Futurology
Sebiscuits,how is the us footing the bill we have contributed far more to climate change than any other country throughout our history it is more our responsibility than any other countries to do something about it not every international agreement needs to be a great business deal climate change is going to take power and resources to fix something those third world countries do not have but we as the greatest nation on earth are supposed to have what would your solution be to have no international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and leave it to each country to decided how to fight it i am sure that will work fantastic that a much better way to get everyone to actually try and do something about it ,11,Futurology
Sebiscuits,i would say a 360 billion dollar investment in renewables is a pretty concrete plan to reduce emissions ,24,Futurology

Sebiscuits,http pnhp org blog 2014 03 17 42000 canadians come to the united states for care really each year the fraser institute of canada issues a report claiming that over 40 000 patients leave canada for medical care yet a highly credible study done over a decade ago revealed that many of these supposed patients were merely phantoms in the snow and that this is another zombie idea that on logic or evidence is intellectually dead but can never be laid to rest because the concept is useful to some powerful interests so it is important to understand the source of the fraser numbers warning the following is wonkish as part of their annual survey of specialists to determine waiting times in canada the fraser institute asks the following question the last question of their survey 12 approximately what percentage of your patients received non emergency medical treatment in the past 12 months in another province outside of canada then within each of twelve specialties in each of the ten provinces they average the percent of patients who reportedly obtain care outside of canada as estimated by the practitioners of those specialities if you look at table 11 in any of the waiting your turn reports listed above choose 2013 as the latest example you will see that this creates a grid of 120 percentages averages are obtained for each province bottom line and for each specialty column on the right these are then averaged to get the final percentage for all of canada 0 9 for 2013 stop here and think about that each practitioner was asked to estimate a percentage of his or her patients who left canada for care not specifically for care in the united states as canada has a very large immigrant population about one fifth were born outside of canada if they had been asked for specific numbers each may have been able to make a fairly reasonable guesstimate but they were asked for a percentage if there were not very many then the lowest full integer might come to mind one percent oh it can t be more than one percent in fact 37 of the 120 sections of the grid reported zero percentages of patients leaving the country for care probably a more realistic assessment since those specialists likely couldn t remember any patients who left nevertheless the majority estimated percentages well below one percent ie there weren t very many but look at table 11 for 2013 there is quite a wide variation in the 120 results listed for 2013 that ranged from 0 0 the most common response to 5 0 the responses of 1 0 and higher were the outliers with the outliers it is difficult to imagine why a given specialty in a given province would have such a high number of patients leaving the country for health care when we hear about delays in care in canada the most common one is orthopedics joint replacement etc yet in all of canada orthopedics is listed at 0 7 below the 0 9 average for all specialties combined it is suspicious that some physicians intentionally or unintentionally may be making high estimates which would skew the numbers upwards let s look at table 11 for 2011 and 2012 as well as 2013 urology in british columbia was 1 3 in 2011 2 0 in 2012 and 3 8 in 2013 plastic surgery in british columbia was 7 8 1 3 and 0 4 in those same years cardiovascular survey in new brunswick was 0 0 3 0 and 0 5 internal medicine in manitoba was 3 4 0 5 and 0 3 radiation oncology in new brunswick was 0 5 7 0 and zero obviously there is a large scatter in the high outliers that changes from year to year further the entire population of specialists surveyed in 2013 totaled only 2 160 physicians scattered amongst 120 categories in the grid it is quite obvious that only a few individual outliers who either guessed high or wanted to make a political point were able to skew the percentages upward eliminating the outliers likely would reduce the net percentage in half and maybe more for the next step the fraser institute combined these percentages with the number of procedures performed in each province and in each medical specialty to give an estimate of the number of canadians who actually received treatment outside the country the results are in table 1 of each of the three reports leaving canada for medical care if their percentages were correct which they likely are not and the tally of the procedures were correct uncertain then this calculation might give a very rough approximation of the number of procedures performed outside of canada for each of the 120 categories of the grid but talk about soft numbers they then add a residual number of procedures for which people are waiting to estimate this residual number the number of non emergency operations not contained in the survey that are done in each province annually must be used using cihi and other data which they pro rated this residual for 2012 was 18 265 of the 42 173 total estimated to have exited canada for health care it s a convenient number to boost the figures even if they are operations not contained in the survey talk about phantoms in the snow this data is almost useless for estimating the number of canadians who leave canada for health care much less whether or not they received it in the united states more importantly the premise of those who use these unreliable numbers of patients exiting canada for care is that single payer financing results in excessive queues which then triggers this exit that should not necessarily follow since queues can be tamed if the stewards of the system are attentive to system capacity and queue management many nations with comprehensive systems do not have problems with queues in contrast in the united states the financial barriers to care that do not exist in canada are so great that tens of millions who need care do not even gain a place in the queue rationing based on ability to pay only a fool would recommend our callous system over canada s egalitarian single payer system for those who read this far it might be worth your time to look at one more item the waiting your turn reports are the same reports that are used each year to claim that canadians have intolerable delays in accessing their health care for the 2013 waiting your turn report look at chart 6 on page 10 except for plastic surgery orthopedics and internal medicine not primary care the actual median time between an appointment with a specialist and treatment is quite close to the median time that the specialists deemed to be a reasonable wait and where there are problems they are working on it more reliable data on wait times in canada is available through the canadian institute for health information fantastic research there and while you want to get qualitative about our healthcare compared to the rest of the industrialized world you should look into the actual numbers your self http longtermscorecard org media files publications fund report 2007 may mirror mirror on the wall an international update on the comparative performance of american healt 1027 davis mirror mirror international update v2 pdf this examination provides evidence of deficiencies in terms of the quality of care in the america health system as reflected by patients and physicians experiences although the america spends more on health care than any other country and has the highest rate of specialist physicians per capita survey findings indicate that from the patients perspective the quality of american health care is less than optimal the nation s substantial investment in health care is not yielding returns in terms of public satisfaction with the health care system even compared to canadian national health care which is the worst form of national health care the us has shit care there

Sebiscuits,r d already has yielded results though and solar is still consistently improving but again no ones saying it would be strictly solar just because it alone wo not meet the worlds energy demands now does not mean it a dead end or that it wo not in the future remember when natural gas could not meet our energy demands before it replaced coal the sun is effectively and endless source of energy and we should be trying to capture that energy in all its forms to stick with investing in fossil fuels at this point is incredibly short sighted from both a economic and environmental view ,1,UpliftingNews
Sebiscuits,it is a straw man because you are the one who brought up solar just so you could use it as an argument against me why do you say solar is a dead end battery technology is having a huge boom now which is the biggest hurdle china investing into infrastructure is not the same as investing in research and development ,1,UpliftingNews
Sebiscuits,seems like all our problems are a side effect of capitalism running a government like a business does not work because there is more to politics than just the economy business are profit driven arguably the us is too but government is supposed to benefit all of its citizens so you cannot just be concerned about economics there a lot more they are responsible for ,1,worldnews
Sebiscuits,they are an organ to humanity now like horses were a century ago guess what that been replaced too the quality of life will drastically improve when we stop using fossile fuels the direct effects on our health alone from fossil fuel pollution is far more damaging than anything you are the one that saying solar too there other forms of renewable energy no one is saying that we should stop using them tomorrow that a fine straw man though what we should be doing is investing our time and tax money into the renewable energy industry and not the dead coal industry and oil industry that will soon peak before declining you want to be world leaders this is where you will want to lead the world the rest of the world is ready for renewables that a massive industry with thousands of jobs that we are just handing over to china who investing 361 billion into renewables http www reuters com article us china energy renewables iduskbn14p06p,1,UpliftingNews
Sebiscuits,why do you say they have not shown concern and what do you mean by fucking with them and whatever you mean by negotiating i am assuming this is all referring to trump to some extent politics is not business and they do not function the same way to even compare the two shows a lack of understanding of politics works ,2,worldnews
Sebiscuits,no that not what i said at all first of all the comparison was between china and russia not our strategic allies our history with britain japan and canada not to mention the geography are entirely different than our history with russia or china and secondly it pretty fucking obvious that we are going to be friendly with our largest trade partner it would be bad for business not to be ,3,worldnews
Sebiscuits,all you gotta do is look at the money china is our largest trading partner https ustr gov countries regions china mongolia taiwan peoples republic china last year 2015 was not particularly favorable for trade between russia and the america our overall 2015 turnover was 21 billion a decline of 27 9 percent said a senior russian official in april 2016 167 https en m wikipedia org wiki russia united states relations economic ties so yeah the us is friendlier with china than russia ,2,worldnews
Sebiscuits,see that comparison does not work because you are comparing fossil fuels to organs the world could very easily live and thrive without people using fossil fuels if you get a kidney removed you certainly wo not be thriving and probably wo not live as long are you so dependent on fossil fuels that you can honestly say they are as important to you as your organs are ,1,UpliftingNews

Sebiscuits,the argument that because the us has done it to other countries then why is it wrong for it to happen to us is fucking stupid why would you not be concerned about that too i agree us foreign policy has been fucked up for a long time but are you honestly not concerned about the country that you live in probably being manipulated by another country look at what happens when we interfere so if someone is doing it to us would not you want to stop that from happening if the cia has this technology i am positive others do too but do you think wikileaks has the resources to be hacking into the cia absolutely not so it came from a third party is it that big of a stretch to think that russia a country that has both the resources and the motivation to hack the cia supplied the info to wikileaks because to me it seems like an easy way for russia to spread this info to the american people without directly being connected to it and if you do not believe that i would like to hear some other theories about how this happened ,2,WikiLeaks

Sebiscuits,i am just saying you have gotta at least give him one year after to actually be able to see what he can do and no the sanctions did not entirely block it but it absolutely made it much harder what is he supposed to sell them on the loss of 2 scholarships not being able to go to the tourney until this year restrictions on contact during recruitment between coaches and players this combined with the less then flattering image mu has had since last year and it not hard to understand why our team has so little talent ,1,mizzou
Sebiscuits,nothing about what mizzou has gone through is just college athletics breaking the rules and getting punished is not supposed to be a part of basketball rebuilding your program from scratch is not part of college basketball everyone that been criticizing ka has still not told me how he was supposed to get any talent in during these sanctions we are finally over them and now we are going to have enough and tell him his performance which you cannot really see during sanctions was not good enough ,1,mizzou
Sebiscuits,what is wrong with an american company supporting american heroes you seem pretty proud of russia achievements why do not you go live there and be a part of it ,4,The_Donald
Sebiscuits,yeah it really great having that happen players love having the system changed after they have committed to playing for a coach and the game he plays that really what players are looking for when being recruited and it awesome for the fans too continually seeing a coach try to build his own team while waiting for the former coaches players to get out is great personally i love it when my teams never take the time to flesh out a plan i do not have the attention span to watch unless drastic changes are made every few seasons ,1,mizzou
Sebiscuits,losing players and not being able to recruit could just as easily be attributed to our sanctions that we are just getting off who wants to come to a school that cannot play in tourneys or that the coach can hardly talk to tell me how in the fuck is he supposed to convince any top recruits to come here with this shit restitution and withholding from competition for impermissible benefits received by student athletes jakeenan gant was suspended for the first nine games of the 2014 15 season the other players who received impermissible benefits were no longer with the program when mu launched the investigation mu vacated all wins from the 2013 14 season the tigers were 23 13 that season under haith his last year at mizzou mu paid the ncaa a 5 000 fine the basketball team self imposed the loss of one scholarship in 2015 16 and an additional scholarship to be incurred no later than the 2017 18 season mu placed restrictions on the recruiting activities of the basketball staff during the years of 2014 15 through 2016 17 anderson s staff is prohibited from talking to recruits on the phone for six weeks during the 2016 17 academic year former associate head coach tim fuller was prohibited from off campus recruiting for three months mu imposed a one year postseason ban for the 2015 16 men s basketball season which included the sec tournament mu will not receive league revenues from the 2016 tournament mu permanently disassociated a booster listed as representative no 1 and prohibited him from receiving tickets making donations or otherwise representing the university that booster was mark tuley the ceo of t3 solutions a national intelligence company based out of martinez ga the huntsville mo native attended mizzou from 1998 2000 mu disassociated representative no 2 for a period of two years prohibiting he and his wife from receiving tickets making donations or otherwise representing the university he s described in the ncaa report as the general manager of a popular resort in missouri sources have identified that booster as fred dehner the general manager of tan tar a resort at the lake of the ozarks not to mention the negative image mu has recently received ,1,mizzou
Sebiscuits,the decision to fire him we are just now getting past the sanctions that crippled our ability to recruit i do not understand what people were expecting of this team i agree we look like shit now but how is ka to be blamed for the shear lack of talent when there nothing to bring talent in we are going through a full on rebuild people need to trust the process and understand that haith fucked our shit up and it going to be a while until we are back to normal it will be even longer now that we are losing ka how many other coaches are going to be looking at mizzou as a long term coaching job and not just a stepping stone in their career ,2,mizzou
Sebiscuits,why even bring this up literally no one has said anything about any of that ,1,mizzou
Sebiscuits, took a hell of a long time how long does everyone think rebuilding a team from the ground up take mizzou has no recent memory of being a basketball power which makes it harder to recruit mizzou has just this season been allowed to go back to tournaments how do you get good players to come if they cannot play in a tourney the team lost scholarships which makes it harder to recruit people around here seem to forget about how hard frankie fuck boy dicked over our program but ka is just now getting over it all and what does mizzou do they give arguably the only coach that sees mizzou as a long term coaching job the axe all because fans cannot stand seeing our team be shit did you all forget the sanctions killed recruiting restitution and withholding from competition for impermissible benefits received by student athletes jakeenan gant was suspended for the first nine games of the 2014 15 season the other players who received impermissible benefits were no longer with the program when mu launched the investigation mu vacated all wins from the 2013 14 season the tigers were 23 13 that season under haith his last year at mizzou mu paid the ncaa a 5 000 fine the basketball team self imposed the loss of one scholarship in 2015 16 and an additional scholarship to be incurred no later than the 2017 18 season mu placed restrictions on the recruiting activities of the basketball staff during the years of 2014 15 through 2016 17 anderson s staff is prohibited from talking to recruits on the phone for six weeks during the 2016 17 academic year former associate head coach tim fuller was prohibited from off campus recruiting for three months mu imposed a one year postseason ban for the 2015 16 men s basketball season which included the sec tournament mu will not receive league revenues from the 2016 tournament mu permanently disassociated a booster listed as representative no 1 and prohibited him from receiving tickets making donations or otherwise representing the university that booster was mark tuley the ceo of t3 solutions a national intelligence company based out of martinez ga the huntsville mo native attended mizzou from 1998 2000 mu disassociated representative no 2 for a period of two years prohibiting he and his wife from receiving tickets making donations or otherwise representing the university he s described in the ncaa report as the general manager of a popular resort in missouri sources have identified that booster as fred dehner the general manager of tan tar a resort at the lake of the ozarks what does everyone expect from him at this point why do people expect our team to be talented now i get that they are doing awful now but for fucks sake people have some faith in the process ,1,mizzou
Sebiscuits,i am wondering what everyone was expecting from him with no way to recruit why would ka have been able to put anything together and why was that expected this decision seems either very short sighted or it just the athletic department pandering to ignorant fans ,1,mizzou
Sebiscuits,i did not say it needs to be 100 the same but since he has not said his stance outright it a pretty safe assumption that the opinions of the people he appointing reflect his own i would say there is evidence in what sessions has said and in spicer comparing weed to opioids which also backs up this assumption ,1,The_Donald
Sebiscuits,it is against their laws though ,2,worldnews
Sebiscuits,i never said it was but the fact is that trump appointed sessions and if that is sessions stance on marijuana then it also reflective of the administrations stance on marijuana ,1,The_Donald
Sebiscuits,that a good question considering the dea denied a request to reschedule marijuana apparently its as dangerous as heroin is say it going to take a lot of state level support before the feds do anything about it ,6,The_Donald
Sebiscuits,i would not put money on congress doing that the only way marijuana will be legal in the us is if it done at the state level having the federal government crack down on it will only be a set back a very unnecessary wasteful set back on a potentially multi billion dollar industry ,8,The_Donald

Sebiscuits,what do you mean that is not how it works it not about being yanked in one direction or another when you are an elected representative you are supposed to represent all of your constituents not just those that voted for you it when people stop working with each other that you end up with a nonfunctional divided government like ours ,7,Conservative

Sebiscuits,jesus why do not we just say fuck it and scrap every non military federal agency then we can just dump all our money into it and make everyone join the military at age 8 and become the new sparta 60 of our budget is clearly not enough money to keep us safe and the only thing that will make this country great again is to get that number up to 100 no one in this country is safe until every man woman child and senior citizen has a drone missile to drop on anyone that makes them feel unsafe ,9,qualitynews

Sebiscuits, that was the public goal what was his private goal fair enough i do think it too early to form an opinion on this either way it good to be skeptical i just do not think we have enough info to be able to say what is going on either way as to why we should lift sanctions i think it important to have as few enemies as possible so why not at least try diplomatic solutions they do have leverage in this situation as they have large influence in the region and are potentially a nuclear nation if we can make it so our interests align more then some of that influence would have positive effects in the region instead of what they have been we need to stop giving them reasons to work against us and start giving them reasons to work with us you say they are terrorists which is true to some extent but no more so than saudi arabia and our country for some reason or another is completely fine with working with them https www google com amp www cbsnews com amp news 60 minutes 911 classified report steve kroft client safari,1,The_Donald

Sebiscuits,yes people will lash out but he is a professional athlete act like one he sets an example for everyone playing at lower levels the fact is that what he did was dirty it was against the laws of the game and saying that he was angry about what had just happened is no excuse for his actions you want to get him back then do it legally and lay him out in good clean hit i do not understand how being pissed off is an excuse to break the rules ,0,hawks
Sebiscuits,dishing out justice is a part of hockey but it still needs to be done in a way that follows the rules keith could have gotten a big clean hit on him later i say retaliation does not belong in the game when it done illegally like what keith did if it did belong in the game it would not be illegal and you said that it should count for something so are you not trying to justify what he did to some extent and i agreed that hot headed was a better way to describe him because his history shows that he not going out their just looking to hurt someone he retaliating if he were going out there looking to hurt someone for no reason that a dirty player that does not mean that what he did was not dirty because it was and why should not professional athletes be held to a higher standard they set an example for players at all lower levels yes they are human but that why it not zero tolerance and they are only suspended this type of thing will happen but that not an excuse for it to be okay for anyone to lash out if anything professional athletes should be the most in control of their emotions cause you know they are professionals ,-1,hawks
Sebiscuits,i agree that hotheaded is a better way to describe him but how should that have any impact on the punishment the bottom line is that kind of thing does not belong in hockey whether he was provoked or not referees exist for a reason it not the players job to dish out justice on one another even if a ref misses a call in my opinion the fact that he retaliated is by no means justification for his actions if anything his history of dirty plays assuming they were all out of retaliation just means that he needs to be more disciplined as a player i think this punishment was handled well because that is not how professional athletes should act ,0,hawks

Sebiscuits,wow you are dense you are the one making my example of how stereotypes are wrong about race you clearly missed the point there and i only brought one race into my other point after you did because at my school there are very few students who are not black or white again missing my point here i said we had black guys in our chapter to show how we do not exclude based on race as a majority of college rape is carried out by frat brothers this is just flat out wrong yes pledges have died from hazing but again this is the fraction of a percent of scumbags who are scumbags with or without a fraternity it is extremely rare and is most often caused by alcohol not that that makes it right but it not like they are being beaten and tortured a pledge can walk away at literally any time and when it comes down to it it is there decision wither they go through with the hazing or not in my experience it always been the people who have been dropped or not given a bid that hold the biggest grudges against fraternities i have plenty of friends not in greek life that do not give two fucks about greek life good or bad not sure where all these fraternity guys that walk around acting bigger than jesus are because i have never seen one only heard about them on the internet i am hearing a lot of baseless accusations on your end with no facts or experience to back any of it up you call me ignorant but i am the one who has had first hand experience here this is a legitimate question what experience have you had that gives you the knowledge to be able to form such a solid opinion on fraternities because everything you have said so far is the same ole anti fraternity bullshit that gets spat around all over the internet from people that know nothing of fraternities and back to my original point stereotypes do exist because of a small portion of that group that why to say all blacks are thugs mexicans illegals and muslims terrorists is wrong because of the small portion of those groups that are those things those stereotypes are created i hope you can at least agree that those stereotypes are incorrect ,1,AskReddit

Sebiscuits,wow i am not bringing race into it i am using that as an example of how stereotypes are a vast over simplification of any group and by saying fraternities stereotype is completely true is hypocritical and shows how ignorant you really are about them violent and dangerous hazing rituals well you are clearly not a member of a fraternity so you would not know about any of that firsthand but what most people outside of greek life do hear about it is very exaggerated and comes from kids who have been dropped from a fraternity or who have left on a bad note often they try to make the fraternity look bad out of anger or jealousy or whatever you want to call it sexism elitism and racism absolute complete bullshit ask any sorority girl if they think that greek guys are more sexist than non greek guys and they will tell you no it not fraternities that make that small fraction of a percent of fraternity men creepy scumbags they would be like that with or without a fraternity elitism fuck you i pay for my college 100 on my own along with literally every other expense i have i come from a lower middle class family i never had my parents handing money to me when i grew up and i have worked for everything i have so you can get fucked on that point and racism first of all there are black fraternities that do not allow white people but i suppose that is not racist my fraternity just initiated 4 black kids out of a class of 18 so yeah i guess i am really fucking racist are not i so tell me again what the sad truth is because the only one i see is this country being ruined by stupid cunts like you that talk on subjects they know nothing about and cast judgment on an entire group of people based off what they have heard from about a small minority of them put your pitchfork down and go fuck yourself do not tell me who i am and how i act ,0,AskReddit

Sebiscuits,because of title ix the police can still be involved and do their own investigation but it entirely separate from the universities investigation a good example is the cu boulder case http m washingtonexaminer com university of colorado settles with student accused of sexual assault article 2560652 ignoring jane s admitted credibility issues and the police investigation finding no evidence to support the claim of sexual assault along with excluding john text message evidence and finding john responsible based on a biased process is what led to the lawsuit the university found john responsible and suspended him for three terms a punishment noted by the lawsuit as being unprecedentedly harsh the decision according to john lawsuit came about from ignoring exculpatory evidence and allowing the investigation to go forward despite jane admittedly lying about the encounter wanting to get revenge and a police report finding no evidence to support the claim public universities at least in my state have to enforce title ix or they loose federal funding and of course they are going to care about their money way more than having a few lives ruined by false rape accusations it really fucked basically if a girl goes to the title ix office and accuses a guy of rape at my school he cannot even defend himself he gets a hearing but no lawyer is allowed to be with him and it legal because it a university kangaroo court and not a real one ,10,explainlikeimfive

Sebiscuits,you mean it completely up to the police to repair the relationship they definitely have to help but it also up to the black community you only blame the police for the lack of trust but it a two way street neither side trust the other because the other side does not trust them why would cops trust the black community when there is such an obvious hatred towards them and has been for some time no the police are not perfect but neither is the black community you say they do not care if they have the trust that is bullshit you think cops enjoy going into these neighborhoods were everyone hates them absolutely not there lives are on the line what do they have to gain you point to laissez faire racism and housing discrimination which do exist to some unknown extent but i will probably be called racist here you also ignore the fact that the amount of crime compared to population for the black community is higher than other races so the cops distrust in the black community is not entirely unwarranted the only way for this problem to be fixed is if both sides admit to their short comings it a complex problem and it not just one side that is to blame but it seems people cannot grasp that concept ,-1,pics
Sebiscuits,sorry i should have clarified a typical proper rugby hit will be the all of the defenders force hitting you straight into the gut or into your thighs you will be absorbing all that force on a smaller area of your body where as in football most big hits are shoulder pad to shoulder pad the pads spread out the impact onto your actual body the hits in football may be a little bit more forceful but pads are really good at there job it certainly does not feel good the two really are hard to compare though since there is such a big difference in the way they are generally done but it is important to remember that the average number of tackles per player per game for football is 4 in rugby it 16 that definatly counts for something ,1,sports
Sebiscuits,more force exerted over a larger area though when you get hit in rugby all the force is straight into you the biggest hits i have taken in rugby have hurt worse than the biggest hits i have taken in football at least when there were no injuries ,-1,sports

Sebiscuits,they cannot leave its a crime scene so cops need to be there and if it were only a few then the large crowd of angry people could easily overpower them possibly contaminating the scene or attacking the cops what you would have them do would be the opposite of their job as a enforcer of the law ,1,news

Sebiscuits,but maybe people see blackness as inherently threatening because of the higher violent crime rates in the black population just saying that to stop cops from suspecting and being more worried about black people committing crimes black people need to stop doing them and also it not only minorities that get shot by cops you use the aurora shooting as an example which is a drastically different scenario then what we have here and in the brown case ,2,news
Sebiscuits,you missed the point i was explaining the difference between restraint and no restraint and unfortunately large groups of angry people tend to only respond to force the cops are there to make sure none of there own are attacked by angry people and to make sure there are no riots again they are handling the situation well and using the same techniques you will find in any other country yes people will not like the cops for pepper spraying them but the people there already do not like the cops and without a little show of force they could easily escalate the situation serious question what would you want them to do in this situation ,9,news

Sebiscuits,so why are coal and oil a better alternative than something they would pay for once and then have comparatively few expenses for after would not giving a poor person in africa a solar panel to power their home be better than a gas generator the price for oil and gas is only going to rise and it is already too expensive for most of the poor you sound like you want everyone to be equal even if that means no one has anything is that right or am i getting the wrong idea am trying to understand your argument but it just does not make much sense ,1,news

Sebiscuits,where have you gotten these facts from i have not actually seen anything that says that ,1,videos
Sebiscuits,that may be true but most people live in the same neighborhoods as people of their own race and most homicides are people that know each other so it would make sense but if a large group of people with statistics showing that their race is historically more violent than mine came into my neighborhood i would be more worried about them there are less intra racial crimes because the two races do not mix as much as they do among themselves ,1,videos
Sebiscuits,http en m wikipedia org wiki race and crime in the united states or maybe it because black people accounted for 52 5 of homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008 and that of youth gang members nation wide 35 were black in 2011 white people are probably less likely to be hurt by black people because they live in different areas and can stay away from the gangs for the most part ,4,videos
Sebiscuits,i am missing the point you are trying to make here is some other random persons opinion supposed to mean something to me because they are white ,1,pics
Sebiscuits,i would have to disagree with you just because a word only refers to black people does not mean it racist what about calling someone white trash i do not think that racist even though it only refers to white people i suppose it the same reason you cannot call a nonwhite person a cracker the word is tied to a race it would be much easier if you could use it on anyone though ,3,ImGoingToHellForThis
Sebiscuits,so if i dislike a group of any black people based on their actions and character it racist just because they are black it would be racist if i said all black people acted that way but i clearly said that not all do if a white person acted like a thug and criminal i would dislike them just as much you actually could not be any further off ,3,ImGoingToHellForThis

Sebiscuits,we will it obviously a little different here in the states and i am from st louis so i know a little bit more about this than the average redditor it is not confirmed that he was shot 8 times the officers story says that mike brown tackled the cop into his car got on top of him and there was a struggle for the cops gun put yourself in the cops position would you have only shot him once if my life is in danger i am doing everything i can to stop him ,1,pics
Sebiscuits,blaming racial profiling means its a race issue i am sure police do it whether they mean it or not either way they do it because of the unfortunate facts see page 2 www colorofcrime com colorofcrime2005 pdf if the facts did not say they commit more crimes id agree with you that the system is against them but its just not true the police side of the story says that mike brown attacked the officer and was shot in self deference i am not saying that what actually happened but the cop may have been in life threatening danger if it true ,1,pics
Sebiscuits,why does it immediately have to become a race issue whenever its a black person involved i find it very unfair to the police that it is always assumed that it was because of race yes sometimes it maybe be but that does not mean that you can make that assumption each time part of the reason i am saying this is not just because of what you said but the protesters were calling for justice immediately in their eyes the officer was guilty the second it was a black kid that was shot ,1,pics

Sebiscuits,i live in st louis cops were not there during the protests on the first day then when rioting started they came they are not doing anything to the protesters until they become violent as to the innocent micheal brown it is known that he had just stolen cigarettes from a quiktrip the one that was burnt down which is why he was being stopped obviously this is not worthy of being killed i am just saying that there is more to the story than the news and internet talks about so do not cast judgment until all the facts are known ,1,pics
