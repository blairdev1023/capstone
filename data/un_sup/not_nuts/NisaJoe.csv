NisaJoe,as much as i would like to say i would be brave and try and help i honestly think i would shit myself and run away as fast as i possibly could i would obviously assess the situation though if i felt safe i would see what i could do to help people that were not so lucky ,1,AskReddit
NisaJoe,alright i will try that in a sec,1,Paladins

NisaJoe,this was the best game had it on ps1 when i was a kid and bought it on ps3 when they released it as a classic always found the elevator level so hard ,9,gaming
NisaJoe,did you just call being gay a predetermined illness ,6,Smite
NisaJoe,i have noticed that too cannot find anything about it on their twitter or anything i am on ps4 ,1,Paladins
NisaJoe,yeah i can see that makes sense i suppose if they some how made it focus on actual play rather than just kills it could be good obviously i do not know how easy that would be i imagine not very easy at all ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i think fafnir so much potential with the dragon ultimate ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,i rarely have a balanced game on ranked joust it always a stomp either by my team or we get stomped ,17,Smite
NisaJoe,it still in beta so things not working quite how they should be is to be expected surely ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,i have been playing since ps4 beta and it the worst patch i have seen ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,tyr anhur and even isis are all pretty popular right now ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,christ i am actually cringing,9,Smite
NisaJoe,i am having to close the game every time i die how can they release a patch with a bug this game breaking ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,there better be a hotfix today i have played one game that lasted 10 minutes it had 5 disconnects and froze in the post game screen ,11,Smite
NisaJoe,to give some more detail i think that people that have the bundle can see other people upgraded pedestal but people that do not have it just see the basic one ,2,Smite
NisaJoe, my flowers dont heal lmao til i have played sylvanus a decent amount as well i am such a scrub man ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,uts nisa joe ps4,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i am diamond 4 on ps4 and i find that the toxicity is worse from master and gm players than platinum and diamond i had a gm message me telling me i am bad even though he had a bad game himself so i told him he also had a bad game and he replied look at my rank okay mate nice rank you still played badly ,5,Smite
NisaJoe,you can see from his post history that he been playing smite for over a year ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,yeah but before adventures it was 1 week behind now it 2 if we are lucky ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,happened to me and friends before on ps4 too ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,it should do but i am level 30 with about 450 hours and i often get put with sub level 30 when i solo queue not quite sure why ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,some people watch a lot of youtube or streams and have a much better grasp on conquest than some people who have played hundreds of games ,7,Smite
NisaJoe,i feel like one thing you do not need to worry about is hirez listening to the community s,1,Smite
NisaJoe,right but you are claiming that he is now performing better than he already was which was already good i am on console so i have not played with the hades change yet i personally do not think he needed changing in the first place i think he was really strong when people knew how to use him if they made a big change to a god such as anhur and anhur now had a big increase in win percentage across the board would you still say he does not need to be nerfed and they should just learn to play against him or are you only saying this because you particularly like hades ,1,Smite
NisaJoe, already has a high win rate it will be even higher now followed by would o not nerf him if a god has an unusually high win rate then they are likely going to get nerfed because this means they are not balanced if players find a god consistently difficult to counter or play against chances are something needs to change with the god hi rez does not want players to be frustrated whenever they play a certain god ,0,Smite
NisaJoe,he means them laughing and taunting and stuff,1,Smite
NisaJoe,cannot wait for this patch to be delayed 2 weeks on console and still be full of bugs ,4,Smite
NisaJoe,for example playing ranked but doing some sort of art while queuing i would probably watch ,5,Smite
NisaJoe,you have got nothing to lose try it man ,24,Smite
NisaJoe,i imagine you played bad people in your qualifiers then ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,hmm no idea why it wo not work on my laptop then ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,he clearly knows something we do not ,3,Smite
NisaJoe,my favourite part of that scene is mac trying not to laugh ,4,IASIP
NisaJoe,yeah i get that the same thing happens on conquest but a broken god has a bigger impact when it 1 of 3 rather than 1 of 5 ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i am talking about joust not duel but my point is also relevant to duel there just so many gods that literally need to be banned man it painful ,3,Smite
NisaJoe,not sure if you can call an item broken just because you do not like it i agree it strong but i do not know if i would say it broken ,18,Smite
NisaJoe,matchmaking ,8,Smite
NisaJoe,at the same time i love it when i do not get spammed with you rock when i die and people just say no problem bming only makes things worse ,8,Smite
NisaJoe,no idea i am in the uk it seems to have stopped now ,1,playstation
NisaJoe,when i say it has happened before i am talking last season so if they are aware of it then they are not doing anything about it sadly but yeah it not going to stop me playing the game just frustrating especially losing tp ,1,Smite
NisaJoe, it casuals so it does not matter is such a stupid way to look at it why would you want to win or have fun it casual bro ,13,Smite
NisaJoe,hmm i do not know if it because i queue at night saying that it not like i am queuing at ridiculous times usually around 9pm 12am ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i am still qualifying because i usually give up searching because it takes so long also i am eu ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,close river phoenix burger with bacon bacon fries ,1,Smite

NisaJoe,if you pay for a service you have the right to complain about what you are given ,3,DiscJam
NisaJoe,i have had to close the application every time i have had the issue also there seems to be some sort of issue to do with your offline character customisation accidentally staying when you join an online match and it not letting you play ,1,DiscJam
NisaJoe,hi louis obviously i am a big fan we have all seen some very strange things you have witnessed or done on screen such as watching graphic pornos being filmed my question is what is the weirdest thing that happened to you that was not caught on camera ,32,IAmA
NisaJoe,you should do more in this style i like it ,3,Smite
NisaJoe,sorry assembles if you prefer ,6,food
NisaJoe,as a mcdonalds employee that cooks big macs on the regular i respect this attempt looks like a treat ,7,food

NisaJoe,sounds a lot like my gcse history teacher but i found his nicknames funny ,5,AskReddit
NisaJoe,alright sweet ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,yeah it happening loads happened to my friend in the same game as me ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,update second game in a row this has happened ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i would pay 700 gems told myself i would not pay any more than 800 though so i would not get it after the discounted price ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,it 700 gems if you buy the bundle whilst the valley of victory adventure is out goes up to 1000 after that ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,alright cool thanks everyone ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i can see why that would be shit but you will find your way ,2,AskReddit
NisaJoe,cilia you are breaking his heart you are shaking his confidence daily ,249,AskReddit

NisaJoe,alright cool thanks ,1,Brawlhalla
NisaJoe,i see missed opportunity really it got potential for a good voice pack ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,came here for the bird law comment was not disappointed ty ,44,wholesomememes
NisaJoe,for anyone wanting some way to follow the podcast aggro shared this link on his twitter http domination podbean com feed if you copy that in to your podcasts on whatever device you use it should keep you updated ,4,Smite
NisaJoe,yeah two in a row is good i would be buzzing i find that i get a lot less potatoes when i duo queue when i solo queue i get some terrible people like no one calling a role and they all just go to solo lane why ,4,Smite
NisaJoe,i feel your pain i play console and i swear my team will never group up late game they just take turns running in to their team and dying also it seems that nobody on console can be bothered to take objectives like fire giant and gold fury they all just ignore calls 80 of the time god damn potatoes ,25,Smite
NisaJoe,i find i look instinctively even when i actively try not to ,2,gaming
NisaJoe,i saw this too i think there may be one coming in the next few days but that just a guess ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,assassin already has one ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,nemesis and fafnir thought i would offer you a bit of a challenge ,1,Smite
NisaJoe, literally always ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,unintentionally i did not counter pick i just picked who i would normally play i lost the game anyway ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,quite disappointing really why make it a recolour of the jandroid skin but not give it the jandroid vp also default abilities is boring at least put a bit of effort in to these skins instead of just giving a skin a purple glow and changing it back to the default vp ,24,Smite
NisaJoe,right but this is obviously an issue that something should be done about if the stream is a few minutes behind to then maybe the picks and bans should be as well ,0,Smite
NisaJoe,i would like squirrel squad ratatoskr please biggest tip i would give to new players is to find out how to play conquest before jumping in to a game with no idea how to play you will find it more fun if you know what you are doing also allegiance to win ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i am also from shropshire boyo,2,Smite
NisaJoe,terrible times ,0,Smite
NisaJoe,they did do a founders pack with a limited ymir skin and exclusive ares skin for ps4 ,3,Smite
NisaJoe,cupid as caspar the friendly ghost ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i had someone on my team that solo queued and it was his second game me and both of my friends i was playing with are level 30 ,15,Smite
NisaJoe,this is a great idea and i hope hi rez take this on board ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i feel like it really comes down to personal preference on that one ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,i start with dt t1 of devos and one of each pot then warrior tabi ichaival qins wind demon deathbringer then sell ichaival for either third crit or some pen depending on how i am feeling in terms of levelling i level her 1 then 2 then 3 and the ult as soon as i can as it still does some decent damage if i use it right ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,yeah i try assault but then get frustrated cus i swear 90 of the teams i play get an ares ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,sweet i will do my best to resist going on to try and break the losing streak ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,how long a break are we talking ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i think you misunderstood the post ,3,Smite
NisaJoe,hou yi ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,does it work on console if so i would like to be involved ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i love this idea i think choosing one side or the other is a good element and adds a bit more friendly more likely unfriendly competition to casuals ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i can see why you would want a change to respawn timers but they are a blessing when you are behind and keep the game that small bit more even when someone is ahead also i think the bulldemon king buff is about right for how easy he is to kill if the buff were to do more then they would need to make it a harder fight ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,there no difficulty in getting any god to diamond though ,5,Smite
NisaJoe,medusa,1,Smite
NisaJoe,in duel i cannot stand anubis in joust awilix is annoying af awilix vulcan sobek bacchus brilliant what a lot of thought you put in to that team comp ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,do not think i have played a game without 2 nikes in yet ,3,Smite
NisaJoe,4000 points in a single game because the rewards go off a total points thing and it 5 points per round on easy mode and 15 per round on hard ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,smiteguru is a good website for looking up builds you can look at the most popular items for each game mode and each god etc as for a god that is good for doing damage and getting out bastet could be a good one for you to try also you cannot go wrong with a neith pick if you are new she quite easy to pick up ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,acknowledging your own mistakes and not just blaming someone else for anything bad that happens the amount of people that think they are perfect and it everyone else fault when they do bad is way too high ,5,Smite
NisaJoe,i got epsilon sol which i was happy with ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,i am an alg boy ,4,Smite
NisaJoe,189,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i main adc but for some reason i just cannot play hou yi ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,correct ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,i have not received anything either not sure if it because i play on ps4 or what ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,i assumed the three frames were just 3 concepts and they would just choose one but you could be on to something there ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i believe it the highest you get in any of the 3 ranked modes ,3,Smite
NisaJoe,when your team massively over extends dies and then spams you rock because you did not suicide with them ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,you are always the community manager of the day in our hearts 3,47,Smite
NisaJoe,i would say it definitely worth buying it helps get you started in the game and keeps you interested ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,me too izanami with a bit of pen absolutely shreds towers ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,i think izzy is izanami and i would not build cdr on her ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,you can look at it as people are buying whatever hi rez offer or you can view it as hi rez offering whatever players want i agree the sports skins are a bit poo but a lot of the other jokey skins are great but i suppose it depends where you draw the line between joke skin and serious ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,the joke skins are what a large amount of players like the most so naturally hi rez will keep on bringing them out because they know a majority of players enjoy them and will buy them ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,i am interested,1,Smite
NisaJoe,that a shame i really liked ven at alg he played well at lan i was shocked to see him leave kicked ,2,Smite
NisaJoe,i was thinking the same i think venenu tweeted something involving the letter n but he could have just been trolling ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,no quoting from me i am reasonably new to following the spl so i am interested to hear what other people think ,1,Smite
NisaJoe,i suppose hi rez acknowledge that mobile gods are generally the most used and they want their new gods to be played,7,Smite
NisaJoe,a couple of t2 skins is as good as it gets for me,1,Smite
NisaJoe,commenting for ne zha,1,Smite
