SoldierZulu,sorry for taking so long to respond but thanks my curiosity got the better of me and i have sent a letter to the address noted on the nj treasury department claim contacts page with as much information as i was able to find i am so far unable to find either of my grandparents socials through google fu in fact there barely any freely available data on them on the internet at all and i am usually pretty good at going down rabbit holes to find information i could spend a small amount of money to look them up though and i will think about that i had not thought of contacting the county they lived in it a good idea so i will hop on it beyond that i think i will just await the response to my letter seemed like the most reasonable first step and it will at least establish mutual contact if i get any interesting updates i will post an update submission referencing this comment thread ,2,personalfinance

SoldierZulu,this is rough i am 39 years old i have stage 4 but it is possible i may beat it i have responded well to the chemo and radiation so far but you never know when the next scan is gonna light up some other part of your body and that always in the back of my head i have about a 40 chance of surviving it to a full 5 year cure statistically i am leaving my son videos dozens of them so far he only 2 a letter is not enough i do not think he needs to see and hear me remember that i was a person if i do pass it likely wo not be for another 5 to 6 years due to the type of cancer and how relatively unaggressive it is so he will remember me as a young boy at least he will know daddy he will understand the loss when it comes and that why it very important that i make these videos because when he older daddy will just be a vague memory with a vague face and maybe some standout core memories as it were yes i watched inside out the me that would change the way i talk to him as he gets older wo not physically be there but in a way i can be before i make a video i decide what age i want him to be when he sees it and do my best to try and talk to the camera in a way that would be appropriate for that age not easy so as he gets older dad gets older too i start to talk about more mature things and things that i did when i was that age my plans back then what i hope his plans have become mistakes i made and good choices lots of things by the time i die he will have hundreds of videos on thousands of topics and this way i will be there for him through thick or thin if he ever needs me and now i think i will stop there because i am starting to get a little choked up this is the hard part about making videos too because every once in a while you will say something to the camera that causes you to realize something you had not thought of and it just breaks you and then you have to erase and start over yes i do have a couple videos where i cry but he does not need to see me weepy in like 75 of them lol the only thing i want is to be able to watch my son grow up nobody can give that to me although i appreciate the op sentiment i will continue fighting and i will beat it back as best i can wish me luck and if you ever find yourself in a similar situation make those damn videos ,4,AskReddit

SoldierZulu,i am a stage 4 cancer patient all of my prescriptions have large cancer society watermarks all over them when i first got sick my medical onc told us to find a pharmacy that stocks pain meds regularly and to shop around because some pharmacists can be stubborn with pain meds we did not follow his advice last week i got my usual script for oxycodone and my normal pharmacy was out and it would take a week before they restocked so we went from pharmacy to pharmacy and all of them did not have the quantity the script called for we finally end up at a cvs near a hospital and they have enough in stock but after looking at my script id and giving both my wife and i a glance over he decided he was not going to fill it when asked why the pharmacist said that he did not feel morally comfortable giving me that much pain medication we would been on the road for 2 hours we pleaded with him to verify the script with my doctor pointed out the stage 4 cancer the fact that i am dying etc guy would not budge and i was so frustrated i thought i might either start shouting at him or crying so we left luckily the walgreens across the street had no problems filling the script and the pharmacist was very nice left a 1 star review for the cvs on google it appears that this policy is common to at least cvs and kroger since those are 2 pharmacies that turned away a completely legit patient because of moral issues edit grammar spelling,1,TwoXChromosomes
SoldierZulu,yes more or less you can plead guilty and in the same sentence say even if i did not do it in the eyes of the law however the guilty plea is all that matters it is a legal admission of guilt and they will treat it as such you can also sometimes plead no contest http blogs findlaw com blotter 2012 10 how does guilty differ from no contest html to the charge s which is different and is not a legal admission of guilt both will have the effect of skipping a trial entirely though ,1,JusticeServed

SoldierZulu,admitting to the crime depending on what it is and expressing remorse and being apologetic can often lead to a lighter sentence if you admit that you were wrong and demonstrate regret for your actions it shows the court that you take the charge s seriously and they are generally more willing to show leniency sometimes people will initially plead not guilty and while awaiting trial or during trial may receive a sentence offer a plea deal from the prosecutor that the defendant can accept if they plead guilty this is however in no way guaranteed and if the defendant is being particularly shitty or the crime particularly egregious no deals will be forthcoming and the end result may be a much much stiffer penalty such as maximum sentence that last part is the absolute one thing any defendant wants to avoid obviously edit fuck me this thread is 2 days old well there you go,1,JusticeServed

SoldierZulu,no that notion is the result of nearly all information being available all of the time to nearly anyone do not think this is representative of any sort of majority back in the drug fueled 60s and 70s what do you think people my age middle aged thought about those hippies and how much do you think the idea of them being the next generation terrified them and now here they are running the most conservative government the country has seen in 50 odd years the main point is that every generation thinks the next one is gonna be hopeless the main difference is that we can now watch it all even the most extreme examples with minimal effort and if you spend a lot of time looking specifically for this stuff or you are in a place where you are exposed to it often you are going to see a lot of it of course and that where critical thinking and the ability to separate confirmation bias from the big picture comes in ,13,PublicFreakout

SoldierZulu,trinity aged as evidenced by her appearances in netflix marvel lineup but not much to my eyes wrinkles and crows feet really no biggie and totally fine if when they do a time skip oh wait we are talking reboots why not a matrix sequel a next generation type story set a ways in the future the damn first movie is not even 20 years old and the 3rd movie just barely a decade if they absolutely must do something with the franchise i would prefer a an animatrix style production focusing on different characters during the events of the movie or maybe guerilla warfare against the remainder of post revolutions renegade machines and programs whole new cast b a sequel with the appropriate amount of time passage in that order personally i would prefer they just left it alone for a good decade at least ,8,movies

SoldierZulu,jeez the way law enforcement went after this guy after he missed his bench appearance is pretty scary by itself shooting his kid and dog man the response was way over the top and the worst possible choice of all the stupid choices they had had the county done their due diligence guy would have been in court a month later told his side of the story might be in jail but nobody would be dead and who knows if the assertion that he was not actually aryan brotherhood is true and he just lived around a bunch of the shitheads the guy might have given up the ones that were truly about to set off some violent shit and if he truly was a nazi and involved in all of it off to jail for a long time and all of this still never happens just a cascade effect of total fuckups all the down also want to say that the term is in absentia and i only mention it because its a cool word and a pretty specific thing ,70,worldnews
SoldierZulu,i honestly do not remember whether i had a gps program or not i do remember installing a maps program that was so large i had to fit it on the sd card and it was all offline maps i remember the installer having checkboxes for the regions to install because each region took up a bunch of space it was super handy at the time as long as i knew cross streets i could search and find out where i was and then figure out where to go next meant never stopping for maps or directions although pushing map updates to the phone weekly was always a slow process and was kinda annoying having a passenger navigate was also pretty neat people always got a kick out of it ,5,bestof
SoldierZulu,somehow under the right circumstances with one candidate failing to hit the swing states and the other traveling there in person and loudly saying he was literally going to save them and get all their jobs back yes people really wanted to hear that apparently things like climate change and all the other supposed hoaxes and manufactured failings of the left do not mean shit to people getting paid nothing college fuck the people that likely voted trump either finished college ages ago or just do not understand the near indentured servitude it practically created for young people trump hit the main notes of everything they wanted to hear even if he would contradict himself the next day people cherrypicked what he said and ran with it as long as you could selectively filter out or excuse the contradictions that snake oil salesman had something for everyone if you were a conservative ,2,worldnews

SoldierZulu,a while ago 2005 or 6 i had one of the last windows mobile 5 devices a cingular 8125 that was considered ridiculously overpriced for the time but it looked so cool with the touchscreen and slide out keyboard and i remember installing programs were not called apps yet over usb are you saying the program came on a dvd and you had to to connect the phone via usb to install it that absurd those things barely had any storage and certainly not in the gigabytes man at least most wm5 devs back then just had small installers you downloaded after buying there were tricks to direct download to the device and install without a pc but it was all pretty difficult since the built in browser and many alternatives were non graphical the experimental browsers that showed images were nigh unusable due to speeds and just terrible web standard implementations fuck wm5 was a nightmare i had almost forgotten that period of my smartish cellphone history ended up losing it right at the end of 06 and replacing it with an iphone ,19,bestof

SoldierZulu,some slip through the cracks but the disability approval process is long and full of bureaucratic red tape the people who slip through the cracks are either exaggerating to their doctors to make it seem like they are feeling worse than they are or they are flat out committing fraud and lying on their ssdi paperwork manipulating a doctor is much easier than trying to forge all the documents they would need for approval in these cases where the patient seems to have legitimate symptoms and the doctor signs off on it the best you can probably hope for is that the person gets caught doing something their disability should not allow them to do it sucks but that humanity for ya give some people an inch and they will take a mile they do not think about how their actions hurt legitimately disabled people in a negative light when they desperately need this aid edit just wanted to add people like her should definitely not stop us or the government from giving aid to those that need it to let someone else suffer for the actions of people like her is not right either ,5,JusticeServed

SoldierZulu,i do not know how much you understand about guns but i am guessing not much for example us responsible gun owners keep our weapons secured and unloaded and i am not just talking about stashing it at the top of a closet secure your guns in lock boxes and gun cases and be responsible and your kids will never just play with them or shoot themselves when they get depressed because they will never have access to them for example i keep my primary defense pistol in a lock box unloaded with a slide lock for additional safety i can still access and load it in a matter of seconds but a child would never even get past the lock box let alone the slide lock tons of people own guns and live long lives that manage not to kill themselves or their kids the stories you read about in the news are people who have failed even the most basic gun security precautions guns are all around you i am a progressive liberal but i am armed and i have taken firearms training i live in a state where nearly any kind of weapon is legal unless federally banned i cannot help that i am surrounded by guns i can only put myself on equal footing and that what i have done ,25,Fuckthealtright

SoldierZulu,i am curious how the democrats could be so goddamn good at concocting this apparent massive witch hunt conspiracy and yet completely politically inept on just about every other level lately and not only that but this conspiracy would have to be so elaborate and well put together to convince multiple departments of the fbi to investigate it i just do not understand how you would arrive at that conclusion when they have found evidence that russia tried to meddle in our election and possibly succeeded although i am not sure the outcome would be much different hillary was just not hitting the dirt in the states she needed to and was way too damn cocky that she was unbeatable up against a joke like trump they found evidence that they tried to do the same in france and people like mike flynn probably do not just happen by accident russia has been on heavy offense lately and we can all thank vladimir oviet revival putin for that whether the case turns up anything more than whatever we know so far that there were perhaps some improper meetings that should not have happened but nothing illegal is unknown i do not know if the case truly has merit or not but that something for the fbi and the special counsel to decide and like you said earlier in your post let see where it goes ,4,PoliticalHumor
SoldierZulu,the funny part to me at least is that the aliens seem to mainly be confined to their tripods which any decently intelligent human would assume are pressurized with whatever atmospheric mix they breathe even if the atmosphere could have been breathable for them however many millions of years ago they planted the tripods it would have changed drastically over time and this apparent world conquering species that is very patient and has been doing this for longer than we can comprehend does not have to pressurize their artificial environments bullshit pressurized self contained atmospheres likely from an atmospheric generator of some kind would not allow in viruses and bacteria this is a really fucking dumb and plot armorish advanced species only perhaps matched by the stupidity of the aliens in signs ,4,Damnthatsinteresting

SoldierZulu,a couple bucks in interest on a single year taxes and depending on income maybe but it not just about giving the government a loan it about exercising your freedom to do with that money as you please and over the years it does add up i have a coworker in his early 40s who got a 2 5k return this year and he bought a new tv with it says he loves tax season because he gets a bunch of money back to spend on something big this is not a guy who incapable of saving either he a spendthrift so the bad saver lets government hold his money because otherwise he will spend it explanation is out i think he truly just does not care at least he acted like it when i mentioned making adjustments this is dumb probably tens of thousands of dollars over the years if he simply did a little bit of research and adjusted his taxes he could put more away in his 401k and get some extra in his paychecks for saving or spending it could be his emergency fund it might even save his family one year in the event of owing a catastrophic amount for medical a destroyed car etc he has freedom with that money and if he truly wanted to he could take it and invest it and earn way more back on it over the years than he lent the government people do not get wealthy by ignoring financial advantages available to them no matter how insignificant they may seem ,1,funny

SoldierZulu,hmm maybe i am not sure what i am seeing then in the 4th picture i scrolled to on my device it looks like the sticker overlaps the bottom left corner on the right side battery while i see no sticker edges on the left one that overlap is suspicious like someone put a sticker over it that was not even cut to the same size if that overlapping edge is actually the sticker i am curious why it oversized and it makes me suspicious that it hiding something underneath edit the model numbers are different when i google the one that ends in bbe i can find other official oem batteries with that same exact overlap sold from reputable sellers when i google the bbu i find the same links it seems there are 3 different official models of this battery and they are all interchangeable you may not have a fake after all and it possible that you are just seeing small differences in how the three different models were manufactured at this point i do not think we can tell just from the exterior the blurry sticker is a little suspect but a printing error is somewhat plausible slight differences could be due to them being different models of the same battery you are not going to learn more until you actually do some real battery tests on it or really if you feel it safe then pop it in your note 4 and run battery analysis on it several good in depth battery and system hardware analysis apps can do this it will easily tell you if it the 3220mah it supposed to be usually in the worst case scenario with these fakes they are just lower power rated than they claim to be i doubt it gonna blow up or anything and now i have done way more research on this than i ever intended good luck ,1,samsung

SoldierZulu,heh it funny because i have been an android user for 2 years and i never saw the blobs my wife uses ios i have been seeing samsung emoji icon set the whole time and it actually not half bad in fact almost as good as the ios icons so really this wo not change anything for me unless samsung decides to swap to google set and that is actually entirely possible when they move to o now that i think about it ugh replacement emoji packs are thankfully a thing ,2,Android

SoldierZulu,for those looking for another fix besides blocking the ad server this is from avsforum extra feature has been on the tv since the beginning you can even bring up the extra menu with the dedicated button the tvs remote after owning it the tv for a month or so i got tired of that pop up and so i reset my tv and decided not to agree to any of the samsung terms and policies etc and since then i have been free of not only that extra pop up but other advertisements in their smart hub so if you soft reset your tv and do not agree to any of the tos the tv still apparently works fine but you do not get served ads or the extra pop ups anymore presumably suggestion pop ups for apps not sure what he means i will have to look at my tv i may not even have that since he mentions a dedicated button for it on the remote big however if you have a model with voice commands i do not the poster notes that the voice commands will no longer work if you do not agree to the tos so that may be a deal breaker for some i am still trying to find the ad server but i may eventually try this and report back if i do i just do not want to have to calibrate the damn thing again ,1,samsung

SoldierZulu,ohhh i just looked at the 4th picture again and noticed that the label is actually applied as a sticker on the suspect battery and not printed directly onto the materials that leads me to believe it is a fake quality fake though i am wondering if they actually used the shell from a real samsung battery that was perhaps no longer functioning edit can you use a plastic scraper or xacto knife to carefully lift the sticker and peel it back a bit to see what is underneath dying to know now ,1,samsung

SoldierZulu,so the dude is probably both ugly and has a shitty personality he still going to be those things in japan you cannot escape yourself if all he wants is to get laid why does not he just hire a prostitute he can spend probably close to 5 figures for a month in japan but cannot afford a hooker if we are being pragmatic i mean it really the best way to go man this is just sad cringe on many levels ,91,SubredditDrama

SoldierZulu,it almost a form of economic eugenics poor and sick get sicker and die wealthy stay strong and live long if only that was as far as it went but the real kicker of this bill is that it fucks the middle class too i might not be able to get or keep coverage after it passes and my family earns six figures in an area with a very modest cost of living however my cancer treatment is 40k per month do you think a six figure income means anything up against costs like that yes you can negotiate these amounts down to a certain extent but let me explain how i was diagnosed the very first person i met after my doctor told me i had cancer was the treatment network financial advisor the real purpose here is to find out if you have insurance first of all and then to find out what your plan will cover and how much you will likely need to pay yourself it just a basic estimate based on common treatment regimens for your specific cancer but i guess the purpose is to prepare you for what you are about to spend i am thankful for my plan every day i am in treatment even though i know our system can be better and i still should not have to be paying so much but this plan was introduced as an aca program and now it might go away my health cannot afford a disruption in treatment i need this plan and i need the protections of the aca to make it through this goddammit we need single payer and we need it yesterday and these guys are giving us the opposite those motherfuckers ,11,fakehistoryporn

SoldierZulu,this is not my first rodeo as i went through a long term illness about a decade ago so i am doing my due in appealing and attempting to negotiate the issue with the private sa company is that they were hired not by the surgeon or hospital but a hospital affiliate they billed the surgeon and because they are private and for profit and not part of the facility they can do whatever they want if insurance does not pay i was pretty confident my insurance would side with me but i believe the sa company refused to negotiate and did something to make my insurer angry they are also very antagonistic on the phone and refused to negotiate after i lost my appeal they are pieces of shit in my book and i cannot wait to be done with them i am already going through the appeals process on the scans and my medical oncologist is standing his ground and adamant that these scans were necessary because the pet did actually find a spot on my liver that was not found in any other scans again i am hoping my insurance will side with me and my doctor and again who knows i have 6 different doctors and i get treated at 3 different facilities with additional specialist visits all over the friggin state shit crazy i am sure i will be able to get it all down to a reasonable amount but like i said it still likely to be 5 figures i am only 1 4 of the way through my treatment oh and my out of pocket maximum is 3000 but there are also loopholes here there are some fees that wo not count towards this and are charged on a per visit basis my radiation therapy visits for example all had fees that did not count towards out of pocket many of my lab fees do not count either so yes i still contend that america healthcare system is fucked when it starts to sound like a goddamn comcast bill ,1,politics

SoldierZulu,monoprice should have cheap quality ones otherwise i would get anker like you said all of my anker chargers and cables have been top quality ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,there are a few reasons why i owe so much 1 when they first found my cancer a few months ago they ordered a ton of scans and scope procedures to get a better look at it my insurance deemed that some of the scans were unnecessary because they had either been done too close to each other or the scan was not typically used to look at my specific disease they denied a total of 3 scans and the pet alone is 15 000 i will eventually negotiate these down but they will still cost me a lot of money 2 during my first surgery unknown to me at the time my surgeon hired the services of a private surgical assistance company when the surgeon got the 4500 bill from them he sent it to my insurance but they denied coverage because the company was out of network i have already lost my appeal on this one and i cannot negotiate it down 3 there are many hidden insurance costs such as lab fees facility fees and others and then there is also the money spent on co pays for every single thing this is also already in the low thousands i am only 4 months in to what will likely be a year long treatment plan my insurance plan is actually considered a very good one by national standards the us healthcare system is fucked ,1,politics
SoldierZulu,i hope i can still use it this year i have a great plan and my treatment is still going to be in the 10s of thousands just this year alone ,1,politics
SoldierZulu,and me as well if my cancer treatment becomes more long term than it already has been yes they literally want to pass a law that will cause me to lose my current insurance while being unable to get new insurance my treatments can be a quarter million a year i will die ,10,politics

SoldierZulu,i always had it set to gesture so that was never an issue i think samsung is just spending too long waiting for a second click and that the cause of the delay the phone is certainly fast enough to instantly go to the home screen maybe someone will figure out a setting for this or an app to adjust it if necessary ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,games often adjust their resolution automatically regardless of your screen resolution so that not an issue at all ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,double clicking is a placebo nobody sure why but you have to press the button extremely quickly to get it to register current theory is they plan to add some sort of hold or double click functionality but it not tied to anything yet the reason double clicking seems to be what works is because you are pressing and releasing it so fast ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i would replace it it worries me that there are phones that simply do not suffer from it like mine ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,phew thankfully i have had neither of these problems ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,what no the phone is like 5 days old and it an aspect ratio that nobody uses it going to take months but until then just use the various full screen options samsung knew this would be an issue at first and that why you can scale stuff in a lot of different ways i know it crops stuff out but i doubt you will see 18 5 9 video content as a standard for years for example you are an early adopter this is what it like to be one ,3,GalaxyS8

SoldierZulu,yeah it has that on by default and it annoying there an option you have to check to fit email to screen and then it behaves properly edit the setting is auto fit and its in message view ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,there was a lot of buzz that samsung had significantly improved its battery tech with the s8 i do not know if that true or not but then the difference would make sense or they are just fudging their numbers by redefining what normal use is ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,nope i wrote up a whole thread about it here https www reddit com r galaxys8 comments 67as1p samsungs email app what were they thinking there no way to mark read from notifications and i consider it a critical failure of the app in the end i chose aquamail it really configurable you can even set what buttons you want in the notification like mark read delete reply and i was able to theme it to look just like my phone pixel theme its overall look with the right configuration material light style custom colors whitespace and font settings reminds me a lot of the samsung app and even has nice clean notifications thumbing between emails is also really nice it supports multiple accounts and a configurable smart folder that can have custom rules and has a combined account view try it out man i think you will like it edit just be prepared to tweak stuff to get it to look the way you want there are a lot of visual settings but to me that a good thing it means when i eventually get bored of the way it looks i can change it again edit 2 if you do not like its icon and name download awesome icons and create a new shortcut i was able to give it the same icon and name as the default samsung mail app ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i believe the 2016 model is but you need the adapter elbow joint with a usb c port that pops in and out of the gearvr some people have reported they got the wrong adapter with the older ones a straight one instead of elbow joint but you can contact samsung to get the correct adapter if you are talking about the white 2015 model or anything earlier no those wo not work at all they are micro usb only ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i have not received mine yet but the shipping notification says it includes an oculus digital content bonus so it probably just a promo code on a card ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,no the two remappers that are currently the best bxactions and custom bixby button do not do that when an app launches it triggers a listener event that what these remapper apps are using to detect and kill it before launching your custom action ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,no the very first remappers used a polling method but now they use listener events to detect when the bixby app launches should be basically zero performance impact cbc even has an option to use the old polling method so you can see the difference bxactions is actually very fast same with cbc ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,that does not make sense a lot of apps use accessibility including built in ones the only thing i can think of is that one of those remappers had some sort of polling to detect the press because otherwise everything else is event based and should not slow anything down ,1,GalaxyS8

SoldierZulu,you do not know how much of a hard on the evangelical religious get over pregnancy and childbirth they want more kids even if the parents cannot take care of them they do not give a shit about the kid post birth but boy do they catch the vapors when a woman is pregnant or going through the miracle of childbirth bitches that no miracle it the most imperative biological drive on earth and literally almost anyone and anything alive can do it but i digress fuck the politicians and religious special interest groups that fight free easy access to birth control and sex education america sexual taboo and sexual obstructionism can be blamed entirely on one group and they can go fuck themselves or each other and do us all a favor ,1,PublicFreakout

SoldierZulu,these are my stats for just one day of use 100megs of ads and data collection bullshit blocked https imgur com a v4vhg jpg edit i also use the adguard and adblock for samsung internet browser extensions because some stuff does slip through the cracks on the web but with all 3 active it bulletproof ,3,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i mean i am on the latest version of youtube and like i said i am not the only one with this problem see this thread for example https www reddit com r galaxys8 comments 674k59 1440p on youtube also why do your quality selection options look so different than mine and others almost looks like desktop controls as someone else in that thread stated it appears some people can but nobody knows why it not an urban myth at all ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i am in the official youtube app on my s8 and i cannot choose 1440p60 there was another thread about this where others had the same results unless you know a way to enable it that i do not the most it lets me choose is 1440p30 but 1440p60 is never an option ,3,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,there no option for 1440p60 on that video there currently some issue that prevents that option from being selected on s8s ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,bxactions and custom bixby button appear to be equally as fast and responsive custom bixby button has more actions but bxactions also has an option to bind it to the camera which cbc does not seem to have the toggle ringer mode action in cbc does not seem to work properly either as it just takes me to the do not disturb settings page give them both a try and see which one you like best ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,great work just as fast and responsive as bxactions more actions available too are you planning to add more ive been looking for one with a mute toggle option this toggles silent in the current volume channel but none seem to have that option i also noticed that yours does not have the ability to remap it to the camera which is pretty nice in bxactions i just want more actions would a wqhd qhd resolution toggle be possible i would pay for a pro version if it got me more actions to configure ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,it the shitty way samsung implemented the button after they bypassed the accessibility layer you have to press it really quickly or sometimes it does not respond at all ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i just want a mute toggle it really all i want although a resolution toggle would be awesome as well ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,corners on these things seem really fragile make sure you get a case with some corner cushioning ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,you know it in a way i have survived worse i have been in critical condition twice in my life what is another near death scare my treatment is going well and i have no doubt i will beat it ,18,GetMotivated
SoldierZulu,there no microsoft apps with at t you get something called hancom office instead which actually is not that bad not great but decent for interacting with microsoft file types ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,oddly enough i was able to completely uninstall facebook on my s8 which i have never been able to do before anything else i come across with no uninstall or disable option i use pdp for disabling stubborn apps in pdp is perfectly safe ,0,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,that does not mean pdp is not without its uses it can disable apps that samsung or carriers do not give you a disable option for and it perfectly safe for that it when you start to mess with processes and services that things get screwy ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i just rebound it to a dedicated camera button in bxactions never even see the thing now ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,that is one of the really good applications of pdp any apps samsung or at t for some reason do not give a disable option can be safely disabled in pdp i have had to do it for samsung email and internet apps lookout i think i was just able to disable normally on my s8 ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,where are you seeing this what web page i mean edit never mind that the desktop version of the offer check page ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,lol no mine says 6 to 8 weeks but i was just approved saturday ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,anyway i have switched to aquamail it really configurable and i can get it to look and act a lot like samsung mail app except i can configure what buttons are on the notification which is super nice reply delete mark read all i ever asked for great app great interface and i am sure i will shell out a few bucks for pro after a couple days use ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,nope just reply ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,that the exact client i was using before and i may go back i am trying a whole bunch of different ones from the play store and it amazes me how featureless most of them are ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,have not tried it have no desire to i am on a hunt for a good clean free email app now i was never a huge fan of typeapp due to its aesthetics but it had a good feature set gotta be the best of both worlds somewhere ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,ah i thought the i am waiting for the good times now sounded kinda ominous poor guy i know firsthand how awful cancer is my wife has already seen me lose 30 pounds i was not overweight and it really the impression that you are wasting away that so terrifying for you and those around you ,349,GetMotivated
SoldierZulu,hmm does this affect any other features like password payment info saving ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i did not notice it at first but the beta has much smoother scrolling on long pages with a lot of images the other is that the beta has a floating quick actions bubble which lets you do things like resize website text i do not notice much of a difference beyond that ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i get hundreds per day that are often work related that just need to be read and not replied to i can often read the important bits by pulling down the notification previously used typeapp for this then i tap mark read in the notification and i no longer have a ton of unread messages in the box it extremely handy when you need to cycle through a lot of emails ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,what if i long press the notification it just takes me to the app notification settings i am trying to mark an email as read from the notification without going into the app ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,no shit that awesome i bet there tons more of this stuff that i do not know oh well bixby button is back to being a dedicated camera button for now really just want to bind it to either wqhd qhd resolution swapping or a mute toggle though ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,and yet sometimes one press will open it just fine if it doing something behind the scenes that changes the number of presses required on a context by context basis then that even worse either way it just feels buggy and unresponsive and i am not sure that you are correct it actually really hard to determine just from a bit of googling how many presses it supposed to take to activate it pre patch it only took one and was very responsive even the user manual does not say how many presses it makes me wonder if samsung still could not really decide and so they just left out any mention of it in official statements or documentation and does nobody else think that having a hardware button that can only be double clicked and nothing else is incredibly dumb hell i do not need to double click the power button and that turns my whole screen off and locks my phone yeah not buying the accidental activation excuse i think samsung just fucked up ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i use adguard and adblock for samsung internet direct comparisons show that adguard blocks more than any of the others i tried and it passes almost all the adblock test sites adblock for samsung internet i added because there was one test adguard did not pass i doubt you need anything else but those 2 ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,it does but it been spotty unfortunately i supplement it with adblock for samsung honestly while it good for working in other apps if you do not already use a vpn on your phone you are better off with adguard or adhell as disconnect mostly focuses on trackers and data collection unless it goes on sale for a decent price i managed to snag it during a free promotional period i do not think it currently worth the price ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,it seems to have problems with youtube ads due to the way they keep changing how they are delivered pretty sure it cannot block them now definitely blocks ingame ads though and i have not seen an app get past it so far ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,in terms of power and speed efficiency it way better it pretty close in terms of what it will block to adhell but does not need to mess with vpn looping to achieve it like either of those two i would do some research there plenty of info on it on the disconnect site edit it also made specifically for galaxy phones and uses the built in samsung knox security system for its blocking engine it really is the best blocker for galaxy phones and the price reflects that ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu, and you see johnny a bill becomes a law after a corporation gives the people that vote on laws an exact draft of a law they want and then they give those lawmakers tens of thousands of other bills to make them vot but bill why are they giving them so many other bills i thought that you just need one bill to make a law those are a different kind of bill johnny those are dollar bills they have a magical way of making politicians pass laws that they not only barely read if at all but actually completely fuck over people like you and your friends and your mommy and daddy they do not give a shit about us okay johnny the republicans have not known how to govern for a decade and so they take money and vague bills authored by corporations and pass them into law and when they need it to happen faster they just go to their vegetable of a president and have him sign whatever they want that how bills become law johnny and how executive orders become some shitty pseudo law that not even the turnip currently posing as president himself seems able to grasp the maximum breadth of wow bill that sounds really goddamn shitty i thought bills were supposed to be written based on the will of the people the constituents who they represent i guess it time to just hang them all from razor wire from the dome of the capitol as a reminder for all prospective future piece of shit politicians that decide their bosses are the corporations and money and greed and not the people mmhm mhmm johnny but i am just a bill up on capitol hill ,1,MarchAgainstTrump

SoldierZulu,ok man could you reply here or dm me if it going to be a couple weeks the chemo and pain pills really affect my short term memory and it a good app that i will gladly pay for when that update goes live ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i used package disabler pro i can turn it back on if i want pdp is a really useful app for disabling built in apps that strangely samsung does not let you disable i would not use it for any of its other features though like disabling processes or services because that can really fuck up your phone stick to disabling stubborn apps though and you are fine ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,nice man thanks for the tip ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i use bxactions to remap the bixby button to last used app and it is a godsend for multitasking when you need to move often between two full screen apps give it a shot man it even works after they patched out the previous ability to remap you have to have bixby enabled though it does not actually catch the button press it detects when the bixby process runs and then immediately kills it then does your custom action ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,you know i actually really like my properly themed touchwiz it snappy and it organizes things in a way i like i did change to a swiftkey keyboard with a dark theme and made it smaller because fuck that default keyboard but other than that i am mostly stock on interface my dark pixel theme with custom wallpapers just looks and feels great ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,they are really great definitely my earbuds of choice when i am not in the mood for my over ears ,24,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,second one is way too thick on the edges my wife has the first one on her iphone 6s and it a great case buttons are free floating and nice and clicky does scratch scuff really easy though just fyi might want to replace it every 6 months like she does because it just looks dirty and ruins the clarity after enough regular use you will see i have ordered 3 spigen cases so far spigen liquid crystal galaxy s8 plus case https www amazon com dp b06xp4qy2b ref cm sw r cp apap l1esrmt4seapo spigen thin fit galaxy s8 plus case with sf coated non slip matte surface black https www amazon com dp b06xp4lghj ref cm sw r cp apap yqdyxihodk9r9 spigen air skin galaxy s8 plus case black https www amazon com dp b06xp5jsrl ref cm sw r cp apa oky ybyw997m0 i have only had the chance to try the first two and the liquid crystal case sucks the buttons are not separate from the rubberish case and they are mushy i wo not deal with mushy buttons ordered the thin fit instead and it better but the material is a cheap hard plastic that reminds me of lower quality android phones or the older s2 s3 models there are also breaks in the corners so you can snap it in because the plastic is so hard and it kinda ruins the rounded flowing aesthetic the hard plastic cutouts on the bottom for ports and such cut into my fingers when the phone rests on it and that sucks the areas for buttons are cut out completely which is really nice since i like direct access to buttons definitely better than the crystal still not great at all the third gets here tomorrow and i will review it when it does it still has cutouts for the buttons which i like but they are smaller which means more protection which i also like the material also has no corner breaks and it very thin while also tinted black and partially transparent so hopefully some of the shine and aesthetics come through the best part about it for me that i think i will like the most is that the entire bottom is cut out so i can rest my phone more comfortably on my fingers i know it almost practically just a skin on the back since it so thin but it has adequate corner protection and i take good care of my phones main goal is to avoid scratches and the occasional light fall if the last one does not work out i will just get a transparent neo hybrid first one you linked not op i at least know the quality of that case i just wanted something a bit thinner this time around oh well ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i am on us at t snapdragon s8 i cannot see the 1440p60 option in that second video either 1080p60 only and i am running in wqhd resolution it has to be some sort of bug or oversight because that crap ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,what the actual fuck how is this anything revolutionary samsung how is this a legitimate demonstration of your supposed al abilities and using pinterest of all things as your search resource this is bullshit are there any uses for bixby that are worth actually having it tied to a button yet how could they launch this thing in such a state when it has a dedicated hardware button to say it a disappointment is an understatement ,4,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i would like the option to give it a transparency setting not render it at all and just respond to hard presses and another option to make it so that it defaults to hidden unkess you swipe up from the bottom of the screen the last one i want the most but transparency would be be great too first person that makes an app that can do these two things gets my money ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i registered mine in muted indoor daylight and they are almost always recognized even in darkness i have had them fail to register twice and it was when i was going from a light to dark area but no biggie it still insanely fast and really feels futuristic i am sure future updates will make it even better ,3,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,yes you can pick just about any of the android bluetooth controllers on amazon with decent reviews old ps3 controllers work as well i believe ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i know man it amazing i even have aod on i use a dark theme pixel which also aids with battery life but seriously it a juggernaut just lasts forever with my constant use and it could probably go a week on standby ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i have aod on and it does not seem to make a dent in the battery last night i left on my nightstand charged to 100 unplugged and it was 98 when i woke up about 6 hours later for the amount of use i get out of it that is a tiny sacrifice they really did optimize it well ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,nope samsung browser has fingerprint payment info autofill and fingerprint website login also has fingerprint protected secret mode ,10,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,of which they are the motherfucking kings of ,6,subredditoftheday
SoldierZulu,does not even work with a baseball hat it dumb they should let us record multiple face profiles like they do with fingerprints ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,samsung internet beta it on the play store and galaxy apps store super fast and the features are fantastic the floating quick access bubble is awesome i use the website text resize feature a ton you can also install adblockers as extensions and even have more than one active at once i think it the best android browser hands down and i have tried a lot it been my goto browser for over a year now seriously the smoothest scrolling i have ever seen in android ,24,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,right brainfarted for a sec uv is a different spectrum of sunlight so of course a uv coating would only block it and nothing else but the stronger the tint the worse ir should perform or having sunglasses with a partially reflective coating would certainly have an effect ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,yup shit you not without contacts or glasses i can only make out fine details about 6 inches from my face after that it drastically degrades to colored shapes and shadows ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,bxactions works just fine i am on the latest update from samsung they have a new version of the app out today that detects the press in a different way i have it set to last used app and it is really handy for quick app swapping i do it a lot when multitasking and it way faster than using the app list try it out note that samsung did something fucky to the button when they bypassed accessibility in the patch it incredibly unresponsive even without a remapper app like bxactions i almost always have to tap it twice to get it to respond which is ridiculous that what they get for rushing a quick fix for something nobody wanted or asked for i have a feeling samsung will fix the unresponsiveness in the next update if we are really lucky they will add it back to the accessibility layer super unlikely but one can hope ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,sunlight is partially infrared radiation is it not ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,mine are pretty high end polarized sunglasses with a reflective gradient i am 99 sure they wo not work but that no biggie still guess i can give it a shot ,1,GalaxyS8

SoldierZulu,i wear 8 00 but the frames are quite small which creates more of a warp effect i think ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,seems likely luckily i only wear glasses about 10 of the time and it works fine with my contact lenses ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,disconnect in the galaxy apps store it incredibly expensive but it blocks all ads even in apps and does not require root or vpn looping which causes problems for me since i use an actual vpn connection on my phone ,4,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i would not even try this good lock does stuff to core system files in systemui and i would not take any chances ,3,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,yes but that not the same as just muting a standard mute api call will just mute whatever audio channel is the current one so if i hit it in a video it should only mute the media channel and if i hit it on the home screen it should just mute ringtone that the mute toggle functionality i am looking for any key gestures had this when it still worked pre remap patch toggle silent but i have not found it in any of the newer remap apps ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,facial recognition fails to recognize my face an awful lot for whatever reason with glasses or a baseball hat on but man the iris scanner is fantastic i did not expect it to be so fast i have disabled facial recognition entirely yeah i still have to lift my glasses up for the iris scanner but i can start to pull them halfway up my face and the iris scanner will pick up on it as soon as my eyes are even partly visible this shit really does feel like the future and worse comes to worst i just use fingerprint or pattern ,14,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,lol yes it was 118 apps i have quite a few that made it over from the switch copy from my s6 ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,as an aside are there any benefits to using samsung internet beta on the play store over the stable app on my s8 i see the beta is a couple versions ahead anyone with hands on experience that can tell me if it worth installing the beta over stable ,1,Android
SoldierZulu,if your animation setting is at low it will reduce the fx on some weapons and legendaries possibly other items put it at medium or high ,2,Guildwars2

SoldierZulu,could you explain better i do not know what this means i could not figure out a way to apply it only to the lock screen either also it would be kinda nice if you could adjust the scale of the box when choosing the area of your image i would not mind packing a bit more pixels into the sample ,3,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,huh so that what that is i set it to screen off only it much better with the standard style when the phone in use ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i mean i agree the battery life is fantastic and i am running it in wqhd resolution right now 3 hours of constant use and i have only lost 22 and i have been doing a bunch of stuff watching videos playing a game reading reddit messing around with bixby remappers etc my s6e would probably be at about 30 right now but that was not really what i was commenting in it was the app optimizer i have not ever seen that notification so i am guessing i just have to wait a bit while it does its thing ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu, i used the bixby remapper app to bind it to open the camera it makes much more sense than just having a dead button besides having a dedicated camera button is pretty nice edit use bxactions instead it much faster and i have now bound it to open last used app it insanely handy only wish they had a toggle mute action but no rebinding app seems to have that yet ,2,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,it looks really good but i could not see how to apply it only to the lock screen refunded the app until i can i really do not want animated wallpaper on my home screen ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,just curious i had an s6e for a couple years and never saw this message my experience went in reverse the phone started out holding a charge forever but after a couple months it was much worse but i could do a factory reset restore all my apps and settings and i would be back to great battery life but only for a couple months so then it would be rinse and repeat i have had my s8 for 3 days and have not gotten that message i suppose i just continue to wait is there a settings page anywhere that controls it or gives more info i am a logs data whore ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i am super wary of burn in after using my s6e for about 2 5 years once it started to occur i switched as many apps as i could to black themes is that the correct thing to do to reduce burn in did the same thing for the keyboard by installing swiftkey and using a black style on my s6e i started to notice the title bar from relay the keyboard and the status bar burning in after about 1 5 years the relay bar was blue and the keyboard white now that i have my s8 i want to make sure the same thing does not happen my biggest concern is the status bar because many apps change its color to something gaudy and bright and i am worried it going to cause similar burn in on my s8 can the navbar be set to hidden and accessible by swiping up i have not looked yet but that would surely help if you could change the nav buttons to another texture every couple months it might alleviate it personally i would like to black out the back and app list buttons like i did on the s6e i know they are there and do not need them rendered i have concerns about how they change the navbar to be context sensitive such as in games though if i cannot rely on those invisible buttons being in the same place every time then not rendering them wo not be an option edit oh and thanks for the heads up on package disabler i have been one of its biggest supporters for quite some time since i would originally used it to nuke the built in facebook bloat on my s6e which did indeed save me quite a bit of battery life but i can understand from a technical standpoint how many processes would not benefit from it being a software engineer you would think i would know better but the best part about being an engineer is that there always more to discover cheers mate ,1,GalaxyS8

SoldierZulu,i have installed it and it does indeed work after they patched out the previous ability to remap the only thing i have really found it useful for is opening the camera though because it has to pause whatever app is currently open run due to actually running bixby briefly still it a great first attempt and having a dedicated camera button is pretty nice thanks man also will this stay enabled after a reboot ,1,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,i really wish that i could bind the bixby button to resolution swap that would be perfect ,3,GalaxyS8
SoldierZulu,some of them yes they are controlled by the animation setting as weird as that is if you have it set to anything below medium some weapon fx especially legendary weapons with trails will not appear it very noticeable on my frostfang ,3,Guildwars2

SoldierZulu,i have been using samsung browser for about a year and love it for a couple reasons 1 it takes multiple content blockers so i do not have to deal with ads 2 it very fast easily the fastest of the more powerful corporate browsers 3 smart lock has been around for a bit in samsung internet but now it works with other android apps as well at least on my s8 this saves logins and passwords and lets you login with a universal password or fingerprint 4 can save payment info like chrome and integrates well with your google account uses a universal password or fingerprints to access them 5 great design and interface tab switching is faster and better than chrome i cannot live without the bottom navigation bar anymore 6 secret mode same as incognito can be password or fingerprint protected 7 desktop mode is a lifesaver when you are stuck with a shitty mobile site and other minor things i cannot think of a single thing in chrome i like over samsung browser ,9,Android

SoldierZulu,this is the absolutely wrong way to look at it and anyone who does is doing themselves a disservice overbooking allows them to keep profits up this in no way benefits the consumer and let not pretend they could not afford the small loss of profit to provide a superior experience do you know why the united incident is barely costing them money because airlines have such historically low customer satisfaction since 9 11 that these incidents barely register as a blip in a few weeks their stock will fully recover how is that acceptable to anyone in their right mind stand up for yourself for fucking once and admit that you deserve better stop advocating for victimhood ,1,canada
