MerrilyContrary,i am in a similar situation played 1 year of hs water polo after i quit swimming at 14 about to turn 29 14 years out of water my endurance has taken maybe a month to come back to a place where i feel confident doing a masters workout as written my local team does around 3 000 yards during a 75 minute workout so that what i try to do on my own i was never very fast to begin with and so i am less worried about the pace of my individual laps i just focus on shorter rests and keeping my intensity up i have the feeling that i will be low to middle of the pack once i start practicing with a team but it where i need to be if i want to get faster ,3,Swimming
MerrilyContrary,i had been doing the same 3 workouts over and over for a few weeks mostly just trying to build enough endurance to do a couple miles in a reasonable time this week i typed up a few masters workouts from swimworkouts net and have been pushing myself to make the intervals i can definitely feel the difference in intensity and i am confident that i can improve my times now that i am focusing on them ,1,Swimming
MerrilyContrary,hey so i am autistic or i have aspergers depending on how you want to look at the diagnostic criteria and i have always had terrible problems with self esteem and bullying people on my team looking back these were the girls who were trying to force me to the bottom of the pecking order i was cute but too weird were vile to me and did not want me to succeed while simultaneously berating me for failing to meet their high standards honestly i quit swimming because i could not feel like a valuable member of my team even though i loved being in the water i would like to imagine that the right words of wisdom or a pep talk from my present 29 year old self might have helped but i was too caught up in trying to mesh with the toxic social dynamic of my team i was happier on a year round team but my family could not afford it if it financially viable for you it might be preferable to swimming in a summer league or hs team i found that the year round team was more about improving than winning points at meets especially since i could just opt out of them by refusing to sign up and nobody was mad at me for being the swimmer i was now that i am an adult swimming for myself on my own time i am just happy to be improving i am happy to feel good about my body i am proud to tell people that i swim if you can find that feeling then you are golden even if you are just participating which is all i have ever managed to do ,3,Swimming

MerrilyContrary,unless the coach has told you that you cannot join the team just join swimming on a team is how i learned to swim faster and most of the high school teams that i have heard of will accept beginners unless they are full even if you cannot join for whatever reason you could ask to swim at their practices then you would gain the benefit of practicing with a coach and other swimmers who might be willing to give you tips even though you would not be competing at meets good luck ,7,Swimming

MerrilyContrary,i looked up some generic workouts and after swimming each one i would add things on double parts of the set that did not feel challenging split things up that i did not feel like i had the endurance for now i am at a point where i have got pretty regular sets for mon wed and tues thur and i do random stuff like flipturns on friday all three are right at the edge of my ability level and i am working on getting them done with shorter rests not full on intervals yet just endurance and stroke development that i am trying to crunch down into an hour by spending less time on the wall ,1,Swimming
MerrilyContrary,i liked the first 2 books for sure but i feel like the third is where the prose and romance become overbearing i have always enjoy stories where learning a series of practical skills is the key to character development but it got formulaic eventually and it did not feel as exciting it almost like she was trying to make each book passable as a stand alone and so she had to reiterate for new readers rather than building for an existing audience ,2,books
MerrilyContrary,i am in my second month of swimming again after a 14 year hiatus i have seen huge improvement in that time swimming about 3 500 yards 5x a week where i was only swimming 1 000 yards per session my first week back i have looked at my local masters team website and it looks like they regularly do about 3 000 yards per hour long practice whereas it takes me between 1 5 and 2 hours right now depending on what i am working on that day i am looking to get my time down between now and january before i pay for masters although i am sure i could drag my ass through one of their practices at my current level and welcome home i feel so comfortable in the water i am a little sad it took me so long to get back in ,1,Swimming

MerrilyContrary,the mechanism for feedback is literally just backwash the baby has to create a vacuum to nurse and after every pull a little milk mixed with saliva is sucked back into the nipple with nutrient content it got more to do with the frequency of nursing and the time of day when my body is producing melatonin my baby gets some too that actually why the recommendation is to feed pumped breast milk at about the same time of day it was initially expressed there are some things iron being a primary example that are not provided in significant quantities via breast milk an infant will be born with about enough iron to make it through the first six months of life before they begin eating solid foods ,5,askscience

MerrilyContrary,i stopped having fun when i was about to move to the 15 18 age group and i was sure high school swim would be even worse than my summer team i decided to try water polo and while it was a nice change of pace it was certainly no less competitive all the same ass bags who picked on me before now in high school i opted out of a second year even though i earned my jv letter as a freshman it been 14 years and i am just finally getting back in the water this time because it what i want i swim the sets because i want to swim them i skip intervals that i cannot do or alter them because i wrote the sets it exciting again and i am really looking forward to getting back on a team once i feel ready i am realizing that the people who were mean to me or made rude comments on my body or my speed dedication were just trying to bring me down to lift themselves up why would a fast swimmer need me to feel bad about not finishing a set why would a coach need me to feel lazy for plateauing your parents might chill out if they feel like you are staying true to your athletic identity by staying in the water even if it a different sport if not waste their money 2k16 if they want to pay for you to sit in the locker room in a 50 practice suit that their problem edit to add if you have an annual sports physical coming up that can be a good time to talk to your doctor about your anxiety and panic attacks without needing to convince your parents that there something wrong your school counselor can also probably write you a referral i know they do for learning disabilities if they still wo not listen try keeping a daily mood journal where you track things like relative happiness how many panic attacks you are having and what is causing them eg just thinking about swimming thinking about your performance that day people commenting on your swimming or appearance being timed only when you are very hungry thirsty etc if you do not think they will be too angry maybe even tell them that you are not attending practices anymore because of these feelings my flippant suggestion to waste their money is mostly just what i would have done because by the time i was 16 i was stubborn and full of rage and would literally have dared my parents to throw my ass in the pool 5 days a week if it was more important to them than my mental health ,5,Swimming

MerrilyContrary,thank you i am no expert but i have been working with children for about 8 years from 18 months to 6th grade depending on the year and most of that time was spent in a montessori environment actual curriculum aside the biggest take away message of my training was to follow the child this is the reason i try to avoid talking about chronological age when development is the topic that being said i do not know of a specific example of an older child without object permanence my thought process about the mirror neurons was that they allow us to correlate the facial features movements of other people to ourselves so i might know i have a nose by way of observing your nose my son does not yet have object permanence theory of mind or much language he 13 months but he touches his nose when i touch mine ,1,explainlikeimfive

MerrilyContrary,yes another good point adult generated fantasy is hard to distinguish from reality until the child is ready for abstract thought this is why pure montessori environments are strict about anthropomorphic characters stories that break physical laws and even things like dramatic play it must come from the child until somewhere around age 5 depending on the child ,2,explainlikeimfive

MerrilyContrary,there evidence that babies delivered vaginally are colonized by their mother microbes in a way that cesarean babies are not so clearly there are circumstances under witch these things can be said to intermingle that being said vaginal birth is a pretty extreme process and the muscles involved push everything out indiscriminately i am not as sure on this point but i have read that the microbes you are eating in yogurt or kombucha sp or whatever are actually food for the microbes in your gut not new residents ,0,explainlikeimfive
MerrilyContrary,my first thought was object permanence but it might have more to do with theory of mind basically children below a certain developmental age do not understand that other people have distinct thoughts and feelings independent of the child experience of reality one test of this is to determine whether the child recognizes their reflection in a mirror a mark is made on the child face before they are presented with a mirror if they touch the mark on the reflection as opposed to the actual mark on their face they have not internalized the distinction between their own mind and the minds of others another example is that pre theory of mind a child cannot understand that their favorite food is not your favorite food so if i did not know that i had a face except by way of mirror neurons and propreoception and looking in a mirror did not give me any discernible information about what my face looked like and i had no way to determine whether you were pretending maybe i really would believe that you had my nose eta in developmentally average children theory of mind will be pretty firm around 3 4 years older children are either humoring you or are annoyed at your persistent tom foolery 2ndeta the lack of object permanence that makes peek a boo fun only lasts until about 2 years this means there is a brief window during which the child can understand the concept of having their nose taken but cannot understand that it on their face because they cannot see it and cannot determine whether you are pretending 3rdeta fixed specific age ranges tl dr developmentally normal children who understand the statement i have got your nose but who have not fully developed object permanence or theory of mind think you have got their nose ,66,explainlikeimfive

MerrilyContrary,let use wool as an example wool is hair and hair has a structure that rather scaly you will notice that a strand of hair will pull smoothly through your fingers in one direction but feel like it catches when pulled the other direction heat and moisture tend to make these scales open which leads to the fibers becoming tangled more easily add some soap and an agitator and you are on the road to making wool felt or a sweater fit for a sock puppet while wool is an extreme example other fibers can lock up like this too ,2,explainlikeimfive
