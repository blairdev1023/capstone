Jeremiahjd,i was referring to number 1 and seeing a faster cpu with lower core count is pretty common in intel world there a reason things like the devils canyon existed with few cores and higher clocks than say broadwell but yeah someone else hit on it its likely because amd doesnt have their own chip fab anymore going through global foundries and rather than designing a new node just for this they saved cost by repurposing a mobile type of node ,1,Amd
Jeremiahjd,what would be the significant design changes between intel 14nm node and global foundries that make one geared for mobile vs clock speeds cant be power draw right kaby lake has a tdp of 65w vs ryzen at 140 seems like amd took a shortcut instead of designing it for the correct market if thats the case still getting one tho lmao just kinda feel burned when my 5 year old fx 8120 oc stable to 4 6ghz and has been for 5 years ,-2,Amd

Jeremiahjd,so a few of your assumptions are askew what you are refering to is the many worlds theory which is not the same concept though might be connected to each other via string theory as the multiverse theory multiverse is a theory that opposes supersymmetry as a way of expanding the standard model of particles this is a part of particle physics and suggests that all aspects of a given universes physics depend on a number the cosmological constant multiverse theory suggests this number is random and different for each universe in the multiverse however at least in our universe if that constant changes even a little all the underlying laws of physics would not just be different but they would likely collapse therefore many of the universes in the multiverse may just be void or chaotic with no discernable structure of physical laws so nothing to form atoms and molecules etc with the many worlds explanation is what most people think of when talking about this it tries to explain a quantum mechanics behavior stating that a particle before being observed with exist in all possible states at once remember that part its important later until it is observed where the waveform collapses and the other unused possibilities dont cease to exist but rather fracture off into parallel worlds what all of this has to do with your question is that bit about particles existing in all possible states that is not to say that anything is possible based on the rest of the structure of the universe and the physics laws contained therein certain things would not be possible and thus there would not be a parallel world where it happens an example could be your question lets assume for a moment that we have discovered all the laws of physics in our universe and in that we discover that with our laws of physics multiversal travel is not possible that would mean that any universe with similar enough physics for a version of you homo sapiens exist likely would not have the physics needed to do multiversal travel so while there would be many worlds where you made various choices there would not exists worlds for everything you can think of if the physics were different enough from our own that multiversal travel was possible then it would seem unlikely for the physics to be similar enough for homo sapiens to evolve including you ,2,explainlikeimfive

Jeremiahjd,also when braking its much more about the technique and limits of physics than anything understanding how much room and how low of a speed you particular vehicle needs to make a maneuver like stopping or turning what most people do by mistake is apply the brakes too hard locking up their wheels even though most cars have abs they dont all respond the same way and can still lock up in very low traction conditions if your wheels lock up stop turning you cant steer making a successful turn in the snow then means finding a balance between momentum available traction speed and applied braking force braking hard enough to scrub enough speed before the turn but not so hard you skid or loose steering by going slow enough and stopping early enough to have the needed traction available ,1,explainlikeimfive
Jeremiahjd,exactly i lived in michigan for most of my life and had rwd fwd and awd vehicles if i had to choose fwd or awd fwd actually isnt too bad in getting moving but it really doesnt compare to awd i miss my truck lol but yeah those people are fools especially since awd trucks not so much cars weigh a lot more and thus are even harder to stop in slippery conditions but having 4x4 was nice as i could get around where others couldnt unplowed areas but it wasnt any better at stopping on roads ,1,explainlikeimfive
Jeremiahjd,as others have pointed out it gives 2x the potential traction it should be noted however that this only helps in acceleration and not with braking you already use all 4 tires to brake so just having awd or 4x4 is not going to make you invincible in the snow and ice like some people think ,2,explainlikeimfive

Jeremiahjd,its usually done with an app not sure if there is a real photographic technique for this might be the reason it makes things look miniature is because of what its doing with the focus and out of focus things on large scale objects a photograph would have very little difference in focus between the background content and extreme foreground tilt shift makes those differences more dramatic producing an optical illusion it tricks the brain into thinking its seeing something in miniature when its not ,1,pics

Jeremiahjd,the skydiving example makes more sense when you look deeper into what is actually taking place and mind you im not talking about people who just want to experience it once im talking about adrenaline junkies who get their kicks from things like sky diving base jumping etc the reason those activities feel good is because it engages your fight or flight reflex its simulated danger the fof reflex doesnt feel all that great until you over come it when the jump is over then you get a flood of dopamine that is what people are chasing taking drugs is no different just different paths to the same result a dopamine reward furthermore going back to anything that cause a dopamine reward by actions that arent naturally constructive thrill seeking would fall under this the fof reflex evolved to help us deal with real dangers yet skydiving for example is not a real threat unless something goes wrong obvi not like running from wolves or something so in the end its manipulating a body response to give you a dopamine reward in a situation it didnt evolve for specifically just like taking drugs its manipulating your bodily systems in a way that natural selection didnt cause in order to get a dopamine reward not saying drugs arent a shortcut just that many other things are as well ,1,Showerthoughts

Jeremiahjd,more or less but yeah its why light sources fade with distance radioactive materials decay sound gets quieter as it goes and things take effort energy to do natural degradation over time into more random and disordered states specifically ,2,explainlikeimfive
Jeremiahjd,this is about the 2nd law of thermal dynamics which states that over time any system in our universe tends towards increased entropy and not order this is seen played out on very basic levels such as a clock winding down never up on its own winding it up requires energy or say why we only see things shatter and crumble into more random pieces like a rock turning to gravel but we never see gravel spontaneously turning into solid rock unless again energy is expended this principle is why effect always follows cause reaction always follows action it defines the flow of time and causality ,2,explainlikeimfive
Jeremiahjd,soon https qz com 919819 giant neurons from the claustrum found wrapped around mouse brains could explain the biological origin of consciousness your arguments days are numbered ,1,todayilearned
Jeremiahjd,you could say this about any human activity that produces the dopamine reward yet has no other practical purpose other than the reward the brain reward system evolved to encourage constructive behavior ie drinking water when thirsty feels very satisfying and has a positive purpose yet skydiving produces the dopamine response but has no practical purpose technically its all emotional masturbation ,1,Showerthoughts
