ThatGuySlay,by uninstalling i would lose my saves right or are they stored somewhere ,1,fo4
ThatGuySlay,lol what a hostile response that was an example ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i honestly think everyone should master every god that comes out not only does it help you learn how to play the god it helps you play against it it helps you learn the abilities and how your enemy may use the abilities for instance you play thor and get level 5 and immediately look for a lane to gank if you are against a thor nearing level 5 you will know and think to yourself oh thor is almost 5 he probably gonna ult somewhere mastering every god will help you even if you do not like that god ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,this is online gaming no matter what game you go to you will find people who are bm rude you cannot avoid it if your teammates are calling you names and stuff find the reason for it and try to improve if they call you a noob for not rotating work on rotations ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you can easily get invaded and put far behind you can get ganked over and over easily you can get tower dove easily over and over your team will most likely have only 1 frontline god it could really hurt your team comp ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i guess they could still put the lan matches and swc matches on there they may have plans after that ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,well i mean in place of the vs it would be great to show stats if you have stats on ,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,he is ready to bail lol he loves the game still ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,wolfy is not on a team he is an advisor for noble esports which does not have a team for smite right now ,8,Smite
ThatGuySlay,people use more of a mage build with ao kuang so that they can get it get the kill and get out it more burst damage and it safer late game you can nearly one shot someone with polynomicon soul reaver and his passive building attack speed isnt really recommended on him anymore it may not be terrible now that his dragon call was buffed but alot of people still prefer mage kuang ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,this has been happening alot lately lol,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you can play them there but you will most likely get invaded ,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,16k worshippers and you do not realize how op his passive is lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yes i have multiple guardians legendary i know how much damage they do even while not having damage except for pen boots they do a ton of damage and they have a ton of utility ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,later on most guardians can kill a squishy easily sometimes nearly instantly ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,even later on ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,are you getting pen boots even before pen boots most of the guardians did a ton of damage besides sylvanus ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you should really get a recording software d i could recommend some if you have an actual graphics card ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,well people of the hindu religion were offended by kali zzz,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,oh not the ult p i mean just hopping on the web from her 3 ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have fun with arachne the best feeling is when you hop on that web at super speeds and kill a person within 2 seconds p a thing that i like to do with arachne is place a web at the start of the match where the enemy mid laner enters the lane they either go through the webs and waste potions or walk alllll the way around ,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ahh ok ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,pretty sure it would matter on vamana though ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,flat pen is always better unless they have some crazy magical defense x,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,why is that ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that a pretty good play nice job also it helps to put your 3 closer to you so that you get the speed buff faster another thing spear of the magus is pretty much always a better pen item than obsidian shard ,6,Smite
ThatGuySlay,pirate neith skin tone whew ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i cried lol ,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it a starter item it falls off big time the damage is lowered by protections ,2,Smite

ThatGuySlay,fat you mean glorious ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,wait you are not making sense why would i want to remove them hello ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,4head,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,hmm some people are saying it could be the freya banish someone also said they had the issue with janus portal ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,someone said they got the glitch around a kumbha mez i thought the banish was the issue too ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,when people complain about a god that was once op and they still want to nerf them into the ground ,9,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i had this exact same glitch posted it a bit earlier do not know what could have caused it ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,pretty much my reaction to everything lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,looks like the banish did it not sure though ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i thought about that lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea i have tried to recreate it not sure what really happened could be gamebreaking though lol i wonder if they would have stayed in my hand if i had not used my 2 ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i had his ult glitch out on me not sure if it was just a visual glitch or not but i still had the enemies in my hand after my ult finished ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,oh i know p mastery 6 vamana love playing him still ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would love to main vamana if i had old sprint 3 ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,solo kumbha can just combo you way easier now lol i really hate it i played kumbha vs kumbha against allied from afk and the burst was insane ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,please at least you did not have to lane against allied in solo lane in a kumbha mirror ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,how many buttons did you press to make this post ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,will hero now be your coach sub ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have played him in support and jungle i feel like he does not do much damage but his setup is great his slam and his ult are really fun ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it nothing on your side nothing you can fix lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that totally the problem lol i would just love the old sprint 3 back but only on melee ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,the fact that my ult just makes people run and i cant catch up because sprint 3 nerf d my poor vamana,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,chronos is fine where he is he does not need a buff ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,well that what you get with low mobility gods lol gotta work on positioning and awareness even if they have blink you could predict when they are going to blink or at least when they have the chance to blink ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,is there not a mute function at all ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would be fine with putting sprint 3 back to how it was but only for melee character another thing that hurts him a lot is the abundance of weakening curse not sure if anything could change about that ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,all you had to do was leave the lobby ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,not every god in the game needs a cc immune ultimate ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,no problem he so fun tho d was way better when sprint 3 was good tho ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you do not really need jotunns on him your build looked fine besides that you could have gotten witchblade or frostbound hammer to replace jotunns those items are both very good against hunters your 3 is safe lane clear and a ton of damage but your 2 is way easier to hit you can also clear the wave easily from the side while poking the enemy at the same time you can combo all of your moves to do insane damage knock them up with your 1 and then cancel it hit the 3 to slow them and then hit them with the 2 you could pop them with quite a few basic attacks as they are slowed vamana is my favorite god p good luck with him ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you remember the female warriors we have had ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ok i know ymir sounds a little slow but not that slow damn ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,stacks are halved when you die with heartseeker or doom orb noone really buys those items anyways p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,stacking items require you to kill a minion or kill a god to get a stack each stack adds some type of stat depending on the item each item says in the description what the max amount of stacks for that item is ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you should watch some videos by drybeargamers on youtube he has a ton of videos with great commentary ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,this is an accurate representation of the level 30 players in my casual games ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i like my vel macro it even better when you find an enemy with them and you just have a constant rivalry with them d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i used to hate him tho p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i saw a post one time where this guy thought anhur was a melee character he said he accidentally clicked one day and saw the spear go flying lol,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,as a person that has mastered him 6 times i disagree lol i always have fun playing vamana ,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i play solo i know what the problem was i was bakasura and my whole entire side of the map was abandoned by my team the only rotation was from our support and he got xp from my blue buff and then fed bellona a kill ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i usually watch drybear videos ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,bellona she always dominates lane my support walks over once and feeds her and i never see anyone else but her and the enemy jungler again ,7,Smite
ThatGuySlay,well i like the vamana buff ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,thanks d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,bellona sticks to people anyways lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,but blink op d it allows them to initiate and still have an escape ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,maybe people do not wanna be reminded d ,-1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,maybe people do not wanna be reminded d ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,vamana you can see everything i am looking at you aphro ,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,he a ranked player that plays mid mainly usually kukulkan sometimes janus he does not join curse and i do not believe he speaks in chat either he makes some crazy plays and sometimes buys teleport to gods lol,6,Smite
ThatGuySlay,barra would be too busy laughing at stuff wolfy says to hit autos lol and the comms listen ins lol,8,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i was flying around as apollo the enemy ao kuang had like 1 health but had khepri ult on him i waited and he went behind a rock i ulted down and he still had khepri ult he got revived and the team swarmed me lol ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,backdoor potential lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,invades what can a scylla do at level 1 ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,what do you clear with i have always used belch and done pretty well ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,vamana is my favorite slowing people bopping them knocking the entire team up stomping around too bad i feel like a snail in my ult lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea ik i feel like fatalis on hunters is worse than sprint instead of a few seconds of gas pedal they can now have it for most of the time lol oh and i made a post about sprint 3 on melee gods and got downvoted xd made it before this post,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,if kali gets sprint she cannot get blink like everyone has been buying have you seen blink kali the quins build usually includes fatalis anyways ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,considering that a ton of people are picking up blink now do you think they would switch back to sprint on those characters ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,as a legendary vamana this is totally balanced lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,but then hunters have an attack speed of about 2 5 so does that little damage sacrifice mean anything in the end to them ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,lol yea but that not the best pickup on her considering what her web does ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think that would be awesome ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i honestly find fatalis to be more annoying than sprint 3 was ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,this melee characters should get old sprint 3 it was not really overpowered on them ,15,Smite
ThatGuySlay,my poor vamana do you think the sprint 3 nerf should have been for ranged gods only ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,do you think they should have just nerfed sprint 3 for ranged gods ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,would they have to take away his current passive or just add that to it ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea but with the heartseeker buff patch they buffed her spirit arrow ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think this keep me logged in button on the launcher is a lie too ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,her spirit arrow still hits like a truck ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,so that proves that they did not fix cripple from stopping jumps from applying lol,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,a lot of people play casuals because they do not have the pressure that leagues do i do not really think leagues are much better than casuals you still get teammates that have no clue what theyre doing i would rather just play casuals ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,and in learning all the gods their abilities and passives you will probably play against them more easily you will be able to predict their attacks and whatnot ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that sounds terrible to me since i usually get teammates that do not know how to play or how to build at level 30 sometimes i just get trolls who refuse to surrender and they just feed ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it not just apollo mez alot of characters can take people out of jumps tyr can fearless fenrir jump before he lands and it takes away the damage of the jump ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,lol this guy,-1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,release bellona was a mess her heal was crazy her ult gave so much her passive was really good just so annoying ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,vamana he just so fun,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,id love to watch and chat but thanks to smitegame mods ill be missing out on the chatting part ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,sad that the hun batz clip where he yells get shit on isnt there haha,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,oh well derp ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that not even with full heartseeker stacks ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i want this since the sprint nerf it kinda tough to keep up with people in his ult some people are even saying he one of the worst gods right now lol,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,the movement speed is only for 1 second lol ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,bich plz ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i usually go runeforged boots i like attack speed physical defense exe frostbound rage you will still lack magical defense though so you could switch the physical defense item for hide of the urchin ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,haha challenge accepted ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that not even with the movement speed from the ult lol,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,does not vamana have one of the slowest attack speeds for a warrior too ,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that laugh at the end omg xd,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,where my team,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,he just that fast ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,oh i never knew if that would work or not ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,raptr has the regular screen capture too press a button to start recording and then press that button again to stop not sure if that what you meant p,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,there alot of abilities like that usually the circle on the ground abilities have a larger area than shown some of these include scylla crush anubis grasping hands chaac thunder axe ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,his ult is weird at times ,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,do you have a dedicated graphics card if so there are 2 great programs that you can use and they barely impact your fps for nvidia cards you could use shadowplay for amd cards you could use the amd raptr i have been using raptr for a while now and i love it p there a replay function where you hit a button and it saves the last few minutes of your gameplay it allows you to change the number of minutes too p,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i totally agree with what you said about vamana i just want big baby back d ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i just wanna run at people as big baby pls ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i want it reverted for my vamana d ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,r9 390 8gb,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have even had the jungle buffs just circle around me when playing khepri ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,woah i want warrior tabi on zeus o,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that would make janus so overpowered imo ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it did not get buffed got reverted lol,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,yep it was thanks ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea i just noticed the post ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,hmm maybe that was the issue i did not check to see if i had his voice pack before i purchased the chest ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i rolled and got the loki voice pack which i already have lol like what i sent in a support ticket hopefully it gets fixed ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i am just pointing out how strong an early ichival can be on him i watch wolfy stream and he usually starts with starter item ichival boots qins ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,its actually 6 dashes p the dash will then be on cooldown ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,healing also charges the ult ability healing at least ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,lets not nerf hebo ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,imagine if the shield health took you out of execute range ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,and do not forget ichival passive if you build it works so well on osiris ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think she fine if other warriors were like they used to be she would not be that good lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,its an issue that comes and goes for me has not happened in a week or so its really hard to play with that ping i have even had several matches where the whole team was lagging ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,wolfy swears frostbound is the best on nem lol,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,exactly also hi fellow wolfy chat member ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,awilix can pull chaac when he teleports to his axe ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,this is where i would yell get me outttt ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,well the frostbound hammer adds health for the ult regen rage works well in his ult because you gain 100 power i found deathbringer to be too inconsistent for me ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you know that bluestone got nerfed right i usually start with 2nd tier runeforged my full build would look like runeforged boots exe midguaridan frostbound rage thanks for sharing your build though always looking to improve my vamana ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,lass was really eager to kiss him ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,christ oh jesus that part cracked me up xd,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,may i ask what your typical vamana build is o i have never built fatalis on him yet ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,true i was thinking before the combo breaker patch ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,having an advantage does not mean you will win more likely yes but no guarantee ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea but the problem is not entirely premades lol i see uneven teams all the time even in ranked it the matchmaking i have easily beat a 5 man premade several times as a duo queue p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,what would they play then arena or siege when they want to play conquest lol take premades as a chance to improve despite getting a bad team vs premades there always room for you to improve,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i feel like people who complain need to just play the god that they are complaining about understand how the god works and how your enemies avoid things learn the signs of initiation and whatnot ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think serqet is pretty bad against him despite her having 2 escapes she will most likely use those to deal damage or initiate if ah puch ults and uses the 1 that a dead serqet ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,this is so true i went against an ah puch in solo lane as osiris one of the least fun matches ever i could hide behind tower and still get blown up my jungle would try to gank and die from his ult and 1 ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i do not think his slow on his 1 is fine or the range or how fast it travels ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i downloaded those drivers the other day and still had the crash i may have to clean all the old drivers out ,1,alienisolation
ThatGuySlay,i am planning on getting the r9 380 p i have the money just hope my case is big enough,1,alienisolation
ThatGuySlay,my quality was always fine and hitting the record replay button does lag for a second but it usually does not impact my gameplay because i press it after a team fight ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i do not wanna see mages back in solo i just want my warriors but as someone said all you have to do is invade them which is much easier now that the camps take longer to kill you either kill them and put them behind or make them run out of mana and lose xp except aphro solo every aphro seems to never run out of mana or die lol hence why i hate mage solo ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,imagine if the shield was destroyed by cc ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,imagine if the shield was destroyed by cc ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,raptr is so good been using it for like 2 years ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you should try out the amd raptr i like it way better than dxtory d and you can press a button and save the last few minutes of gameplay no need to record all the time ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,why did not they just nerf it for ranged characters people mostly complained about it on hunters i thought ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,100 agree everyone just taunts while running away and i cry on the inside ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,oops reading after waking up is not always good ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,was playing osiris in solo and stayed for one more wave enemy arachne ganked me and fought on minions she died then swk came to lane and did the same lol here the vid https m youtube com watch v uh8hophupfc,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i am planning on getting a better one soon ,1,alienisolation
ThatGuySlay,if my friend says he found a new god that he loves he most likely gonna die a million times and blame me lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would rather have damage or protections ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would like to see the movement speed penalty for auto attacks removed while in his ult that all i ask lol or give back part of the passive where taking damage lowers the ult cooldown vamana is my favorite character to play but the sprint 3 nerf hurt a lot ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ao kuang 1 bastet cats ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,just tether as many people as you can with your 3 it reduces the damage they do ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i do not only like awilix for her voice pack ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,maybe you should ask his complete thoughts on it instead of calling him salty he was talking about it in wolfy stream last night and gave several alternatives but said that no one would listen to them ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,the wave emote is pretty awesome too ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would totally buy that skin lol gahdamn,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i always have the one teammate that ruins my a team they pick kukulkan or something ,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,its been back for a while ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,wow that very detailed ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ah puch ults and my jungler immediately says fuck that bye lol every time ,10,Smite
ThatGuySlay,what gets me is how far it goes and how fast if you are a melee character in solo against him you are not even safe in tower ,20,Smite
ThatGuySlay,need something to add stacks to stacking items and maybe something to activate an ability that gives stats just so you are able to test things ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,old vamana passive and old sprint 3 on vamana now everyone runs away ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i hate facing him in any mode his 1 goes so far and so fast it nearly impossible to dodge with the huge aoe i would not call it a skillshot at all ,28,Smite
ThatGuySlay,this is the internet things do not go your way all the time ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think its kinda funny reading people complain especially a while back when they changed kali ,9,Smite
ThatGuySlay,just float they will think youre dead ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you have to do what barraccuda does and go into each game saying to yourself that you are the best do not be overly confident and dive tier 2 tower at 2 minutes though ,9,Smite
ThatGuySlay,this happens to everyone xd,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would suggest appealing the ban to hirez everett i saw a post earlier and i think thats the person they mentioned ,6,Smite
ThatGuySlay,even late its not that good lol,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i do not wanna use fatalis really ill just stick with frostbound and hope thats enough ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,what would you build on vamana this patch i can never decide what to build not sure if qins would be better than exe or not could you give me a full build possibly against a 4 physical team thanks for answering all these questions btw ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i did not see it in patch notes either i looked at the abilities in game ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,righttttt lol,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,did you see that they changed his healing it does 20 5 of the damage at max rank i think ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have something that may fix it not entirely sure i did it and my lag stopped but it may be just a coincidence you need to know how to enter command prompts on your pc you will enter this ipconfig flushdns i was lagging alot yesterday and the lag seemed to stop after i did that may be worth a try ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i got it from a chest i would rather use the swc skin if i had it p but now i use the soldier one ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,wait you mean that you are glad they removed the removal of the attack penalty as a vamana player i hate that they removed the removal of the penalty i just want to stomp people and run fast ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,depends who what you are playing you could replace boots with fatalis as a hunter i suppose ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i never really liked the diamond sword skin lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,none of those sound good to me lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,buff my vamana plz give no auto attack penalty during his ult d,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,buff my vamana plz give no auto attack penalty during his ult d,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,itssl ay that wasnt that hard lol itsslay i couldnt shift tho xd too much work,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea i did not understand this either but i guess he was just in another chest so they wanted to put another skin in this chest and i doubt boycotting the chest will do anything lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i did not see anything there ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,hi rez even has a rapper now wow now i see where all the money goes ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,she does not need a buff qins price is going down and she is not going to need hog this will allow her to have actives such as sprint and beads she gonna be annoying ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,where would i find that setting ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,smite is definitely out of beta ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,more entertaining than smite with 600 ping ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ah i see ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,baked or not ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i just wave at them ,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,with vamana i usually build boots you could build attack speed boots if you want runeforged hammer works well with his passive and ult executioner maybe qins after the new patch physical defense such as mystical mail or midguardian mail frostbound hammer damage item you could build crit here possibly odysseus bow due to the 100 power from his ult there are so many ways you could build vamana and i can never decide what to build the build i stated works better against a team with more physical hope that helps be sure to get sprint on him for his ult you may have to pick up fatalis after this next patch due to the sprint 3 nerf ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have had all of the skins from it i just want the chest with derpules nuclear ymir ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i love hearing people complain about her really there are some pretty stupid posts on here lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,and do not fight in her ult ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think that people do not realize that bellona 2 is much easier to dodge than they think ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea like omg can we plz nerf bellona shes really really strong even after he several nerfs s,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,they didnt listen to the pleas to change the method for obtaining the new agni skin lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i once had an assault match where both teams had a jump party the entire game best game ever ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,just like sylvanus grover and the owl all wave d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,the 1 usually does more damage to me ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,they did not even need to back there is way too much xp in the jungle now ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,is not thanatos nox son eww ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would much rather have a cupid announcer pack ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,can medusa even have an ass ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i suggest checking out nshadow on twitch or youtube he a masters joust player and he could answer any questions you have ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you play carefully and make them waste that potion ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,seems like a huge step back for me ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,this has been done many times nothing has come from it the post wanting to change the requirements for the skin had a large number of upvotes too ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,but now the 900 health is not as predictable as the 25 ,9,Smite
ThatGuySlay,feelsbadman,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i play vamana i just dash through people and then smack them to death if i get hurt i press 4 and walk into their phoenix to finish them ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you are so right ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it in the christmas chest there was a video showing that they are bringing halloween and christmas chest back for the sale ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think the exclusives are the only difference not too sure though each chest usually has different contents ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,probably because they did not wanna put them on sale or maybe it was a mistake ,9,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i already have everything in those chest ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,the chest rolls are also 100 ,12,Smite
ThatGuySlay,solo would ,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,wow it crazy fast in game lol,18,Smite
ThatGuySlay,happening to alot of people ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you can use the invis to throw your enemies off or to distract while your teammates attack people get pretty scared when they hear that invis sound having the invis on instacast helps p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i say put a system like cs go they have a thing like leader teacher and friendly no rewards ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,same if i ult and they do not die i want that steroid ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,funny how that happens to so many people lol,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,is this an inside joke or something if not there no reason for discussion lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i really want to spam it to my enemy in solo lane please ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,kill me now d ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,or you are matched with 2 trolls who feed and do not surrender had a guy refuse to hog the speed buff and then he dive tower 1v2 you think people would learn some things by level 30,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have made a ton of friends in the lobby and had some great conversations no thank you ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i actually like the new passive some people like to activate the 2 for the extra crit chance before they sash but i usually do not do that it leaves the 2 open for me to get that extra health 1 4 of your max hp is pretty helpful ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,some people would do it for free i am sure wolfy has said that he would help most streamers do have 17 minutes and 30 seconds between queues to talk about this stuff say with someone like a community manager or some other employee ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,low health janus portaled through a wall into the enemy tower and died lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,can you really get the skin from co op ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,nice those monitors look a little too close though o like too close to your eyes when you sit down maybe ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,christianity does not interest me l do not know what abilities they would give to those deitities ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yes and it very worth it ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,she cajun lol nothing racist about the way she talking ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,what if you are flying with apollo in his ult and ares ults you as youre taking off ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i recommend watching drybeargamers on youtube ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it pretty funny watching him run in the jungle and just die instantly by 3 people though lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,she is meant to counter hunters her 3 is a disarm not a silence also do not fight in her ult ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,remember that you have to play with them in your party and you may be put in a match with higher level players those matches may be difficult for low level new players ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think this is one thing that a majority of the community agrees on ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,my friends made me download it all i did in the beginning was herc and thor support but one of the most hype videos for me is mlc multiple person root at swc d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,are you sure about that lol ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,right why cannot they just release everything at one time ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,he not really a good pick there are many other junglers that have much more setup or damage ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,the whirlpool slows and pulls towards the center you do not need gem to slow with it and medusa passive with fatalis could explain why it did not seem to slow you and you also have the movement speed from boots and heartseeker ,-1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it fun sometimes we end up laughing for like 30 minutes over stuff ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,he rages even more if i take his kills lol and then i rage back,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,the kid is like 13 lol i try my best to be nice to him it really tough sometimes because his decisions are terrible and he likes to blame people for everything ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay, jungle ward my mid lane omfg a quote from a friend,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,okay thanks i have looked but did not see anything i live in texas and lately i have had at least 90 ping with spikes up to 300 and 800 ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,how can you tell which servers you are on ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,mine has gone even higher than that up to 800 ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that moment when you are from texas and you end up with someone from california in your match ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i still do not know why i was banned lol smitegame please ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yep had a whole lobby that was lagging 200 ping ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,nothing is balanced around arena just saying ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,she mayan you would think she was used to all the critters ,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,when you find a funny friendly person from the community d,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,dm when allied got his penta d,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ruthless ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ah puch 1 goes way to far and way too fast for that damn slow i hate it so much ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i agree if i build full tank i should not die so damn fast especially when an adc doesnt have crit online ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that an ability though feel free to school me if i am wrong ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,watch drybeargamers on youtube he a designer for the game and has a ton of gameplay for each character i also suggest watching some pros livestream i am sure the helpful redditor lionkun will give you a huge guide with links to several youtube channels and streams ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,do not forget to tell adcs to follow their own calls if we have a chance of getting an easy kill by tower diving and i am told to attack ill go in if i turn around to see the adc at the tower line i doubt you will see me in your lane again ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,but then you could sit in base and just place wards lol there would have to be a cooldown or restriction ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i thought the same thing 0,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,no bm here d just showing how the matchmaking is ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,wow logic used on reddit i wish i had an award for you ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,their early auto damage is pretty crazy apollo has 68 damage per auto attack with dt and morningstar ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,tfw cupid dashes into the tower misses his ult and dies to xbal ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i know there is not a perfect build i am just looking to see what other combinations of items other people use ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i understand what you mean i am one of those that played casuals and watched streams to learn before i jumped into ranked the guys in this match did not look like that type of players though poor decision making poor teamwork ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea it wolfy thebest was duo queueing with someone else from masters at the same time wolfy was queuing ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,qualifying process op p,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,wolfy said he would sit in hour long queues as long as he got a balanced match instead of waiting in 17 30 queues for silvers in his team vs masters players ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,average elo should not be the basis of good matchmaking a person with 2800 elo should not be on a team with someone who has 1300 elo it would be great to have more people play ranked but people play and find out that the matchmaking is like this that causes them to not want to play ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think it was 9 minutes there were several masters players queuing at the same time ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i was not in the game lol i was just watching the stream,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,so you do not include reformed hammer in your build and also why stone of gaia over bulwark of hope i prefer the health and passive ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,exactly they attempted to increase the population with the amc skin and it worked for a bit ,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you are right myth ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i know the feeling i am over here in solo 7 1 while my duo lane has fed xbalanque 17 1 it game over by that time ,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you cannot really carry those players they kept making bad decisions and went into bad fights the teamwork was non existent edit i should read better yea this is why i only played ranked for the amc skin and then quit ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think nemean and midgardian have around the same stats right i usually end up against a comp with aa based gods the build gives around 300 400 damage at level 20 for your auto attack before mitigations the crits get up to around 800 1000 you also get extra power and protections which turns into more power from your ult the ult crits are insane ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,my current build is boots runeforged nemean exe deathbringer and malice d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that item gives protections and attack speed pleaseeeee my vamana build would be complete ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would love gauntlet of thebes for my warriors and guardians ,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,lol kumbha is op ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,agni ult it like zero mana but realy loki vanish his 1 is the cheapest move gives stealth damage reduction movement speed and a nice dot that does more damage than the 3 op i love his 1 tho d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,being ugly is not always bad people usually run from vamana d and they dont hit you ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,sprint and frostbound together i have been trying that and it is pretty good ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i know i would just like to find a core build of like 3 4 items d,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,what about his vew xd clank ohh yeaa ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,she could lifesteal but at 33 due to the cleave not sure its changed ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have tried that and i really like it especially with all the hunters these days i often buy bulwark of hope instead of heartward for the health and the shield at low health i am thinking of getting power boots and replacing executioner with o bow for teamfights ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,runeforged hammer ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,please just dont ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,playing him in solo you just wanna bully your opponent the whole time if you can bully them without taking alot of damage and you find that the enemy jungler isnt ganking you often you could build boots into jotunns if they hurt and youre getting camped build huge defense first early on you can try to pull the enemy into your tower the rest of the time you just harass them and press 3 ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,what gamemode are you playing him in ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,if you think smite gods are expensive you should see other mobas like heroes of the storm and league of legends ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i usually get warrior boots runeforged mystical mail hide of the nemean lion bulwark that leaves room for another item of your choice maybe jotunns if you have the money p you could buy jotunns earlier if you feel safe enough in lane ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,gotcha p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,did you just say late early game how does that work p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,check out drybeargamers on youtube he a game designer for smite and he has a ton of content,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,well they would leave xbal alone because its bad enough as is same with artemis ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you too i wanted to include that in my first post but i thought it was too personal thought a solution may be in the instructions ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i liked her kit in season 1 before they put the delay on her ult it was easy to destroy everyone ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i just checked and the process was still going lol,-1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,concquest failfish,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea i do not think anyone actually asked for this buff she was always an ability based hunter she actually needed autos to kill before but now she can kill with a few abilities ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i am just tired of neith and her 1 it does 2 3million damage and roots me as if the damage was not enough ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yes its okay we all derp sometimes ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,its a movement speed slow and a self heal i am talking about an attack speed debuff similar to witchblade p,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,lets give it a disarm and make the silence keep you from using beads lol if anything is needed its his attack speed debuff on his 3 ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i placed a ward in my lane further instructions needed because i keep dying i do not think the ward is working correctly ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,eloheart d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,could that issue be the cause of the ping spikes i have had in game ,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,looks like everyone gonna be smurfing more now ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,and amc has no real escape so he has to use his beads to escape your ultimate you can also build tanky and still do a ton of damage shield of the underworld works wonders as well ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you planned on letting your main and smurf accounts autowalk in 1v1 were not you lol that was my plan,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i like hades vs amc ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,does coop count because ill put 1v1 vs my smurf and turn on autowalk lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,why not use that bm as a motivation to get better i always just try to laugh at the bm ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i need it too d also hi ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,the macro laughs are so satisfying and creepy xd i love them,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ah nice d,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,get outta here p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would have rather watched that still lol ,-4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i would have loved to see how this game went without 2 hunters on each team ,-4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ok d best of luck ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,http www twitch tv competitive online v 5259489 the hel gameplay starts at about 6 42 00 it not a full game but i hope it helps you if you need another i am sure i could search for more ,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,fenrir how am i supposed to fill my passive if everyone kills the wave i cannot brutalize because everyone beats my like i just peed on their carpet ,2,Smite

ThatGuySlay,have you tried not leveling her ult at level 5 this allows you to level your 1 and 3 so that they hit like a truck you can play her in mid if you are careful i start vampires shroud tier 1 boots and a lot of options then i usually build doom orb this is how wolfy plays her and he a pretty great hel ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,its the little blue lines surrounding the ultimate diamond indicator near peoples playercards ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,nah i looked at a vid from season 1 and it was there lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,haha i used to be so scared of those hearts xd i really hated cupid when i was new ,2,Smite

ThatGuySlay,lmao i see a correlation ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yea autocorrect i changed it lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i am not the best at explaining things but i am sure there are guides i would recommend checking out drybeargamers on youtube he a developer for the game and his commentary may help quite a bit i also recommend checking out some streams one stream i always watch is wolfy his twitch name is competitive online he plays solo and jungle quite often he will probably be streaming all night if you wanna drop in ill be there p tell them i sent you if you decide to check it out ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,its great against fast characters such as posiedon ,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,ikr ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i know just get to watch the spam lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,wish i could have been part of that but i am banned from smitegame chat for some reason xd was really funny tho,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i think knowing your opponent is actually one of the biggest parts of solo lane know what they can do know how they can do it and when anyone could be viable as long as you know how to play and how the enemy can play ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i suggest you check out incons guide its from season 1 but should still be viable,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,great ult i am disappointed in that chaac though why not spam mayarific ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i like the item on chaac just chase people with your slow for days ,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,he started calling gold fury while the support and adc were in lane with him and he just kept on lol ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,sorry if someone has mentioned this already but be sure to check out wolfy on twitch he streams pretty much every day and he plays tyr alot his twitch name is competitive online hope that helps d,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,by being under tower they would still get xp but not gold unless they killed the minion so they would be ahead in levels which can be huge ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,its kaostic now ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,yes and i am pretty sure a lot of people do this ,5,Smite
ThatGuySlay,no you did not just lol,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,hey i was eating cereal ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,max your ult last the passive power on the 3 is usually better than the ult slow i pretty much use that same build but i use asi my last game as solo baka i went 39 8 d,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,the enemy solo laner would get ahead of the 2 solo laners would not he ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,me too i guess you would have also been mad at the support for making all the bad calls i got mad and told the guy that id call the shots 3,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it was such a stupid match i wad solo against neith but i think artemis thought it was duo lane because she was always there and when i tp would in i was surprised to see it that low ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,haha throw in the gender confused assassin in there ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,especially the supports who make terrible calls we are not going to attack the fire giant while they have 3 people on this side of the map ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that constructive criticism not they type of bm i am talking about p criticism actually helps them as long as they listen ,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,not if you have sprint 3 and they cannot hit you d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,d that means no rage lol i am too greedy,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that would work too extra health and antiheal is great i just like the gaia passive and stats ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ah true i usually get stone of gaia straight into runeforged against magical you do not really need that early movement speed ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,not if you have runeforged and witchblade ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,well you cannot do much against hades until you have crit the goal is to just poke people out of lane let them know that they do no damage to you and you do a ton there so many combos with him knockup 2 3 ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,sometimes it is if its my 5th time telling them and the whole team is raging s,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,i had a match earlier where my adc got hog and my support got cooldown boots first oh and the adc had no lifesteal pretty sure we would have lost if the enemy jungle hadnt disconnected ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,would you rather be in a game with complete noobs or people of your skill level ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,her ult is still crazy strong the 2 is also insane ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,golden bow o bow attack speed boots crit crit exe teamfights are so easy this is my build for adc in assault p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have learned to peek corners if a person is trying to gank by hiding right next to a wall i usually see them and start using autos in their direction and taunting d i seeee youuuu,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i see it the same way,-3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i had a match where my jungle did not connect till around 1 30 that mana buff hurts guys ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i used to be so bad with vamana got him in assault one day built crit and sprint 3 finally figured out how to play him d ,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,my games consist of me going 6 0 in solo while my teammates feed everyone then i die from the whole team gank maybe my games would be better if i actually supported instead of these idiots ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,and that nurse skin hey i am pretty good right ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,vamana your attempt at a gank was cute ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,oh now vamana has deathbringer rage and sprint 3 instant trip back to base awesome ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,why cant i play a mage in solo without getting invaded you have your own buffs and i have mine theyre in my jungle mind your own business my buff is in my jungle for a reason ,2,Smite

ThatGuySlay,mine does it alot especially when i alt tab ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,he pretty strong in assault because his tornadoes cover a nice portion of the lane and there easy setup for his ultimate his tornadoes are really powerful with penetration he was also way stronger at one time ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay, you will likely lose this match as we have matched you against better players good luck that would motivate the hell out of some people im not gonna lose ,3,Smite
ThatGuySlay,best skin from the chest lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it especially good on vamana with his passive ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,technically true but that team was in no way balanced p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ive heard people use it on herc ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,and you can walk right over it and it does nothing ,12,Smite
ThatGuySlay,since when has logic applied to smite i just had an assault team with assassins and guardians while the enemy team had 4 ranged characters no logic there ,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,there was a post earlier saying that the passive movespeed still goes towards your passive ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i just ult minions and throw them at the enemies under tower ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that moment when you get to lane a realize you do not have a buff even though you walked over it ,141,Smite

ThatGuySlay,if you want sure ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i usually build runeforged hammer boots attack speed or the power i like speed more witchblade executioner rage deathbringer with that i do really well against a physical opponent just try to bully them out of lane as much as you can make sure to get sprint 3 for when you use your ultimate if they have an escape try to bait it out ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay, this ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,glad i wasnt the only one that noticed that ,2,Smite

ThatGuySlay,bignipligger yea reported lol,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,it spreads the poison to all enemies around just like killing a god does its op lol,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,if my team is full of idiots and they make dumb decisions like stopping for mid camps on the way to defend fire giant or like yesterday when i told my team to attack the right phoenix because the enemy team was left my stupid teammates walk half way down the lane to kill the minions when they had he support to tank it i have never been so pissed especially considering that i was carrying 39 5 ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,idiots attack the right phoenix and they walk halfway down the damn lane to attack minions you have got the support to tank that shit those idiots are my friends sadly lol another is when the support waits 10 seconds to tank a tower or phoenix while you are spamming attack ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,killing that minion spreads the poison,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,kill that minio to spread the poison,0,Smite
ThatGuySlay,killing that minions spreads the poison though,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,with that kukulkan ult xd ,7,Smite
ThatGuySlay,only bad thing about my build is no magic defense i put stone of gaia if its a magic heavy team but having sprint 3 allows for more damage or defense my second active is usually teleport ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,afk all the way too bad its on easter and i wo not get to watch ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have a ton of damage on him runeforged boots witchblade executioner rage deathbringer ,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,my thoughts exactly lol jk but he not really and irl friend ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have done this start before with anhur and his pillar its okay but solo and jungle get a late start,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,at least you did not have a scylla that aggressively uses their sentinel at low health,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,you think there a skin i do not have ha ,0,Smite

ThatGuySlay,is there one for afk d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,considering that taunt was only a small portion its as if he did not watch but oh well i liked the video s,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,true but some people do not even bother to watch someone commented on the post of my steal video i did not have to watch the video to know the steal was subpar ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,that why i said they are more likely to get downvoted its not guaranteed ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,got it in the chest for 400 gems well played hi rez well played ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i am not talking to a friend right now because i got tired of his shit he starts yelling at me because he 0 7 as support and cannot do anything yet he keeps rushing towards enemies my other friend always gets behind when he plays jungle he talks about how he the best at jungle though and it annoys me lol ,10,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i am just saying that if people do not know who a person is they are more likely to downvote them and leave negative comments not saying its incons fault lol and i posted my video because i thought it was neat not because he had posted one ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,vvvj vsaf ,2,Smite
ThatGuySlay,fire giant steal ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,exactly p its just a casual downvote him ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,haha that may have been me and my friends xd,1,Smite

ThatGuySlay,a pretty famous person such a incon can post a video and get over 200 upvotes i post a video of something very similar and get downvoted to hell people just want to expect more i guess ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,there a lack of support to new ones if you post a video on here most of the time its just going to get downvoted ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,wrong lol every other role can do damage which is their role support is meant to be a frontline you expect me to be a frontline with vanguard and boots against the person wildly shooting at me d and about waiting on gold i would hate to have to hear that it was my fault that my adc died because i was waiting for 5 seconds xd its always the supports fault ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,your english is fine d,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i know it not much but sometimes i leave base with no money after just buying hog 3 i am just trying to say that everyone can afford wards and the supports are the ones that need to most money to do their part p,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,totally agree on the part about taking 300 damage from each auto as a tank,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,50 gold that the rich mid laner could also buy in some cases the support is the only one warding ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,ill take option two lol i have heard people say its a dash and leap i have heard people say he can be pulled out by awilix and some say he cannot ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,oh i see ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,its because its a dash,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,greatest chang e he gotten ,4,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i do this a lot in assault lol joking around with teammates is so funny ,12,Smite
ThatGuySlay,how much laughing happens during the spl games i feel like you and allied would be laughing constantly ,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i like him because you can poke out the enemy and set up easy kills do not know why more people do not like him,1,Smite
ThatGuySlay,i have seen a lot of people max abilities over ultimate on gods like athena ymir and kumbha ,1,Smite
