fortysevenhats,you can often return stuff at the grocery store yes even if only because you did not like it it okay but check the store policy most supermarkets i have tried this it been fine i do not do it often but if you buy something that gone bad accidentally or something you really just cannot stand give it a go because asking is for free most food stores here have policies where they take things back for any reason if not it happens we all buy stuff we regret whether it was planned or impulsive ,2,Frugal
fortysevenhats,no way using a store return policy does not make you cheap if it going to rot in your fridge or go in the trash why not just ask asking is for free and most stores do have some guarantee of their products and will take stuff back even if the only reason is that you did not like it i think you would be stupid not to take advantage of such policies if they are available to you obviously not every shopping trip but definitely on riskier purchases or something you are not sure you will enjoy ,-3,Frugal

fortysevenhats,some rude comments in here i also tend to spend more than i should on groceries a month sometimes we can live on 40 wk other times it close to 100 wk i find always buying stuff on sale you can look up the flyers before you go or if you are me you wander around the supermarket on your phone googling recipes and sticking to a recipe preferably one that has ingredients you already have at home or only one or 2 extra ones helps me buy stuff you will actually eat not just because it on sale or cheap we have definitely bought things that were on sale or managers special just because it was cheap then let it go to waste because we did not have a plan keep a pantry of spices and sides and extras so you can buy meat but you know you have a thing of instant mashed potatoes and some frozen veggies always on sale at home already spices for adding flavor obviously i am not the best at grocery shopping and we eat out a lot too just takes some effort for sticking to your plan and trying to save when you can buy a different laundry detergent if it on sale unless you or the kiddo have sensitive skin or try new brands than you are used to ,1,Frugal

fortysevenhats,right i am on the young side but between my full time gig and trying to stay up all night just to work more and then work again the next morning is hard even though the club is my fun job it still difficult i go out for fun and often it just a promo mission and an excuse to drink somewhere else for a few hours only a few times a year myself i cannot for the life of me figure out how i used to survive drinking 5 nights a week and still somehow getting to work and being mostly functional now i wont even drink more than one if i know i am working the next day haha i think stuff is shifting but trying to find a way to appeal to the young crowds and the ol regulars is hard i think the whole synthwave movement is pretty close to joining the sides though at least that the direction we are going ,2,AskReddit
fortysevenhats,i think also people are less inclined to go out when they have access to so much to do at home so going out to a club is not necessarily as popular as it used to be because it so much easier to stay in and listen to a spotify playlist it tough we have great nights but it a tough business especially for the under 25 crowd they are very hard to please or just different than we are used to ,1,AskReddit
fortysevenhats,i think part of the problem is that crowds come out to hear what they wanna hear expect they bitch it not new music but you play anything new and unfamiliar even if it great and the dance floor clears at least in the goth industrial scene it hard not to pander to your crowd when they are the ones supporting you thick and thin ,2,AskReddit

fortysevenhats,my favorite easy meal is this 1 chicken breast or more if you want leftovers for lunch or dinner the next day 1 packet taco seasoning half a yellow onion one whole bell pepper color up to you i like red or yellow or orange 1 large tomato or 2 or 3 small ones use veg or canola oil pour a bit into a bowl with your taco seasoning and put your chopped up raw chicken breast in there and make sure each piece gets coated i eyeball the amount of oil throw in pan and cook until chicken is cooked 165 is safe for chicken i find it easier to cook the small pieces the oil and seasoning and hot pan creates a nice crispy on the outside of some of the pieces i cook in a cast iron pan take chicken out of pan throw in all chopped veg and let those cook down to preferred texture my boyfriend likes the veg a little crunchier but you can cook til soft too add to bowl with chopped chicken and mix you can either put this on a tortilla shell and eat like tacos or just out of the bowl i did this last night with cheese and sour cream mixed in yum also remember to wash any surfaces and utensils that touched raw chicken and your hands no cross contamination i cut my veg first on my one cutting board and then switch to the raw chicken so it stays uncontaminated ,1,EatCheapAndHealthy
