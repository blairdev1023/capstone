rainzer, well just a quick chime in here you are calling someone out for being misleading but then you say that you only see armor on some of these heroes 0 000001 of the time but the lowest example you actually gave was ragnaros at 6 25 of games and if he taking that talent it probably against a stun heavy composition which likely means you get a lot of value out of cassie talent against it nope that where understanding the talent comes in block gives you 2 charges of armor and then has a cooldown even if you took it that does not suddenly give you armor 100 of the time you took it so in the example of ragnaros he does not have armor 6 of the time he would only have armor a fraction of the time in those 6 of the games he not stunned 100 of the time in the games he takes the armor talent so you are not attacking ragnaros only when he stunned therefore just because people take the talent 6 of the time it does not mean he has armor 6 of the time he has armor less than 6 of time it only when he stunned which would be a very small percentage of the time in the games he even took the talent same with gazlowe robo ult which is what gives him armor if someone was running around with the robo ult active 100 of the time i would not be saying gazlowe has armor i would be sending an email to hacks blizzard also the number is 15 but it still applies ,1,heroesofthestorm
rainzer,wrong again the guy said specifically that few heroes have physical armor your rebuttal is that heroes can talent into physical armor and that is misleading given the talents themselves the frequency of their usage and the tiers that these talents are located in the only one cherrypicking anything here is you you went through a list of talents searched for armor and declared these heroes have armor lol no they do not in the context of their usage those heroes might have armor 0 000001 of the time you see them ,3,heroesofthestorm
rainzer, that not the talent i am talking about that one only gives spell armor no it does not the spell armor one is the most commonly taken 2 3 of the time mirage mirror images grant spell armor samuro has either armor while stealthed or armor granted by advancing strikes the combined usage of which is 2700 games out of the over 8200 he was played in it pretty apparent that all you did was look through hero talent lists and search for armor without understanding the hero or talent ,2,heroesofthestorm
rainzer,yea except some of them rarely if ever take these armor talents and to include them is intentionally misleading to try and make it look like doing it would be some massive buff to cassia like samuro armor talent is gaining armor while stealthed and is taken like 500 times out of 8000 games or like ragnaros has a talent that only gives him an armor boost while stunned so it was only taken 1700 times in over 11000 games and lol to mention gazlowe when his only applies during his ult if he takes robo or hammer armor only if stunned rooted while sieged that was taken only 400 times in 3700 games and adding any hero with block talent as a character that has armor is also intentionally misleading none of these are really significant armored kits cmon now ,16,heroesofthestorm

rainzer, several of the greats in dota are pro level at multiple characters roles because of the versatility it can offer in their drafts which is a far cry from every role if i play characters in two roles which was what most of the dota greats you wanted to reference that is still not the requirement set out by the op or your statement of playing every role therefore still a bullshit argument what is even more hilarious is you do not understand why it was a threat when the dota pros could hover champions in other roles pro tip it because they can swap them with their teammates to make the drafting a meaningful strategy and the other team had to guess whether it was a bluff swap or a pick,-1,heroesofthestorm

rainzer, beyond conflating solo queue with professional play you said it yourself several of faker deaths came while grouped not all in lane the first 3 deaths came in lane there even a video of the game lol you argue they should not be trying to keep laning in a losing match up faker 3rd death was a solo kill by leblanc that had 3 kills and 1 assist and 3 completed items with rng up 9 1 but it okay he faker so you would not try to give faker laning advice ,1,leagueoflegends
rainzer, i reckon faker would have been the first to admit that he and his team made numerous mistakes that goes without argument it faker worst career game and he has not had one close since but it important to note that we have the context and the video of the game to know and make these conclusions further we also give him the benefit of the doubt because he faker and yet dude had none of these things for the other guy and gave him no benefit and just assumed automatic trash and did everything wrong which is why i said it bullshit it possible the 0 12 guy is the worst player ever to play the game but it also possible he did everything he could short of plug pulling so that his dude would just sit in the fountain and even then it would not guarantee he would not get dove to another death ,10,leagueoflegends
rainzer, what you are saying is we did not really care about the 2nd amendment until the government started trying to restrict our rights because of the extremists of the civil rights movement which would be false if we go back and review the historical supreme court rulings on the 2nd amendment which people use these days to argue about it the 1968 act was the first control law but it was not the first law targeted towards guns we had the nfa in 1934 which gave us taxation towards manufacturers and transporters and also gave us the miller case with the militia argument and interpretation barrel length common military equipment use in defense etc the nfa came as a result of the saint valentines massacre what is interesting then is that despite the nfa and the miller case it did not change public politics or discourse nor did it rally the nra so if what really mattered was the constitutional right to bear arms and that was the argument you would think that we would have started down that road 40 years earlier in 1934 and not in the 70s and our first protection target would have been the mafia immigrant italians and not blacks but that not the case you were sold that story when the nra rebranded itself in the 70s and imagine the arguments if that actually happened rather than people crying over the definition of what an assault weapon or assault rifle was we would be arguing whether machine gun was defined ,1,videos

rainzer,for all we know it is entirely possible that the people complaining about getting screwed are correct because the us does not actually have any laws in place to force a video game company to demonstrate percent values for their gacha slot machine mechanisms japan has laws for this which is why japanese mobile games show you percentages in their gacha games i think china only recently started forcing game companies to demonstrate the percent values to actually be what they claim but while this applies to traditional games read standard gambling like slots and claw machines this has not fully translated to video gaming until either the law changes or someone tries arguing some technicality under gambling law ,3,leagueoflegends

rainzer, video games being dominated by males as an excuse for poor writing the excuse for poor writing has nothing to do with who is working in the industry it more likely due to the genres that make up the marketshare consider the following genres shooters fighters action sports racing and strategy these genres do not require strong characters in fact you could have a completely faceless protagonist with no backstory and still achieve success in any of these genres and that hugely important because if you combined the sales of these genres they make up over 75 of video game sales even just shooters action and sports alone would make up over 60 of the market and in these genres you do not need meaningful exposition for whoever is holding the gun or doing the punching or running the ball you could put it in the manual but all industry metrics indicate that even in roleplaying games less than 15 of people read all of the dialogue so imagine how many people would read the background story of a faceless protagonist in a shooter you could call your faceless shooter private john or private jane in call of duty on the brief loading screen and it would not make a bit of difference except maybe make some trolls angry or happy for no reason the only genres that offer the opportunity to give you time to explore characters in depth are role playing and adventure and the problem is that adventure games as a whole have largely died as a standalone genre gone are the days of games like kings quest or grim fandango or beyond good and evil because the people who say they wanted strong characters did not buy them when female games said they wanted a strong female protagonist and got beyond good and evil and praised the game on feminist blogs they still did not buy the game and at the time ubisoft creative director stated he regretted making the game because of it poor sales so you are left with roleplaying games which make up 10 of the market you can call it poor writing in video gaming if you want but it not poor writing it that you say you want good writing but then you did not buy the games in the genres that would give the game developers a means to offer you good writing and even in the genre that does exist for it the industry metrics show that you do not care about the writing because the numbers tell them you skip their writing ,6,OutOfTheLoop

rainzer, but i did not find the animations that impressive what we are going on here is comparison between their contemporaries if we went back to previous mass effects and examined them now absolutely they would not be considered stellar animation work there is rigidity there is awkwardness there are things that stick out there are bugs what was the comparison though for me2 the other stand out rpg for the year was fallout nv which directly received criticism for it facial animations as well as it various graphical bugs like random floating npcs as with me a so when we consider the previous mass effects we have to consider them in their respective periods if you went bug hunting as some people have done to try and defend me a it been proven you could cherrypick specific scenarios where previous mes looked bad but the problem is we are trying to pick on 5 7 year old games and comparing them to what should be the franchise current flagship title they should look bad in comparison there should be advancement ,6,videos

rainzer, animations should not make or break if a games good or not suspension of disbelief immersion is one of the core intangibles that determines whether a game is good or not bethesda games for example will often get criticism for the repetitive npc background dialogue or horses that climb vertical cliffs the reason most people do not consider these issues something that breaks these games is that background npc chatter and climbing a mountain with your horse is not a core gameplay mechanic in the games they are distracting and an objective reviewer would rightfully dock them points for it but it would not prevent them from considering them good games disclaimer i do not like bethesda games bring out your torches this does not fly when it comes to bioware games and facial animations interacting with your party and the npcs are sold as core to the gameplay and the storytelling if you have shitty animations then a major part of your storytelling mechanism sucks it would be like trying to have fran drescher the nanny as your audiobook narrator and trying to argue that the sound of the voice should not break a great audiobook technically the story is the same but your enjoyment of it is ruined ,23,videos

ama https www reddit com r beer comments 1fql1b the short time i spent working for rogue ales in in r beer that had the text removed from someone saying he worked at rogue but deleted it for fear of legal repercussions i will copy the text below as someone saved it this link to an article about their labor practices also seemed to be frequently posted http www nwlaborpress org 2011 0617 6 17 11ibt html full text of the ama post there been a lot of talk about rogue ales and its business practices over the past year or two i worked in their corporate office for a short time and so i would like to give a brief description of my experience there a little over two years ago i was laid off and in need of work my previous job was okay but i did not love it and wanted to do something that i would find personally fulfilling i have always loved beer and the idea of the craft brewing industry so i sent out a few e mails to local breweries to see if they could use someone like me about a week later i got a call at 9 30 pm from an old man named jack joyce he introduced himself as the founder and owner of rogue ales a brewery which at the time i naively loved and said he needed about 30 minutes to chat i was a little starstruck so of course i took his call i wo not go into every detail of the call but the gist of it was this we do not hire recent college graduates because they have not demonstrated any real work ethic yet he proceeded to tell me how lazy i am and how i would never make it at his company but that he would be willing to give me a shot he said that his employees get christmas and thanksgiving off work but that was it in his own words americans do not work hard enough anyway this was a little concerning but considering i was getting a call to work in an industry i really admired from something of an industry leader and the fact that i was broke i accepted his offer then and there i began working a few days later i walked into the office and expected to find jack as i would be working with him directly as an office ninja what they call new hires turns out he was in hawaii and i would be training with other people my mentor while jack was gone was someone jack referred to as an east coast jew basically i was given a stack of binders and told to read through them several times as this would be my training so i read them over and over again one entire binder was dedicated to the things that you should not say around jack words like new normal game changer paradigm etc if you did say them around him you would be punished seriously so after i had read all the training manuals about 4 times each my job was to use a clipping service to find any and all mentions of rogue in print or e media rogue does not have a dedicated pr department nor do they do any real marketing they allow the brand to speak for itself that sounds noble and all but the reality is they are more dedicated to selling their brand than they are making good beer when it comes right down to it john maier has full control over the brewing process but the joyce jack and his son brett not short for brettanomyces decide which beers will go to market in short they decide what is worth selling anyway my job focused on finding those mentions in the media and relaying that to others so they could leverage those mentions so what was so bad about rogue the way they treat their employees is absolute garbage i cannot remember all the i put up with that came directly from jack over the phone and through e mails mind you but it was awful i was commuting 45 miles to work and showed up 3 minutes late one day due to a wreck i was normally 15 20 minutes early rather than confront me personally brett joyce whose desk is set up in the middle of the office so he can personally oversee everyone sent an e mail to another employee stating insert her name can you ask mattsesar why he was late today this would have been embarrassing enough but he cc would the entire company everyone with a rogue e mail address so her e mail to me also cc would everyone i had to reply with my reason well turns out that for brett 3 minutes was just too much and my reason which he called an excuse warranted a public apology and an explanation of the steps i would take to prevent it from happening in the future so i had to apologize to the entire company for being 3 minutes late after that my incident was placed in one of the binders i had to read so that new hires from then through now and into the future would all read about how mattsesar was 3 minutes late to work one day that just one small example public humiliation was commonplace the less time you would spent there the more you were subjected to it hazing is one thing but this was outright harassment another example was when i took the company van to deliver mail to the downtown pub i was supposed to shadow one of the higher ups a woman who sorts jack e mails for him she been there for decades so she basically a queen i showed up started to take notes and she asked me why i did not have my clipboard with me i was confused told her i did not know anything about a clipboard she lost her and told me i was worthless that i would never survive there because i did not know about the clipboard i explained that i was never told about the clipboard and never saw anything about it in any of the 10 or so binders i had to read her response that the problem with you you just assumed you did not need to ask about it a few days later i had an emergency with a family member she had to be taken to the emergency room via ambulance and i was the closest one to her i got the phone call told someone that i had an emergency and had to leave and left at 2 00 pm i ended up getting there before the ambulance but that not important anyway the next day i got another e mail from brett joyce and a call from his father asking what the hell happened and demanded to know why i left work early i told them it was a medical emergency but that did not satisfy them i was told to write another letter of apology to the rest of the company at which point i said you to brett and walked out i called jack joyce and told him exactly what i thought of his operation that they make decent beer but as a business they are probably one of the worst i have ever seen they can make money and grow a business but they do not know how to operate a team i told him thanks for the opportunity but i was not willing to subject myself to daily harassment and abuse for a paycheck this was the only time that jack had anything remotely like respect for me i think he is not used to people standing up to him so when someone did it took him by surprise anyway i have not bought a single bottle of rogue since then there are plenty of other breweries to choose from that offer better beer for better prices i try to tell as many people as i can about rogue because i find them so distasteful if the joyce were to leave and john maier were to take over i think it would be a different story but as it stands now those two ruin the company for me ,23,OutOfTheLoop
rainzer, that they would exist at all would be huge and they cost money to make user metrics from the industry tells us that because users would not use them by definition makes it so that the only thing that is huge is their cost investment but the return on that cost is not that why you see hundreds of memes of people complaining about how fallout dialogue options went from long choices to yes and no one word replies when the data from the industry indicates that players skip over a massive amount of dialogue and choices so writing it is a waste of time but not writing it does not affect your game sales that why you get things like the mass effect 3 ending that people hated because the metrics showed that less than half the people even had save imports to mass effect 2 so writing special endings with impactful choices into mass effect 3 ending would account for less than a quarter of your playerbase if the statistics bore out but would mean a ridiculous amount of investment into cg video and voice acting talent for separate scenarios ,2,heroesofthestorm

rainzer,yes it is weird that is not for dispute but we have archaeological evidence that the chinese used glass to make ritualistic drinking vessels found in burial tombs so it not like they did not use the glass they had to make glassware so the idea of tea seems like a strange conclusion we also know that they had the general or basic idea of optics lenses we know that the chinese invented or at least used sunglasses as they used quartz for ancient magistrates we also know that this period where they had these ideas resulted in a warring period where translating these ideas into telescopes would have been useful on the battlefield so all we have is speculation as to why this never went forward we know there was a chemical difference between the type of glass the ancient chinese made lead vs silica glass but lead glass if advanced further would result in crystal which would at least be useful for lens making which never happened ,11,Showerthoughts

rainzer, well your example is something that pretty subjective all of the sections of the guidelines that list strict punishment are ones that are reliably consistently enforced ones that are a bit more subjective are as you have noted less consistently enforced which is a wacky argument because all you have to do is look at the wording for example the dress code does not have specific punishments as you stated but says is prohibited but this also applies to illegal activity things that break the law because this is what it says for breaking the law while on twitch stream you must respect all applicable local national and international laws while using our services any content or activity featuring encouraging or soliciting illegal activity is prohibited no strict punishment as you say it just says is prohibited so are you arguing that according to twitch it is worse to threaten to swat someone than actually breaking a law while on stream because the latter would be arbitrarily enforced based on your it does not have a strict punishment listed style of enforcement because the only things that list a specific punishment is impersonating twitch staff evading a suspension and harassment so everything else according to you would be random enforcement including broadcasting child porn actually killing people or doxxing someone on stream lol did you not actually read the rules ,-10,leagueoflegends

rainzer,at this point people seemed to have been able to confirm 3 ways a character can have their stats end up completely balanced 1 bonus 3 neutral 1 penalty or 2 bonus 1 neutral 2 penalty so the idea is each character supposedly has a version that is the best maybe it one where the character gets a bonus to two important stats and penalties to two stats that do not matter to the character that version of the character will always outperform every other version for example that 30 page arena guide put forth the current fotm theory that a speed boon hector is the best hector so it would be a hector with the 1 3 1 where he would have the stat bonus applied to speed 3 neutral stats and 1 stat that gets a slight penalty ,6,FireEmblemHeroes

rainzer, i have seen both i agree it was not the most tactful response but he pretty clearly was not sniping at jw team do not talk shit if you cannot take it back diablo butthurt fanbase decided to be offended for him for shit he fucked up if diablo fanbase cannot take shit talking then do not have anyone start it schaefer did not and so we never hear about schaefer diablo fanbase though thrives on salt and drama rather than actually giving a shit about facts or reality for a group of people that promote how hardcore they are playing one death arpgs some of the thinnest skins for a community marvel heroes seems to be pretty successful so i am not quite sure what you mean http steamcharts com app 226320 12k peak release day f2p mmo ,-5,Diablo
rainzer, and he even said it in a way that was clearly not meant to be a dig at jw or his team compare brevik way of answering the question and schaefer when asked about diablo 3 brevik is a clear i am not racist but statement other major difference schaefer actually released successful games afterwards and does not try to inject his diablo history into everything he lets other people do it for him brevik does it himself like when brevik was asked about marvel heroes i left and i wanted to do something different i had learned that the marvel license had been taken i m a huge marvel fan so i sought out the job to actually say i want to make marvel diablo and take some of the lessons i ve learned doing mythos and some of the early design stuff i d done on diablo 3 and then all of my experience with diablo 1 and 2 and try and harness that and make it into a true mmo and add the marvel ip on top yea man marvel diablo ,-2,Diablo
rainzer, like many devs that become successful he left a larger company to create his own independent studio he left because vivendi which was funding the creation of d3 at the time told them they were fucking it up and cancelled it he had the funding and backing to make the game he wanted he failed and he threw a tantrum to make his own company to go ahead and release another incomplete game to prove vivendi was correct in not continuing to throw money into this fucker facts ,6,Diablo
rainzer, seriously how do you take over an ip screw it up except brevik screwed it up first if he had not jay wilson would have never been the d3 lead this is brevik fuck up he commented that d3 was not the game he would have made well fuck him he had the chance to make the game he was going to make he did not and blizzard pulled him and he sabotaged the project by leaving and taking the north people with him so to have him attempt to try to get reflected glory fuck that loser but hey do not let facts get in the way of your horseshit ,4,Diablo
rainzer,if diablo players were not so quick to get butthurt and try to assume it meant more than what it was insulting brevik was completely valid brevik was and still is trying to attention whore over being on a team for a game that was released nearly 20 years ago and has not seen success since so any chance he gets he just talks diablo like remember that time i made diablo yea i do then you were failing at making d3 and left in a tantrum to make the commercial failure that was hellgate london any other person that did this shit would be rightfully laughed at and ridiculed but nah but muh d2s ,14,Diablo
rainzer, logically leoric and azmodan target the soul of their victims so it does not matter what you do as long as you stay in their range your soul will get punished if this is the argument then whenever i play stitches i should be immune to azmodan and leoric since undead do not have souls same goes for auriel since angels do not have souls ,2,heroesofthestorm

rainzer, it will be abused in what way apparently everything that makes the experience slightly better or reduces the time you have to play a game with an ai bot this community is violently against and feels everyone will abuse it it such a friendly game but hidden in the shadows are people who abuse the game apparently and we must masochistically sit through afkers leavers and dcs so the 0 00001 of assholes that might abuse it cannot no thanks give me surrender safe leave remakes i think the games in the genre that have been around for over a decade at least has something right ,5,heroesofthestorm

rainzer,i never said it was racism it was asked why there would need to be a site for blacks to have a higher chance to match with blacks you implied a racist tone ,-1,nottheonion
rainzer,ya it is consider what i said and look back at the numbers all races tend to be sympathetic to their own race but whites are most sympathetic to their own race except black men thus non white people are shit in comparison for example a white man rates a white woman with a 10 an asian woman is a 6 a black woman a 18 and a latina is a 2 so for a white man all non whites are at least 4 points worse minimum for a white woman rating people it worse with white men rating 17 while latino men sit at 1 asian men at 12 and black men at 6 so to a white woman every non white man is at least 16 points worse therefore nothing i said was incorrect white people think non white people are shit in comparison and since whites are the majority of the country they also are the most represented on dating websites statistically ,7,nottheonion
rainzer,yea because the theory of any build using shenlong is that you replace pure ability to take a few hits with loh instead so the idea is git gud and do not get hit so much but punch things to heal yourself if you do ,1,Diablo3Monks
rainzer,because the data from all the largest dating sites say that white people think non white people are shit in comparison no matter what they actually say and as a result after having that data consistently for like 7 years they stopped releasing it because it made online dating look bad and instead turned it into some feel good infographics like x percent of people like sushi ,30,nottheonion

rainzer, i have not watched the video yet does his team acknowledge they liked his decisions or does he say it his quote ultimately the best judge of a system sometimes is how the team feels when you take it away most of the time there is protest people like features especially ones that are already implemented with the talisman the team was just relieved when it was gone and that told us loud and clear that removing it was the right decision i see no reason he would bullshit this part any member of the team can call him out on it for damaging a currently live product huge lawsuit and he out of the game industry so he can say whatever he wants and not care about future job prospects if he wants to blame his team truthfully to me it also telling it was never considered to add back the talisman or all this depth when they did the mea culpa redo with loot 2 0 with ros nor with the development of necromancer they have the opportunity to but are still choosing not to that says volumes i think jay wilson just served serves as an easy fall guy like every single thing wrong with d3 was his fault i think if he as qualified as blizzard believes he was and you do not give away one of your big three to some nobody i think he too would wish he could be faulted for everything and say every decision made about the game was on him so he could know in hindsight that all it took was him personally making a different decision for everyone to be satisfied on some level i hate the guy because a part of me will always be salty having preordered d3 collector and having grown up on diablo d2 but i know enough of the industry to also know it not all his fault ,11,Diablo
rainzer,what if you build the operator ,5,funny
rainzer,except from his own answers it was the entire team that supported the decisions you had the opportunity to go for deeper with the ex blizzard north guys in hellgate london but no one did even poe who people keep saying did arpg justice did a more streamlined arpg than what the talisman d2 charms was so to say people inherently dislike removal of convoluted bullshit is flawed ,25,Diablo
rainzer, the game would not be a fucking ghosttown i am sure you have the internal numbers for how many players across every platform is currently playing diablo no one is playing it that why rather than reassigning all the developer talent they put it into developing the necromancer for it instead oh wait no you do not you are full of shit ,11,Diablo
rainzer, they estimated that only 25 of the player base would be pvping so it wasnt a priority well i got news for you if 25 of 30 millons players would have kept playing for pvp then diablo 3 would be so fucking populated right now list a single multiplayer game with a strong single player experience that has thrived exclusively on it pvp playerbase you wo not find one because your claim is absolute horseshit they are not going to throw away billions of dollars over some angry guy on the forum when they have all the telemetry and metrics from across the industry over decades to say you could not be more fucking wrong if targeting pvpers for rpgs was where the money and player retention was at every fucking publisher would be pushing pvp in every game until you could not stand it bunch of armchair game developers with no industry experience throwing around bullshit ,31,Diablo

rainzer, the more i realize they really were not fans of the diablo series they were mere window shoppers of it that fairly harsh criticism i am not sure where you are getting it from based on what he even saying your shit is like a middle school english class trying to bullshit some symbolism out of nothing to write your 3 page essay these guys were tasked with taking on one of blizzard 3 game franchises but having almost none of the original blizzard north team the only game designer level guy that was still involved is wyatt and wyatt is a technical designer not a creative designer so from the start the diablo 3 team had none of the blizzard north creative guys but were tasked with attempting to replicate the entire universe of diablo big words why do not you try it if you believe you are more than a window shopper do a complete write up of the spirit of diablo and nail it post it on pastebin and let see your fan level of accuracy as opposed to window shopper level so we can all dissect it ,-16,Diablo
rainzer, then they do not get to complain when necro sells less than 5m next year and hypocrites like you will still be buying it anyway but will be mysteriously silent when it does sell 5 million units because you guys are cowards that have yet to prove you have any ability to do anything but cry on the internet have a tissue baby ,1,Diablo

rainzer, not sure if they were just unaware of the event or were purposely running off with the object i know an event was going on i did not know what the fuck the event was when it spawned for me all i could gather was that there was a 30 second timer and the first 5 seconds you could not even use because you were still loading and locked and there was an arrow pointing to a random location but did not say what to do with it if you went to it the quest for the event just says run the rooster race around the nexus for all i knew you just had to run around the fuckin nexus on your chicken mount 25 times for some unknown reason ,5,heroesofthestorm
rainzer,you have such a hard on trying to claim this if they wanted they could have started selling stash tabs like poe and selling pets like wow instead of putting them on the menagerist goblins so why have not they where your evidence except your crying ,1,Diablo
rainzer,your tinfoil hat is on so fucking tight i think you have brain damage no legitimate company would endorse your purchase of their intellectual property from an illegitimate third party your idea that they should help you when you fuck that shit up hilariously absurd you believe they changed their tune but they never did it was always about not having people scammed you just assumed it was about protecting the player it was not it is not it never will be it about not having to spend extra resources on customer support to help idiots like you it took a while to implement p2w into their games and starcraft was an exception which is why i said almost all and not all of their games the fact that you can only point to a single exception makes my point more than it does yours even more fucking absurd how dumb are you until your supposed timeline of when blizzard merged with activision blizzard had only three games warcraft starcraft diablo starcraft did not get monetized warcraft did not get monetized until 2013 that 5 years after your supposed lol activision did it diablo 3 we know was not touched by team 5 and was not developed until at least 2 years after the activision merger so basically your only evidence is hearthstone and overwatch which were 4 years after the activision merger and by all indications are the exceptions good job being full of shit ,3,Diablo
