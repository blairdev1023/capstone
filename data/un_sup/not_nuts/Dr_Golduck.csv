Dr_Golduck,first ever royal flush hit it in a 1 2 cash game i am in the game for 210 and have 300 to start the hand i am big blind with 3 limpers and sb completing i look at aqh and make it 11 and all 4 people call flop comes jh 10h 6s sb checks i check man bets 35 gets 2 callers sb folds original better and callers are not good players based on reads i think no one has a set i figure someone may have j10 but that leaves me with 12 outs realistically 10 bc one caller probably has flush draw too as original raiser i thought check raising and going all in would push everyone out so i do it original raiser calls his whole stack had him covered by like 15 on aj top pair one folds one calls his remaining 55 shit i gotta hit but my queen is good too turn is a blank and the river is the kh giving me a royal and winning a close to 800 pot with a 50 high hand paying out about 10 hands later i buy a round for my friends that are drinking and take a round off and enjoy hitting my first royal later i lose against a couple of draws for big pots and ready to leave up almost 500 but my buddy who rode with me was stuck and wanted to keep playing so i stay i play smart my reads are on point and i ended up cashing out 1039 829 up for my best cash of 2017 thanks for reading ,42,poker

Dr_Golduck,8 years ish there was one year i only rolled twice and about 15 months completely drug free when i deployed over seas when i was 17 23 li would roll about 8 15 times a year once 2 days in a row and rarely anything shorter than 2 weeks unless something super awesome made it so i could not wait killer concerts or frisky young ladies my average roll when younger was around 100 300mg with another half to whole redose the same night my only changes in experiences really is that i now do a 150mg to start always bc 100mg is like ok i feel slightly euphoric but at 150 the magic happens and when it hits i am like yo pass me that vicks help me open these 100 glow sticks who needs gum i got three types to choose from fuck it take a pack i gotta go dance there were a couple years where i tripped on mushrooms and lsd frequently 50 100 times each year and was taking lots of uppers and during this time my rolls did not seem to last as long as they should and seemed slightly weaker than usual and i think there was probably some cross tolerance after reducing my tripping to only once or twice a year the rolls regained the magic ,2,MDMA

Dr_Golduck,that is not a different topic as what you previously stated and this comment only makes you look less intelligent oxycontin xr can be filled as it generic of oxycodone xr er are you an esl student you may think and possibly know what you are talking about but your grasp of the english language makes me either think you are trying to bullshit or you are a non native english speaker also 3 5 may be the average you also did not specify what u mean by average bc average has multiple meanings as well but not the legally acceptable difference allowed in a generic i do agree with you that it can go either way or ,1,science
Dr_Golduck,why u getting downvoted for putting someone in their place ask any addict if they can tell a difference in a name brand versus a generic back in the early 2000s you could shoot up oxycontin but not generic oxys that is just an example to prove your point source not a user but generics were 25 cheaper to buy but only 10 cheaper to sell current example subutex vs suboxone both are used to treat opiate withdrawal one is generic but when u take it you can still get high off opiates the other has naloxone in it ,1,science

Dr_Golduck,ding ding ding we have a winner yes there is a limit to the monetary value of gifts given to doctors staff etc but they leave free samples of their drugs if an insured patient feels they suffer symptoms of x but the doctor either does not know nor does not spend enough time to figure or they are psychosomatic they think u think u have something wrong so here is a 5 day free sample of y drug 5 days later omg that drug is a life saver can i be prescribed it doctor let me run some tests i will need some blood samples the nurse will get those from you and i will be back to see you change scene outside the room doctor yo nurse take 3 capsules of blood from patient fat fuck while i run his insurance doctor finds out oh shit this drug i gave them free samples of are 600 a month and 590 is covered by insurance there 300 and each 200 visit is 100 covered by insurance back in the room doctor says good news is i am glad the medicine i gave you worked and i will prescribe it to you unfortunately with this medication you will have to come in every month for blood tests so i can monitor makeup some bullshit medical term level cholesterol glucose etc but on the positive side your insurance covers 100 of your visits and you just owe 10 a month for the medications patient wow thanks doc you are the best next month patient comes for the visit sees the doc says everything is doing so much better doc says good to hear let get your blood samples and you can be on your way we will call you if anything comes up cue insurance being billed for a visit 3 blood tests and a medication that has no generic tests are never done bc they are unnecessary tl dr insurance fraud pharmaceutical company gets paid doctor gets paid pharmacy gets paid and then years later when it recalled late night infomercial layers get paid during the class action lawsuit where the victims get fucked again and the lawyers make money ,1,science

Dr_Golduck,non expert with very limited knowledge here i bought pearls when i was in qatar everything is cheap there with the exchange rate compared to american dollars almost 4 qatari riyals for 1 it was 3 71 1 american dollar things like food were about 2x in qr compared to american dollars so about half off i bought an 8x4 rug from their equivalent of wall mart for 10 qr a hookah which would be about 200 in the states i got for 60 qr less than 20 so i was recommended to buy pearls during my 2 5 days in qatar nothing has a price tag and you can haggle on everything i bought my mom a triple ring necklace triple ring bracelets 2 and matching earring set with red pearls 90 normal pearls but 5 6 pearls per row in the necklace was red 3 per row in the bracelet and 1 5 in the earrings were red for 200 qr i was being ripped off and did not even try to haggle if i bought it in america it would cost 500 1000 no need to haggle bc i only had limited shopping time and it was about 10 20 retail price in the states well over there and most places farm pearls by putting sand or more likely a small sphere inside the animal and grow pearls the quality is not perfect and they are farmed and take everything and sell it bc it nature very few have nice spherical shape and amazing iridescence they get harvested when the size is appropriate for jewelry and then re sanded to grow another bc of this cultured pearls are so much cheaper and freshwater pearls are so much more expensive think the difference between farmed fish and wild caught wild caught fish are so much harder to get and also can get much larger bc the earth limits their size whereas at a fish farm their food is so limited their top size is limited not only by food but also at when they are harvested so in pearl since every cultured pearl comes from a certain foreign substance where wild pearls can come from any foreign substance which leads to only so much variance in size and clarity and size of the animal is limited by the food given to them in captivity if this helped you understand pearls a little better respond or pm me with a dad joke thanks plur,3,AskReddit

Dr_Golduck,i am a professional card dealer i deal poker for a living and it takes me approx 9 10 seconds to do seven riffles 60 cards and sleeves make it way harder to shuffle than plastic playing cards box cuts take even longer than a riffle when i shuffle i do 3 4 riffles and smash bc mtg cards have sleeves box cut repeat repeat and cut instead of a 3rd box cut we are talking 20secs min and typically closer to 30 before i present to my opponent who often takes longer if i crack 2 fetches in a game that at least 2 min of shuffling just on my deck i respectfully disagree with your comment,1,magicTCG
Dr_Golduck,that what i think too either start at origins or bfz bc bfz would be no core sets if one allure is how it cheaper than modern making the lands for any viable deck cost 200 bc of fetches completely ruins the format for me i like the idea of a new format but i hate fetches i do not want 10 minutes of my match being shuffling bc my opponent and i both crack multiple fetches each game ,1,magicTCG

Dr_Golduck,best response so far personally the arbitrary starting point i know the art changed is what diassappoints me mostly because one supposedly big appeal about frontier is how cheap it is but it had fetches if your lands cost 200 then it is not a cheap format if they ban fetches or start at a different point then i think i will start playing ,1,magicTCG

Dr_Golduck,no i am saying multiple times prior to 2009 so 2000ish on when i stopped playing bc i moved out of my parents i had looked online for high scores i had not looked through my old nintendo powers looking for scores bc the internet existed in the many times i looked through multiple search engines and forums i had not seen a score over 500k and my highest at the time was 525k so about a year later when i crossed over 600k i have done that twice i did not bother looking i did not take a digital picture of my regular film picture and upload it to the internet i did not tell people i did not brag about it except to my mom bc that who i competed with for high score she cracked 500k before me and when u get to 20 years old you really do not give a fuck about your high score from a game 20 years old and forget about it until you see a random fact on reddit that surprises you and you are like damn the woz is better than me that pretty neat and you comment on an internet thread instead of being asked for proof i just got downvoted so apparently at least 8 people the woz have higher scores than me ,1,todayilearned

Dr_Golduck,i mostly agree but by being a spike you will often come off as an a hole whether you are trying to or not telling someone they are wrong and their deck is bad is almost always going to come off a holeish even if you have good intentions and thought your post was friendly criticism people may read it in their mind as really mean so unfortunately spike and a hole will be seen synonymously at times but i think most of the time this sub is great about advice deck building and discussion especially when someone follows the rules ex they have a deck with lots of practice against the meta explanation for card choices and why they are a 1 4 or sideboard this is where i think spikes thrives i disagree with the bad advice you see repeated and being picked up by new players that why we have upvotes and downvotes and i feel most advice whether good or bad gets up or down voted appropriately i love this sub and am usually not spiky enough or knowledgeable to comment a lot due to the fact i do not get to play as much as i would like but i get tons of good info that has definitely helped me win more thanks spikes,-1,spikes

Dr_Golduck,meth and mushrooms are not synergystic meth is a stimulant used to treat adhd and narcolepsy stimulants increase brain function mushrooms on the other hand inhibit certain brain functions such as parasympathetic nervous system iirc so the combination of the two are counter productive for the trippy aspects of mushrooms both meth and mushrooms are strong neurotransmitter agonists of serotonin leading to an increased body high but likely are not dangerous together if you want to combo these two wonderful drugs for increased hallucinations wait to take your mushrooms until after at least one if not multiple days of not sleeping from meth and when the meth wears off take your magic mushrooms the sleep deprivation pairs well with the visual hallucinations caused by mushrooms and can greatly intensify them remember folks timing is crucial when combining meth and mushrooms and can lead to different states of euphoria choose wisely ,33,mildlyinteresting

Dr_Golduck,i got in trouble for taking up trays at lunch i would take up other people trays at lunch for 10 cents a piece i would sit at a different table every week bc i was super friendly and goofy it was a good way to build a customer base and spread the word of what i was doing i eventually became our class clown as a senior the students loved it bc it was so cheap they did not care and they did not have to walk the 10 50ft to the trashcan and could keep talking with their friends the vice principal loved it because he was cool and thought it was neat and innovative the custodians loved it because it made their job easier the principal and chemistry teacher hated it because well i do not really know i guess it was because they were assholes my junior year year i made over 1000 doing it i was so successful and loved by the lunchroom they became saddened when they learned i was moving to the other lunch time because of my school schedule i could not let down my loyal customers and enlisted my buddy to take over that lunch shift i even convinced him to give me 10 franchise fee because i built the customer base and that lunch had about 25 more people then comes senior year of course i am going to continue my lunch business i pretty buff bc i lifted everyday and played sports i also wore a bright pink barbie backpack why some may ask well i was our class clown so why not wear a barbie backpack my tray business started out strong in fact better than last year things were going great for about a month until i got called into the principal office i was told that some freshman he would not name complained that i the guy wearing a barbie backpack was too intimidating and they felt they couldnt say no to the big senior so i would have to shut down my tray business my 10 cent a tray business the principal thought he outsmarted me and had won down but not defeated i decided the i could not let him win he showed up at lunch the next day to make sure i was not charging money to take up trays as he smuggly watched i went to the front of thd cafeteria and yelled to get everyones attention i informed them i will be taking trays up for free for anyone who asked i looked at the principal who smug look was replaced by a now befuddled look because now what could he do i had achieved victory after a few days of free trays for my regular customers i would only freely take up trays that had money left on thr tray it became more like a forced donation of 10 cent but technically free my parents got the letter from the school saying i was sent to the principal and i almost got in trouble for it but i had already told them what was going on tl dr go read it its a good clean story,1,AskReddit
