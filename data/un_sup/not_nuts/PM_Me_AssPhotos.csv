PM_Me_AssPhotos,is it a shit choice though lefou being gay makes total sense why he would be obsessed with gaston gaston is the most handsome strongest most good looking guy in the town he so handsome even men find him attractive lefou being gay makes total sense and explains why he just does everything to be in the vicinity of gaston no one else is openly gay in the story so it seems naturally lefou is going to want to be near gaston since he has no interest in women so who to say lefou has to be the bumbling idiot he was in the cartoon what if he just pathetically in love with gaston not just an admirer what if he the equivalent of the high school girl stereotype falling in love with the stud qb annie and troy on community pitting him in this role in a gay way is really clever imo it plays that trope in a new light and makes you realize gaston uses his looks to get what he wants literally with anyone men or women it also builds into gaston thing of hes so attractive even men go gay for him but belle does not care about that she about inner beauty and the soul inside someone gaston has no effect on her i am curious to see how it played out if lefou actually moves on beyond gaston and finds another man to be with or if it just that he got that puppy love crush on gaston the movie seems to be pretty progressive ,2,funny

PM_Me_AssPhotos,i have seen and played with people for the past 10 years that grew up playing basketball and have worked with them on their hands to be good mb with a libero style players i dont know more than 10 20 d1 male athletes but the ones i know are not idiots you make d1 because you are a cog in the wheel not a sprocket you have to know what to do on the court for a lot of d1 kids they are 18 19 years old knowing what to do on the court by 18 19 being mentally developed enough to know what to do and not be selfish that what separates them from someone at 25 35 years old height is a huge requirement but unlike football basketball where you can post a 900 sat score and make alabama or kentucky you actually have to think and squad up the 1 issue i see with mb is not knowing how to react to their setter path to the ball and getting to a place where they can still hit from the middle volleyball is a team game and you might be the best person in your state at your position but if your team cannot pass or serve they are essentially taking your shoes off for you so to op question learn every facet of every position setters need to understand their limitations and understand the best plays for the balls they are getting passed hitters need to be able to adjust their approaches to anything shitty coach once said as a platitude a good hitter can hit any ball liberos have to be the voice box secretary of the defense and tell the team what is going on each play so simply put understand every players roles and responsibilities if you know what everyone is supposed to do you can put yourself in their shoes and understand why they were not able to perform xyz rather than griefing because you are head and shoulders better than your team eg these sets are shit well why is that setter response because the passes are shit well why is that back row response because the front row defense cannot block for shit well why is that front row response because we dont know ahead of time that the setter is live or that the backrow has a solid attack libero response well the coach never mentioned that in the huddle team response fuck this coach joking but you see my point hopefully the buck can always be passed because it a team game be the strongest link in the chain ,9,volleyball

PM_Me_AssPhotos,you can repo houses easily just like how you can cars they are very similar in that sense what you cannot repo with cars that you can with houses is houses retain or grow their value over years cars literally get driven into the ground cars driven off the lot lose 20 40 of their value from new if ford or gm or vw audi or whoeverthefuck gives you a credit line of 40k for that new vehicle the second you drive off the lot you have lost 15 on your investment money that wo not come back unless you sell it to jay leno and then he sells it or something similar houses retain value and property has intrinsic value that cars do not cars have scrap value and a running car has a flatline value of about 3 000 but unlike homes which can be mcmansioned from 120 000 into 500 000 or just sat on for years like slumlords do with them cars do not have that luxury they are depreciable assets they naturally lose value year over year regardless of use especially considering the level of vehicle we are currently discussing you are acting like the bank credit agency can just repo the 30 000 car that someone paid 10 of 36 payments on over a 3 year period out of 60 that car repo would with 40 000 miles is maybe worth 15 18 000 and the owner has paid off let say at a 500 mo they have paid down 5000 on a loan of 30 000 with the asset now worth an appraised low end 15 000 yeah it are coverable because it has wheels and a gps unit right but the fact is the car does not recover it value it not a whole write off which is why using your logic i am sure they drank the same kool aid which is why it so fucking toxic like ipecac they are like wellllll not 30 of people are going to default the market is up incomes are up blahblah no that bad math poor people are poor for a reason sub prime is sub prime for a reason you might not have the flawed incentives that the housing market had but i guarantee you you have similar incentives at car dealerships that fannie and freddie had let say 50 of people default and you recover the cars asp of 30 000 with average deliquncy of 24 months and repo after 3 years essentially the bank gets 5k on a 30 000 loan repo the asset with a market value of half it loan value and the bank is now underwater 10 000 on a car that wo not appreciate they have to write off essentially a third of the entire portfolio of those loans which at 50 of the encompassing portfolio is a sixth of the that portfolio of the loans when you give such low rates the sub prime candidates that are paying down their loans in these cases are getting rates at like 5 7 versus the loan sharks that get like 25 300 apr which to the creditors is like fuck it we are getting 025 from the fed roll the dice on these broke ass people problem being they are losing a lot of money more than they intended because of that flawed math and mentality and they needed to move cars and used cars were selling more than new cars because new cars are expensive as fuck and everyone from kiplinger to suzy orman was saying buy cpo off a new lease would o not pay depreciation it like every major bubble a pain in the ass to explain there are so many variables ,1,explainlikeimfive

PM_Me_AssPhotos,i am not sure how to respond clearly tesla customers and jc penny shoppers are a very small intersection of a venn digram it has been proven many times over that coupons induce sales if you are a thrifty spender like me you are aware of a website called camelcamelcamel which tracks prices across the internet if you have a 20 off coupon would you buy an item maybe but what if the price was artificially raised 20 before they released the coupon you would not know without some kind way of tracking it the point there is with your coupon you know you have got your haggling done ahead of time you know you have a better deal than the shmuck next to you i forget who the comedian is but someone made a joke about how literally everyone gets a coupon to bed bath and beyond if you dont have one at the register they have one for you why not lower the price across the board because people want need those coupons before they part with their cash it stupid but it true ,1,teslamotors

PM_Me_AssPhotos,http www edmunds com car care stop changing your oil html among 2013 models the majority of automakers call for oil changes at either 7 500 or 10 000 miles based on a normal service schedule more than double the traditional 3 000 mile interval the longest oil change interval is 15 000 miles for all jaguar vehicles the shortest oil change interval is 5 000 miles in some hyundai and kia models with turbo engines and toyota vehicles that call for non synthetic oil toyota has been shifting its fleet to 10 000 mile oil change intervals using synthetic oil i apologize to the good people of hyundai if i got it wrong it appears it was jaguar and i think this might have been jaguar when they were owned by ford all i remember was the interval was crazy high ,2,pics
PM_Me_AssPhotos,so my point was the owner manual is not necessarily best practices even though the term best practices is what is commonly used to illustrate what the manufacturer recommends because it what is most likely to cover their ass in case of abuse or mistreatment sometimes the owners manual is not written by the person that designed the engine rather it may be interfered with or impacted by the marketing department in the situation i gave the manufacturer did a recall or what was a are printing of the owners manuals to correct that but had the owner not been aware they would be likely to ruin their engine simply by following the owners manual as you had recommended i was merely trying to illustrate a time when that not the best idea ,1,pics
PM_Me_AssPhotos,that actually wrong iirc hyundai changed their are commended intervals to once every 15 000 miles from 10 000 miles and it caused a lot of problems the reasoning was its synthetic and if they were able to space out their oil changes every 15 versus 10 and cover the car for 60k miles rather than say 30 or 45 like the competitors they could presumably get by with a better warranty not pay as much for bs service like an oil change and convince their customers they are providing a better warranty it backfired and they ended up changing their recommendation back to 10 000 which as pretty much anyone on reddit will tell you is really pushing it synthetic tops out around 7500 miles the nomenclature is every 3000 miles or 6 months so no it not always best to go by the manual sometimes the manual is done with marketing and bottom line in mind mechanics know what goes wrong most often and there nothing wrong with changing your oil after every drive except it an obvious waste of oil and oil filters ,1,pics

PM_Me_AssPhotos,not entirely true her shirt seems to get caught on fire if she dropped to the ground and began to roll the fire would not travel up to her face she sits there vertically kicking her legs if she dropped to the floor to roll the fire would have largely missed her face i am not saying she would not have been burned but she basically went from being on fire to then standing over a pile of lighter fluid soaked t shirts i have to imagine anything that is going to catch fire this rapidly and quickly is going to burn off equally as fast but if you spray that catalyst on something easier to burn non skin material like a t shirt or newspaper it will catch fire and continue to burn stop drop and roll would have had the effect of standing six inches to the left of bbq grill rather than six inches above the bbq grill still hot still burning but you are getting the full brunt of the heat being above it rather than being to the side ,1,WTF
