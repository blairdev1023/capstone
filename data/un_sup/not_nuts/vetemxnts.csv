vetemxnts,rinse off with pressure washer snowfoam them and rinse then i snowfoam again use a brush rinse off spray on wheel tire cleaner and let it sit for about 2 minutes hit it with the brush again and then power wash all the brake dust and dirt away happy wheels just make sure you have a soft brush so you dont scratch them ,1,Mustang
vetemxnts,i was looking into that to but was not sure traditional clay bar when one side is dirty i flip it to the clean side i cut 1 bar into 3 so i have 6 fresh sides to use the griots one its just one side do not you run the risk of scratching the car once its full of contaminates ,1,Mustang
vetemxnts,thanks and i feel you on that i bought mine used and it had scratches everywhere but luckily it was only the clearcoat so it was an easy fix theres one deep scratch on the rear bumper that i am going to get professional fixed sometime soon i like buying my cars used but it sucks some people do not care about their paint its a shame ,1,Mustang
vetemxnts,i have the matcc cannon and i assume all cannons are the same as for soap i have been jumping around i am using the chemical guys maxi suds ii super suds and i love it i will be trying adams soap next ,1,Mustang
vetemxnts,i fell in love with the fp6 but this is actually just the premium because i waned the in dash computer and track apps but then i added the louvers myself and got the amr black wheels so it looks like the fp6 just with the premium added ,2,Mustang
vetemxnts,thanks me too that what sold me on the 2014,2,Mustang
vetemxnts,do not forget though that 13 cad is only 9 55 usd ,1,OldSchoolCool
vetemxnts,i cannot be the only one thinking he was trying to put the flame out with telekinesis ,1,aww
vetemxnts,wow the yellow looks beautiful especially with those wheels ,2,Mustang
vetemxnts,was going to mention lemon law but in your state they do not work with used cars here in massachusetts if you buy a used car and it shits the bed within 14 days without prior knowledge of a problem you can get your money back or have the issue fixed at previous owner dealers expense ,7,personalfinance
vetemxnts,this speaks to me on a spiritual level i wake up for work at 645 every monday through friday i go to bed roughly 1am cannot fall asleep earlier or i feel as if i am missing out on precious awake time internet fun so during the week i am sleeping by 1am and up at 645am and i am yawning all day and non stop tiredness from the minute i wake up on the weekends though i am falling asleep 4am and waking up at 10am completely refreshed and not feeling tired at all it very frustrating ,1,Showerthoughts
vetemxnts,looking for a reply to this also just took mine out of the garage and noticed the hood had a few small bubble areas but no rust ugh ,3,Mustang
vetemxnts,i like where theyre going but i dont want the respawn timer to be longer on brs and light rifles maybe bump them back 20 seconds but any more than that will suck ,0,halo
vetemxnts,are people forgetting something wasnt it halo fall finals or something in november envy made it to the finals against optic and had to beat them twice to win optic was in winners bracket envy in losers first bo7 went to game 7 envy won 2nd time around also went to game 7 envy won this hwc optic vs envy again and 3 out of 4 of the games envy had the lead and then choked they just need more practice i dont think splitting up would benefit anyone ,7,halo
vetemxnts,the only sounds i thoroughly enjoy in halo 5 is sound it makes when you get a headshot the peerrrfect ,2,halo
vetemxnts,give me maps with meaning not this flat layouts with a few jumps and blocks everywhere i want maps like a lockout guardian the pit zanzibar last resort high ground even those maps above with halo 5 movements would still be unreal ,2,halo
vetemxnts,not necessarily i have overpushed a few times and in my head i knew a ninja could be coming you need to play with strategy so i was in this situation of the player you killed and once i would see you blip on my radar and jump i would immediately thrust away you outplayed him and thats his fault that was a good play,1,halo
vetemxnts,but like i said has nothing to do with autos thats spartan abilities which is a whole different topic ,0,halo
vetemxnts,okay but spartan charge can kill you instantly anyways and if someone has the time to sprint at you you should have enough time to shoot them before they get to you unless you dont see them then yeah you deserved to be spartan charged also a spartan charge and 1 headshot will kill you also so irrelevant has nothing to do with autos ,1,halo
vetemxnts,then do not have your pistol out in a close range battle like i said sure some things can be nerfed but what do you want magnum ar starts with no weapons on the map besides the power weapons like what do you want to see ideally ,-4,halo
vetemxnts,yeah i feel you they recently came out and said the ranking in halo 5 uses the same system from halo 3 which i dont believe at all the 10 placement matches are bogus it makes players diamond rank that really belong in the golds i have played games where a diamond 5 will go 3 17 in slayer i will check their stats and see their overall kda is like a 3 0 yet they are in diamond i dont know why they didnt start everyone off at level 1 or bronze 1 and just had people climb their way up this way it separates those that really do not belong in high ranks in team slayer my 10 placement matches will be against and with high diamond onyx players lets say i win 6 10 because like i said theres a lot of shit high ranks so i win 6 10 games against onyx and diamond yet it will place me platinum 3 i will never understand their system ,7,halo
vetemxnts,i think autos are fine tbh you start with ar and magnum autos are all over maps you either pick them up or you dont know how to use them or you dont i used to strictly only use magnum and found myself losing close range battles so what did i do i learned to pull out my ar auto when i knew someone was near by i then started winning most of my close range battles so its not an autos are op omg problem its a player problem learn when and how to use autos there a time and place for everything because at mid range i will have someone shooting me with a storm or ar ill turn around and reversal them with my magnum because in that situation autos dont work well just need to learn and adapt,-4,halo
vetemxnts,i need number ranks from halo 2 back colored numbers and a better ui pregame lobbies no 10 placement match bs straight up start as level 1 and work your way up ,1,halo
vetemxnts,at first i was 100 against sprint hated it wanted nothing to do with it that being said i loved halo 2 3 and would take those over halo 5 any day of the week but i have adapted and i feel they made sprint functional in this game to slide you need to sprint to spartan charge you need to sprint it also helps with long jumps and clambering getting shot and think you can sprint out of the situation think again shields do not recharge now while your sprinting with no shields until you stop i am chasing you and called out to my teammates who can hopefully pick you off from a different sightline the only things i want back from halo 2 3 is the ui and ranking in pregame lobbies i want to see ranks i want to see whos on red blue team when on my friends list i want to see everyones top rank and i also want number ranks back i think the metal ranks are tacky as hell there was nothing more satisfying than level up from a 36 in halo 2 which was a 36 wrapped in purple and yellow to a 37 that was wrapped in purple and blue i need those back ,13,halo
vetemxnts,loved the bit on the 1 50 h3 scale i personally would rather have the halo 2 number ranks i am a high plat low diamond which says i am about a 45 50 in h3 terms and i was a 49 in h3 but there something much more satisfying about seeing a 45 50 rank rather than a plat 3 or plat 4 especially halo 2 the ranks 37 39 with the purple and blue were beautiful good times honestly though if these metal ranks did not look so bland i would probably like it more idk you are saying it goes off h3 ranks then there should be a vote on if it should stay metal ranks or number ranks 50s could have a showing how much higher they are ,1,halo
vetemxnts,aaaaaaaand this is why i have my radar detector sure it doesnt work 100 of the time but damn near works 99 of the time they are basically the cost of one hefty speeding ticket and they are well worth it that being said i do not drive crazy speeds to begin with just fast enough to get to where i am going without having to pretend i am on a sunday cruise ,1,Mustang
vetemxnts,can you please point me to where in the code book it says a little sliced insulation requires a full rewire thanks,-1,electricians
vetemxnts,not the first on the circuit just every receptacle you want to change from 2 to 3 prong should be a gfci honestly they are about 15 each you could do it yourself if you have the tools and shut power off you could also hire an electrician and they should not charge you too much 100 tops and that including the gfci time to travel walking in door etc ,2,electricians
vetemxnts,yes with a 3rd wire coming off the splice so that there only one wire under the screw if you are doing it yourself make sure he breaker is off and that it a 15amp breaker ,2,electricians
vetemxnts,looks a bit fishy with the 12 2 and 14 3 but it looks like the 2 blacks on the top screw i would assume are the feed in feed out which is weird for a 3wire and then using the red wire as the leg to the light if you have a pen tester see which is hot and which are not ,1,electricians
vetemxnts,if we are changing outlets from 2 to 3 prong and there is no ground present a gfci must be added to all receptacles that do not have a ground ,5,electricians
vetemxnts,well since you asked here you go and i hope you really look at this because this is major bull my team losing team 2 placement players plat 4 plat 1 winning team onyx 2 diamond 4 plat 1 please tell me how thats fair one kid on my team went 5 20 heres link id love to hear your reply https www halowaypoint com en us games halo 5 guardians xbox one mode arena matches 0a82589e 2cba 4921 a77c 5c4fdd5d33ab players irl 20glitch gamehistorymatchindex 0 gamehistorygamemodefilter all,1,halo
vetemxnts,something needs to be done with placement matches when i am already ranked at plat 6 i expect to play with and against plats and low diamonds i go in slayer solo and get matched with 3 kids all on their first placement game have an in game level of 17 and an overall kda of 2 3 while the other team 2 high diamond and 2 golds what the fuck is this my team got steamrolled placement matches should only play against other placement matches and if theres no placement matches they should go againsts golds or something because this happens to me all the time i keep having players on my team that that should be in the silver leagues please for the love of halo go back to the 1 50 ranking system it weeds out the kids who dont belong ,1,halo
vetemxnts,high 4 did you tune your car too to correct the speedometer i have a 14 v6 debating on 3 55s or 3 73s ,2,Mustang
vetemxnts,are they using a 3 wire for the main ground ,21,electricians
vetemxnts,just from reading what you said pictures probably would not matter as i get the just of it your best bet to be honest is to do a full service change depending on how big your service is 100 200amp if you have a 100amp service i would do a 200amp change over if you already have a 200 amp service i would only do a panel change this way you get a new panel grounds and neutrals will be split spliced have their own landing and you will have new breakers rough estimate probably around us 2 000 depending on your area ,-1,electricians
vetemxnts,depends on what you want to know and how far youre willing to take it before i fully got into the electrical field i took a small class called basic electric at a nearby school was twice a week for 2 hours at night lot of hands on working this is where i learned how to wire switches and plugs 3 ways hang lights also did some light panel work class was not too expensive either ,1,electricians
vetemxnts,i work resi and we use the fiberglass boxes when we do rough ins they are by far the best box i have worked with plastic ones bend too much and look sloppy,2,electricians
vetemxnts,good thing you didnt need to use combo breakers haha,1,electricians
vetemxnts,yeah probably labeled wrong in panel or for that one switch they jumped out power from somewhere near by bedroom maybe i would shut off all 15amp circuits if you do not have a tester or something ,2,electricians
vetemxnts,depends where you are located but my area the cost of living is expensive the blue book price on the car when i bought it in august was 18 5k,1,Mustang
vetemxnts,i bought my 2014 mustang v6 premium used with 32k on it and paid 17k i would have bought you are gt for even 18k ,1,Mustang
vetemxnts,i dont know what im looking at did the red terminal snap on the machine itself its not the best idea but you can splice the wires and wirenut them and tape them off for extra precaution make sure the wires are correct for the plug end,3,electricians
vetemxnts,okay so the new box you cut in only has one 12 2 correct if so you want to do a switch loop if so ill try my best to explain disconnect the micro outlet splice the all old blacks together and then all the old whites together each having their own whip out so you now have 1 black wire and 1 white wire you now have the new 12 2 that we have not touched yet with that new 12 2 take the white and splice it on with the blacks this is going to bring power to the switch now at the switch box put both white and black on the screws power goes down to switch on white and goes back up to outlet on the black now back at the outlet you should have only 1 white wire sticking out from the splice and you should have 1 black wire sticking out from a slice along with the new 12 2 black so you should have 2 blacks and 1 white on the outlet the white wire goes as is on the silver screws dont break the tabs on the the gold screws break the tabs 1 black up top and 1 black on bottom this will create a switch loop and one of the outlets whichever you choose will only come on when the switch it on if thats what youre trying to achieve i hope i explained it so you could follow ,2,electricians
vetemxnts,you need to hire people through word of mouth from other electrician buddies or family and friends i met my current boss because my sister knew someone he trusts me with pretty much everything and i am still an apprentice 4th year i show up on time run a van have a gas card home depot card etc i go to jobs and complete them grab checks on the way out as for moonlighting i openly talk to me boss about side jobs i do and not once did he ever get slightly mad if anything he told me if i ever took a side job and got in a binge that i could call him and he would help me through it etc etc that being said i dont do crazy side jobs my side jobs consist of remove and replace ceiling fan hang new pendent lights add recess cans roof wires add gfci outside etc oh and stop looking on craigslist its full of junkies i know of another local company that hired from craigslist and the employee was stealing for houses ,3,electricians
vetemxnts,i see the bottom of the switch is not protected is the washer bolt coming in contact with hot wires is it grounded properly ,1,electricians
vetemxnts,i know for my boss at least all resi a remodel new construction we charge 15 a sqft adding old work recessed lights in your home 150 per can with labor included add outlet off existing circuit 150 new home run 300 install ceiling fan 200 full service change new meter pvc outside new panel breakers around 2000 depending on what type of breakers are being added straight up panel change 800 ,1,electricians
vetemxnts,i hate them in the panel i just worked on we used the plug on afci gfci combos they extend over the ground bar too rendering them useless i dont know who the hell came up with the panel layout i will try to update with a picture if i go back to the house ,1,electricians
vetemxnts,i have the milwaukee backpack and it has its pros and cons i like it because working in the city sometimes i have to park far away and walk but a majority of my tools barely fit and they are all bunched up overall i like the backpack though ,7,electricians
vetemxnts, what he said you are a hundred times better off leaving the panel betweens the studs rather than surface mounted on drywall i actually do not know if you can even do that in massachusetts the panel is either located in the wall between studs or in basement on a piece of plywood to surface mount you would have to have each wire protected in conduit thats difficult and time consuming or you leave the panel between the studs and just cut out the drywall with your keyhole saw when you need to then patch it after ,1,electricians
vetemxnts,yeah i have seen this with harbor breeze and even the hampton bay brand no ground wire from the fan but you connect the house ground to the bracket so i take it thats how they want it done fan will still work and be safe also ,1,electricians
vetemxnts,how to find which is hot disconnect wires from outlet grab your pen tester and see which one is live and which isnt ,1,electricians
vetemxnts,i am an apprentice also i do side jobs when people come to me for small tasks but i wont go out of my way to look for them but the extra money is nice i normally charge 40 an hour and everyone still thinks thats cheap full 8hour on a saturday i will charge 300 for labor material is extra unless they provide your case depends on certain details are you adding a homerun how far is the distance afci gfci combo since its in garage is it easy to get wire outside are you snaking wires through walls or piping outside etc etc get an idea in your head you know your pace of work and figure out how many hours it will take you then decide your labor rate and you have your answer goodluck,2,electricians
vetemxnts,its new check the sensitivity on it could be a bad photocell could also be a loose connection with the wirenuts ,2,electricians
vetemxnts,yeah that what has me confused because if they are 2 homeruns at the panel then they are not sharing a neutral and having a 2pole serves no benefit i am assuming they run 14 3 with the 2poles and share the neutral ,3,electricians
vetemxnts,cherry blossoms always look so nice along with the gt of course ,2,Mustang

vetemxnts,damn my 2014 v6 averages 21mpg and i am on the highway most of the time lol heavy foot i guess ,1,Mustang
vetemxnts,placement matches are bogus and do not work as they should i see noobs placed in diamond with negative kda and good players in gold with high kda heavily flawed go back to the 1 50 ranking system it kept players where they should be fix solo q if i go in solo i should not match against a party of 3 or 4 the multiplayer maps are pure garbage i do not even need to elaborate on this pregame lobby ugh please let me see who on whose team let me see their ranks not this oh we cant show ranks because people might quit bs it a competitive game basically recreate the halo 2 3 lobby halo 2br was best addition this game has seen blows the h5 br out of the water i am untouchable with it and i do not know why no map voting but add a veto option at least would like to see different game types in slayer again team br team dmr etc etc edit saved too early added a bit more ,1,halo

vetemxnts,been on reddit for a month or so and can t believe i never thought to check out a mustang thread anyways always loved mustangs as a kid but never thought i would actually own one and it never crossed my mind however last year i kept seeing pictures on social media of them and it sparked my love for them once again so i started looking into one last summer june july 2016 and i found one that was beautiful put an offer on it ended up getting it checked out by my mechanic and he said it had tons of problems and the tires had dry rot the owner wouldn t budge on the price either so it broke my heart but i had to let that one go boy am i glad i did i then found this gem a 2014 v6 with the premium package and it was black my preferred car color saw it as a blank canvas to do as a pleased with it i had wanted a v8 as i m sure we all would like but i am absolutely pleased with the 10 14 3 7 motor got it checked out once again by a mechanic and he said this one was good to go so i bought it got a bit of shit for it because it was a v6 but honestly i didn t care one bit i was proud of it i don t have a before picture but it had stock rims with the white mustang strip running down the doors i removed the white strips i like the blacked out look added the quarter window louvers and 20 amr wheels i only got to drive it for about 3 months before i had to let her hibernate for the winter im itching for the spring i plan on tinting the windows installing cai and adding an axle back exhaust asap once it s back on the road what do you think also does anyone have experience with the shelby kicker door sub drop in replacements was also thinking of adding those with an amp because the stock door subs are trash ,4,Mustang
vetemxnts,i actually have not posted in any mustang threads at all but just recently started checking browsing them i just recently bought a 2014 v6 premium august 2016 and i would not change a thing i was looking for a v8 but could not find anything that stood out or met my price range anyways i am 24 did not go to college and i work as an electrician i was lucky enough to qualify for a no money down loan through triple a obviously my monthly payment is a bit higher but if i can make it work you can to definitely try and buy one you wo not regret it i have mine off the road for the winter and it killing me spring cannot come sooner ,1,Mustang
vetemxnts,then they should not be playing ranked in the first place people in onyx and champion arent going to quit when they see ranks of other onyx and champs lol i mean shit back in halo 2 and 3 they showed ranks and i didnt see many people quit at high levels ,1,halo
vetemxnts,that ninja was beautiful,3,halo
vetemxnts,been saying this and tbh i want to see peoples ranks im platinum and if im playing an onyx i want to know before hand so that when i murk them i can give them a proper bagging also placement matches should 95 consist of playing others in placement matches because even half way through a season if i am in high diamond and i lose a game to find out i had a placement player on my team that went 9 i will be bullshit and that happens often ,3,halo
vetemxnts,placement matches need to either be completely removed or heavily modified i played 10 games with a friend we won 6 10 and hes alright but not the best anyways i did better than him my kda was 7 3 and his was like 1 3 or something he got placed plat 3 while i got placed gold 5 makes no sense and bullshit quiet frankly ,2,halo

vetemxnts,heres some more evidence just did my 10 placement games with someone i met in my first match who was also on his first placement so we played the 10 games together my stats kda 7 3 180 kills 99 deaths 71 assists his stats kda 1 4 102 kills 140 deaths 72 assists we won 5 out of 10 shouldve been 6 but one game that we won said retrieving data and it didnt count even on waypoint the game was invisible so i got fucked there moral of the story as you can did i did way better than him capped flags captured most strongholds etc i placed gold fucking 5 he placed platinum 3 i have nothing else to say really ,1,halo
vetemxnts,glad this is happening to you guys too because it happens to me so much it an absolute joke i will land 4 shots they will be absolutely no shield and i will land 3 headshots that wo not register and i dont get the kill theyre 100 on target too ,2,halo
vetemxnts,exactly my point wanna place me in plat fine no problem but dont match me against onyx and high diamonds every match and making me the only platinum thats bullshit ,2,halo
vetemxnts,have not done placement for ffa yet but last season all 10 games i played against high diamond and onyx honestly every game i won 5 ffa out of 10 for placement which i would say is good coming in 2nd or 3rd the rest since i played all onyx and diamond like i said i figured i would place high diamond i ended up playing plat 4 and then it still continued to match me against diamonds and onyx ,1,halo
