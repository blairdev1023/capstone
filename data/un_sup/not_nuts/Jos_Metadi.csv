Jos_Metadi,the link you provided advances several refutation arguments that fail scientifically advances in measuring techniques cannot revise the old data itself only improve new data and if you are trying to claim that we have invented new ways to read the numbers on a mercury thermometer that show half a degree difference that just silly if you claim that new awareness of problems with the location of the old measurements requires making an adjustment to equalize their baseline you must prove both the direction and magnitude of the adjustment using a control group or entirely exclude the problem set from the trend this is where the time of observation bias adjustments fail because we can disprove any significant impact of those stations that changed time of readings by comparing their trends and averages to the stations where no change took place therefore lowering these numbers when producing trends introduces bias instead of removing error and your ad hominem attack on the person who pointed out that nasa has been slowly adjusting historical temperatures down could not be more unscientific science is no respecter of persons if you can demonstrate a logical error or problem in the data it does not matter how many titles a person has received or papers they have published and likewise if you make a mistake or release fraudulent data you are wrong even if you have previously won a nobel prize ,0,Futurology

Jos_Metadi,there were a few down right goofy parts in the book like the dishes but were early in the story in the shire where everything is light hearted and safe my guess would be that you can safely have one silly thing in a scene but more than that and it descends into absurdity in riddles in the dark the silliness comes from gollum split personality even the stuff they added like when smeagol is exclaiming we knows we knows to gollum own riddle still fits in perfectly with it everything else the setup with him murdering the goblin to bilbo danger of wandering lost in the mountain till he died to the threat of him killing and eating bilbo is deadly serious in the throne room and escape you have a silly character a silly song silly physics silly fight choreography and silly sets it too much and the scene falls apart an example of how it could have been done completely seriously would be the tunnel escape from the 13th warrior which created a sense of danger feeling trapped knowing the pursuers are following in force and there may be no way out ,2,movies

Jos_Metadi,imo the biggest problem is its split personality between the some of the silliness of the book vs the seriousness of the world of middle earth as conveyed from the lotr compare the scenes of the dwarves facing and escaping from the great goblin to the scene of bilbo facing and escaping from gollum the first felt ridiculous with no sense of reality or danger to the main characters the second felt captivating with a danger to bilbo life and his soul both had elements of humor but one was silly while the other was exactly what i wanted it to be the second biggest was the attempt to make it follow the standard hollywood formula instead of the book the book had plenty of plot and drama an example of this is inventing a fight scene between dwarves and smaug in the mountain because the good guys have to face off directly with the bad guy in the script re writes of the lotr they managed to move away from the formula back towards the books for example removing the scene where aragorn would have fought sauron at the black gates ,20,movies

Jos_Metadi,generally there are 3 reasons for committing spreading scientific fraud incompetence greed or personal beliefs the first one describes most of the public they accept and promote it because they lack the basic understanding of what science is coming up with a theory testing it disproving it and changing the theory finally coming up with a theory continues to pass tests and can be relied on and so they get fooled by the appearance of science people in lab coats making technical sounding pronouncements with lots of acronyms numbers and charts the second kind sounds like someone accepting blood money but in reality it usually just people who think they will lose their funding job if they do not stay in line with the popular group think they stay silent instead of arguing or even publish work that they have doubts on to make sure they do not bite the hand that feeds them sometimes they even assume their colleagues know something they do not and will look foolish for disagreeing so they agree the emperor new clothes look handsome however their are some who are every bit as greedy as you might imagine these are the politicians who see the fear of climate change as a tool to let them enact crazy taxes and extortion schemes like carbon taxes and credits that go to their budgets or even their personal accounts or get the public to submit to controlling measures they would never accept otherwise the third type is the worst they place their beliefs above science and willfully concoct and spread fraudulent data and conceal real data they are the minority but when they get into positions of authority in control who gets research grants and what papers can get peer reviewed they have a disproportionate influence a couple of years ago some of them got their emails hacked and released they were openly discussing amongst themselves how to hide the decline because the real data would be used to contradict the narrative and confuse the public let people discover that the alarmist global warming is really about a religious belief that humans are bad for the planet ,2,Conservative

Jos_Metadi,if by keep the top businesses in check you mean prevent them from using force threats deception to exclude potential competitors or to make customers buy their goods services then we agree that is the biggest difference between libertarian and anarchist views libertarians know that while large governments create a far less free marketplace a properly sized small government does have a role in maintaining the freedom of individuals to buy what and where they want and to start businesses to compete with other companies that are failing to provide services at reasonable cost as long as trade is free of force threat deception it is always beneficial to both parties another mathematical certainty no matter if they are both individuals or enormous companies the most common problem is that the government not only does nothing to protect individuals rights to buy and compete but actively enables large companies to prevent competition through licensing extensive regulations and targeted laws for examples look at the cases of uber or airbnb where local governments are being lobbied paid by established companies and unions to protect them from competition that provides a better service to consumers ,1,Libertarian
Jos_Metadi,the gap is the distance between the two ends of the bell curve a zero gap is theoretical communism ignoring the inevitable corruption it always creates where the money is distributed identically to all people a large gap is where the poor make a little and the rich make a lot communism sounds good until you realize that time does not stop and people choice tomorrow are influenced by their results today a zero gap means that those who work their butts off to produce value or gain skills to be able to produce better value in the future get no more than those who slacked off so next year they work less hard study less produce less the slackers get more than they would have so are not motivated to work any harder this means the center of that infinitely thin bell curve of peoples incomes moves left and everyone gets poorer this continues in an iterative negative cycle until people start to be unable to survive on that shrunken equal wage this is what we have seen in every country that experimented with communsim socialism the fairer and flatter they tried to make things the worse the results on the flip side you have a totally free market ideal where a person gets to keep the full reward for their effort the hard workers get what they deserve and continue to be motivated to produce much the lazy do not get much and so are motivated to work harder the gap between the two ends of the bell curve gets larger the average goes up and the left poor side goes up back when the us economy was more free and before europe started to move towards at least some free market reforms a poor person in the us was better off than a middle class person in europe ,1,Libertarian

Jos_Metadi,some things to keep in mind on this topic both libertarians and socialists are against corporate corruption but have opposite solutions the socialist answer to everything is more government intervention which in this case increases corruption in both quantity and severity the free market solution of using government only to guarantee competition and freedom of choice actually works as bad as corporate corruption can ever get it not as bad as government corruption in fact the worst historical cases are where the government allowed and enabled the corporate corruption corporations in their current form as separate entities from the people who own run them exist because of government wealth gap is class warfare language that exists to foster envy covetousness not help the poor libertarians know that what really matters is increasing the whole economy because that is what actually increases the standard of living for the poor the smaller the wage gap the worse off the poor are in both mathematical theory and history furthermore corporations as instruments of shared ownership of value producing capital actually enhance the ability of the less wealthy to move away from subsistence living it takes a lot of money to buy a business or fund your own start up but most people can afford to start buying a little bit of stock at a time with the possibility of eventually living off the proceeds ,3,Libertarian

Jos_Metadi,to understand how men view things you have to be able to discern the difference between what people claim they stand for and what they actually do feminists claim to be for equality but their actions paint a very different view of their beliefs here is what feminism really is as defined by the actions of those who wear the label painting all men as evil from the assumption that women never make false accusations to creating a society where any man who works with children is treated as a potential sex offender feminists are unrelenting in promoting fear hatred of men women get all the rights that men get while not having to meet the same standards for example women want the right to fight on the front lines despite not being able to meet the same fitness standards women do not have to bear any of the responsibilities that men have for example they can choose to abort their child but a man cannot choose not be on the hook to pay for it another example is opposing women have to register for the draft they want the right to fight but only if they feel like it rewards based on identify not effort or results example the whole complaint about women getting paid less than men women do not work as many hours in as demanding and dangerous of careers as men but they demand to be paid the same wages just because of who they are limiting men freedom to be away from women feminists fight hard to limit men freedom to have clubs organizations gyms etc with just other guys while promoting women only clubs organizations gyms etc men as whole despise double standards the political policies and social attitudes promoted by feminists are nothing but ,5,MensRights
