runnerag,totally agree with this their first couple encounters were like that actually an animated armor ko would one of them and later a bandit captain was wrecking their shit but i think they have started realizing how to handle battles better as a team the bard in particular is realizing his full potential i like the idea of scaling back if needed to avoid tpks as opposed to trying to artificially inflate difficulty ,1,DnD
runnerag,makes sense thanks ffg ,2,DnD
runnerag,oh jeez i actually did not know that thanks for that info what cr should i shoot for relative to four pcs at level x for just one or two encounters between a long rest i only ask because our weekly sessions are only 2 5 3 hours long due to player availability and they like to draw out non combat scenes for roleplaying social encounters which is fine for me i like improv ing npcs so our typical structure has been to have one bigger battle per session after a good deal of traveling exploration etc i still want to be able to challenge them ,2,DnD
runnerag, 5e inexperienced dm managing encounter difficulty so i am running a home brewed campaign story setting for a group of 4 players and we are having an awesome time so far they have been enjoying my worldbuilding and the amount of open ended plot threads to follow so i feel good about that my issue now is trying to get better at giving them challenging encounters their latest battle was as a group of level 3s tiefling bard gnome rogue elf fighter dragonborn wizard plus an npc knight as per the mm versus an ogre 2 hobgoblin archers two hobgoblin warriors mounted on worgs and an extra worg without a rider that cr2 and 5 cr1 2 i believe i anticipated at least a medium hard battle but they just tore the enemies to shreds i do not think the ogre was even able to damage them the two archers that i placed in difficult to reach spots were dispatched before they even landed a shot and the bard spammed dissonant whispers like a mofo which did a crazy amount of damage and of course my monsters rolled terribly on their saves so it kept triggering aoos so i guess my question is how do you adapt mid battle if you think it needs to be more difficult mid fight i had considered just padding the ogre hp or granting him multi attack but i was not sure if that really kosher to do mid fight idk kinda struggling with the balancing act here any tips going forward ,3,DnD

runnerag,thank you very much for the kind words i think if i had to pick something as my screenwriting voice it would probably be the tight compact actions and incomplete sentences glad to hear it actually effective and yeah i was a bit disappointed in my characters for this i have a hard time building characters in such a small amount of space so i usually try for interesting scenarios and tension for these write offs thanks for the comment i enjoyed your script too ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,very ambitious to divide a short script into full on chapters but i like that you pulled it off with the three wildly different viewpoints kind of an ominous ending too felt a ring of realism to it nice job ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,oooooooooooo cliffhanger i would keep reading this i always get a kick out of your action lines you have very vivid descriptors that feel tarantino esque ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,i liked this it was cool to see the different paths those two revolutionaries took ,2,Screenwriting

runnerag,really dug luis mini monologues i loved the line about wanting to stay in the sun not a huge fan of the consistent use of 4 line actions blocks may want to break those out some but that just be a personal thing interesting read you painted some good characterization ,0,Screenwriting
runnerag,lovely dialogue at the end very poetic it went well with the quote we had to use one critique on yours is to break up dialogue with more action lines and to tighten some of the dialogue as well so it sounds more conversational that usually stuff i do in my scripts on re writes which obviously there not time for in these write offs so great job with what we had enjoyed this one ,1,Screenwriting

runnerag,great twist at the end my only complain is the multiple pages of unbroken dialog which i suppose is a symptom of having the entire sequence happen in one elevator ride would have been nice to break up that up a bit into different locations i did like that you used the trope terms as the character names little bit of fourth wall humor there ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,really cool visuals in this i like the sci fi horror aspect to it dialog is a little contrived and on the nose but that understandable with the time constraint the concept makes me want to keep reading more nice job ,3,Screenwriting

runnerag,you can say are sitting if you want i am just saying that i try to avoid passive verbs frankly i interpret joe and john sit back to back as them already sitting if it the first line of a scene and i expect most people familiar with the craft would as well it up to you though you will hear different answers from different writers ,1,Filmmakers
runnerag,it sort of up to the interpretation of the reader if it was really important that they were already sitting you could say something like joe and john lounge back to back under a tree or if you wanted it the other way that they start the scene by standing and then sit you could say joe and john stand under a tree they turn and sit backs against each other you have to think about what is actually important to a scene and for your characters screenwriting is all about clarity and being concise while keeping the reader eyes moving down the page at the end of the day the director and editor will decide if they start sitting or not do not stress over the reader interpretation unless it important to the scene in some way ,1,Filmmakers
runnerag,the way i learned it and i am self and community taught so take this with a grain of salt you would not have an action in a slug line i would write something like this ext forest clearing day joe and john sit back to back under a tree ,1,Filmmakers
runnerag,to your first set of questions avoid passive verbs if at all possible is are ing your question about hyphens is pretty subjective there no rules about that to your second point you are basically talking about two types if scripts spec scripts or speculative and production scripts specs are usually written by writers trying to sell or find an agent and they are purely story no camera directions or shot instructions production scripts are just that scripts intended for production it sounds like you are both writing and directing so in that case you have got a lot of freedom to do it how you want ,2,Filmmakers

runnerag,huge fan of the podcast thanks for taking time out to do this my question is centered around the idea of shifting into the film industry not just screenwriting though obviously talk to that as you can when you have got a background and existing full time career path that has nothing to do with film in any way i know this is not the path you took but do you have any peers friends that have had steady work in film that did transition from a totally different profession if so what piece of advice could you give for anyone considering the same ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,tough to answer i am not sure if i should include the time i had to quit on a due to injury and limp back to my car or when i was pacing someone 100 miler and they could barely hike back or when i was jogging with a family member during their very first 5k or all the times i was on a trail with intense vertical climbs etc i guess the slowest mile where i was actively pushing and there was no walking stopping was probably 12 00 or so ,1,running
runnerag,congrats man i was out volunteering last weekend at the rocky raccoon 100 miler both great events ,2,running
runnerag,goal grasslands trail marathon late march only my second marathon and my first trail full so my goal is mostly just a finish monday recovering from pacing a friend 100 miler last weekend tuesday 9 miles gentle hills sub 8 00 avg great run for me with lots of speedy bursts wednesday missed a run due to extracurricular activities somewhat ashamed of that thursday 8 miles mid 8 00 average in some north texas snow friday rest saturday 18 mile trail run fairly flat but rocky and root infested kept an overall low 10 00 average til i bonked in the last 5k or so this one tore up my legs sunday 9 miles easy pace kept it steady never walked but definitely did not push anything overall 44 mile week in the meat of my marathon training and that with a skipped recovery run day feel pretty good overall but i need to work on my recovery and my trail nutrition ,3,running
runnerag,i like to always try and have a goal race scheduled so i am in some level of soreness most days i would only ever call it pain if it the morning after a hard run a high mileage week or right after a race if i am in legitimate pain and it not one of those reasons then i take that as a sign that i need to cut back a little ,2,running
runnerag,not a major accomplishment but i had a 42 mile week and it barely even felt like i had to push for that number i maxed out around 44 miles in a week just last year for my first marathon training cycle and it was torture at the time so it good to feel my endurance increasing 2014 is shaping up to be a great year for my running maturation ,4,running
runnerag,have not posted on one of these in a couple weeks hopefully that qualifies me as a lurker went on a date two thursdays ago dinner at a local pizzeria in a part of town she would never been in went well she a runner like me which gave us an instant conversation starter second date was last sunday which actually was a running date followed by brunch but she had to leave early for work pretty sure she was late but okay with it which made me feel good but guilty date 3 this past tuesday where she actually met several of my co workers for a weekly pub trivia thing i do with my project team i was kinda anxious about someone meeting friends of mine on only a third date but she had a blast and we stayed after they left to talk and close down the place her roommate was also there on a date and i got an early approval from her which made me happy i snuck in some cutesy stuff on the way back hand holding gave her my jacket quick make outs in my truck decided to make her dinner this past friday night busted out a new recipe in my tiny apartment kitchen i thought it sucked but whether she agreed or not she told me multiple times how much she loved it so i went with it we basically netflixed rounded second base and talked until the wee hours of the morning we both were really feeling into taking it further but decided to hold off i had a 16 mile training run to wake up for so she did not stay over though i still suffered through my run on 3 hours of sleep and a bunch of beer still in my system not recommended i think i really see something here but i have self destructed in the past by going headfirst into a relationship before the girl is ready or to be honest before i should be ready trying to moderate my level of eagerness i guess but this is still a promising start ,3,OkCupid

runnerag,interesting topic the ability to enjoy a moment of silence together is crucial i think how did tarantino put it that how you know you have found someone special when you can just shut the fuck up for a moment and enjoy a comfortable silence apart from that not worrying about little things regarding lines of communication ie stressing about getting texts back if you are sending too many etc finding yourselves laughing a lot during normal conversation oh and not stressing about things like the first kiss my last successful string of dates we did not kiss until date 3 and it was early in the evening when other people we knew were around we were waiting at the bar we hugged and both went in that kind of first kiss was a first for me but i loved how easy and natural it felt so yeah there some male perspective ,4,OkCupid

runnerag,probably my most recent one she came over this past christmas eve this was after a very long date the previous night and her leaving my place 8 hours earlier helped me wrap presents we got in comfy clothes reigned in christmas day with snacks couch snuggles and netflix and spent the night together i had never been with anyone on christmas morning apart from with family as a kid and i was completely smitten unfortunately our next planned dates were cancelled while i was out of town for the rest of christmas and i have not talked to her since womp womp but that night is a good memory at least ,1,OkCupid

runnerag,i can sense the sarcasm p do not get me wrong it still sucks but it better than it could have been,3,OkCupid
runnerag,i guess it was in context to the extent that she started with i am a late bloomer but even that was not at all what we had been talking about but like i said it came across as kind of a nerve induced thing which i thought was cute but i am also not icked out by that or anything some guys may be ,1,OkCupid
runnerag,i have yet to have mine it a little embarrassing to admit so that like a 5th date thing x,10,OkCupid
runnerag,ftr as op i agree with this last thing i would want to do as a rejectee is make the girl feel like she needs to fade in the future ,5,OkCupid
runnerag,that a good point and i am not sure how i would react tbh i think it requires a level of maturity from both sides though even if it was a reason that i thought was ridiculous it valid to her and there zero to be gained from arguing why her opinion is stupid ,13,OkCupid

runnerag,i have only seen nebraska and 12 years a slave from that list although dallas buyers club is next on my list i am hearing people call matthew mccaunaghey the lead for best actor because of this movie nebraska was a heartwarming and pleasant film very much a snapshot of the american midwest which as a canadian not sure if you will identify with 12 years a slave is a rare must see imo fantastic if not brutal movie cannot comment on the rest ,1,OkCupid
runnerag,i have got my first full marathon on sunday been training the last 18 weeks using hal higdon intermediate plan and feeling ready but nervous as hell ,2,OkCupid

runnerag,i cannot speak for the commenter but in my second draft of my current feature 90 of my first act has changed about half of my second act will be different or at least reorganized and the third act will be sharpened and tweaked writing is rewriting you will be tempted in your first draft to start reorganizing and rewriting as you go especially in the slog that is the third quarter of your script but i am personally a big proponent of getting through that draft from start to finish accepting that it may suck and typing fade out before making major changes ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,ten pages in four hours is moderately fast ten good pages in four hours is remarkably and inexplicably fast at least for me my first draft of my first feature length spec including treatment character profiles and scene planning took a few months that with a non writing full time job rewriting it now and it a long process ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,oh my that looks truly and gloriously disgusting ,2,shittyfoodporn

runnerag,i have had something similar ever since over training for my first half marathon i am into the high mileages weeks of my first marathon training cycle right now and any walking i do in the 24 36 hours following my long runs is hellish on my hip flexor as soon as i start anything from a recovery jog to a bit of speedwork it all feels fine ,1,running
runnerag,only thing that really stands out is that i would prefer to see your third pic as the profile thumbnail you have got a great smile in that one if you were in my area i would probably message you you have got a wealth of info and interesting ice breaker things in your profile ,2,OkCupid

runnerag,ah ok i have some subjective critiques regarding the film as a whole i do not think the cell shaded toon thing really added much but since this is a screenwriting sub my main critique is the pub scene two people at a table talking nahhhhhhh the conversation was not bad but a more creative way to get the dialog out would have pumped up those scenes a ton awesome story as a whole though good showcase of what you can do with dirt cheap tools if the concept and execution are solid ,2,Screenwriting

runnerag,computer science at a traditional 4 year conservative engineering oriented school usually when i tell people that especially when they know i like to write it surprises them but i have always found a certain art in software architecture and development the two domains of writing and software engineering overlap in some ways plus they both require long hours and do not get much recognition ,4,Screenwriting
runnerag,i need to do a write off been a while since i have worked on anything except my current spec almost done maybe tomorrow afternoon ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,soon ,3,dogpictures
runnerag,mmk i want to expand my question now that that cleared up how exactly are these lines set i know it not just football analysts in vegas picking based on stat comparisons i have always been told it more about what will drive people to bet more but lose more but how is that figured out ,1,CFB
runnerag,so what happens if the spread is 3 and the score is 24 21 who covers in that case ,2,CFB
runnerag,this might be trending towards too non football related but how does betting on a spread work i have taken it to be that if team a is minus 10 5 vs team b the line is set at team a winning by a 10 5 margin so you can take team a to cover which means they win by 10 5 or more or take team b to cover so that they either lose by less than 10 5 or win but what does taking a team straight up mean or when people say give me the points on team a there so many terms that are confusing to me ,3,CFB
runnerag,i am starting to see why some are so down on this subreddit no reason this should be getting this many downvotes this is good advice if nothing else op should probably try this suggestion it may work for him it may not but it a proven methodology ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,no idea why you are getting downvoted this is a completely reasonable thing to say ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,a screenplay no a treatment or outline absolutely that happens but that why it good to do beat sheets character profiles and other pre writing exercises ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,these graphs and diagrams always confuse me this is trying to over complicate something that should be second nature to storytellers it just a basic arc if you need to be told that a protagonist should want something try to get it and change as a result then you might be in the wrong field ,2,Screenwriting

runnerag,very cool keep us updated i am curious how it goes on that ultra low budget are you being kept on in any capacity during production ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,i am reading this right after knocking out a couple pages at my local starbucks i love writing in public i think all the different people around help make me feel more creative and impassioned being at home is too sterile an environment if you are worried about people seeing what you are doing and judging you for it then you may not have the balls for writing ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,op did not tell us what his goals are at all with this script so given that lack of information i really do think the only real advice we can give is to keep writing ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,write another one ,7,Screenwriting
runnerag,mostly experience and a solid number of drafts under my belt i have only been seriously working on screenwriting for a few months and have got one almost done spec script that will need re writes i am pretty confident in my abilities so far and have managed to write every day with a 45 50 hour a week job and other hobbies so i agree with those who say that i do not have time is a shitty excuse i just need to write more before i decide to make more serious moves ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,i already own a pair of their trail n1s so this did not sway me any particular direction but if i had not this might push me further away from choosing pi surprised that this made it past the pi higher ups ,1,running
runnerag,so do you recommend ever revisiting the first draft of the first script it would likely be an interesting challenge to rewrite what may have been a solid idea but was marred by inexperience ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,fair enough my question was more geared towards the idea that since it a learning tool you might as well use that tool to teach yourself how to approach re writing as well as initial drafting since they seem to offer distinct challenges the end result will be the bottom drawer but the more experience you can squeeze out of one script the better ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,thank you for this thread and for all the people with great replies i have a question related to this i am in somewhat of a different position than a lot of the fresh out of school people as i got a degree and subsequent job in a completely non film related industry computer science it software consulting and am working through paying off student loan debts now i am currently screenwriting on top of working 45 50 hours or so a week to work on that craft devoting a minimum of a half hour every day usually an hour or more and sometimes much more on weekends only missed a few days of writing in the past few months i really really love it so far and i feel terrible when i get to the end of long days and have not been able to get a page written yet my current job is a lot more stable than a screenwriting job would be and it pays pretty well given my age going on 24 so at minimum i want to erase my student loan debt while i continue to write every day but at the end of the day i just do not know if i want it to be my life career so my question is if there anyone else on here who was set in a completely unrelated field and broke themselves away from it to get into screenwriting and move to la it almost seems scarier from my position because there a lot to lose compared to a fresh film school graduate any thoughts or anecdotes ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,i always hear this reply but do you think there any value in doing re writes on that first script making it as good as you can and then stashing it in the drawer ,7,Screenwriting
runnerag,one of my favorite dialogue scenes in any movie ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,never read adventures skimmed save the cat at a bookstore since that seemed to be the popular one for newbies but was turned off by how over formulaic it was and put it back on the shelf working through story right now really enjoying it not sure how much practical stuff will come out of it for me but it still an engaging read picked up screenplay because i love screenwriter workbook but have not read it yet never read mailroom ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,as another amateur writer about 80 pages into my first feature i feel like it can be easy to get too caught up in all the mechanics of beat sheets and over formulaic outlines in looking for a book to help get me started i skimmed save the cat but was instantly turned off by them actually giving specific page numbers for all these different beats instead i turned to syd field stuff screenwriter workshop in particular which preached the idea of a simple 4 page treatment with the major act breaks and a solid intro outro some index cards here and there to help with sequencing and a rough 3 act diagram have been more than enough to get me through my first draft all first scripts are bottom of the drawer material anyway so do not get too hung up on formulas ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,i would be really surprised if nyc did not have a free consistent writer group i found one in dallas easily ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,pick up the screenwriter workbook by syd field it basically the class that he offers offered in book form it has clear instructions and examples on building a 3 act screenplay to help learn structure i know there are a lot of opinions on the best way to do pre writing if at all when to re write how to form your story etc but this is a great easy to follow read that will help build a first draft and subsequent re writes from there you can branch off into different techniques if you want ,5,Screenwriting

runnerag,i have been doing a write every day thing for a little over a month one thing that helped me keep some sort of structure was listing out requirements for a complete deliverable and using that as a minimum one or more pages of a first draft one or more re written pages one or more character profiles one or more story building units page of a treatment notecards etc for the last 35 days every day has been one of those four for one particular project but i prefer working on one project at a time especially if it a feature ,1,Screenwriting

runnerag,as someone who never went to film school or anything tangentially related to film school i have enjoyed reading a lot of books that do not necessarily teach screenwriting but provide a sense of context for things such as how to build a narrative regardless of medium the history of film breakdowns of critically acclaimed screenplays essential formatting what to knows stuff like that not sure that answers your question or not ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,hm ok have not thought about that thanks for the input ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,i use this http www writersstore com dont break the chain jerry seinfeld works beautifully for me,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,lolwut good turnout is what you should be focusing on not lack of upvotes i think they are going great and provide a fun way to keep writing ,5,Screenwriting
runnerag,this is my answer too for all the same reasons even more than the movie was the incredible behind the scenes documentaries there was so much passion and dedication from every department that it makes me want to do nothing with my life except make incredible films ,2,Filmmakers
runnerag,follow up question regarding the language thing i have got a script with several characters who speak a language that none of my main characters understand and that i do not want the viewer to understand either for story reasons and so that the foreign characters body language is more critically analyzed by the viewer should i even bother using dialog formatting when they speak or should it just be incorporated into the action lines ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,thanks for the thoughtful reply the idea of one voice being the real key is one i can get behind i am starting to see traces of my own voice after a handful of short scripts and a big chunk of my first feature spec which makes me excited to write more ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag, obviously you need to master all of the basics which are pretty much the same across all genres plot structuring character development conflict etc oh i understand i am devouring the recommended books writing every day constantly evaluating my narrative structure and characters all that stuff horror is actually the one thing i really have no interest in writing so i know if i try it will come out shitty not even gonna bother so far i prefer doing action and drama so my main focus is on projects in those arenas but i also have some dark comedy ideas that i think i will try out luckily i am in no hurry to sell anything right now want to get some drafts re writes and stick it in the drawer scripts under my belt first ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,gotcha fwiw i am not by any means relying on writing for my income right now i work in a completely unrelated field and make a decent living at that and for now i am writing on the side but i have aspirations of shifting into film at some point as a career if i end up enjoying it and having a knack for it the artistic argument is fine and dandy but i am looking for the best ways to become marketable at an early stage in my development as a writer your posts have helped a lot with that so thank you ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,not sure why you got downvotes for this i like this answer thanks for the detailed reply ,5,Screenwriting
runnerag,i am of the opinion that cliches and predictability are not inherently bad in screenplays even ready to sell scripts if you have good characters and good conflict it all good ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,i have left individual comments for each user but overall i think i would pick u circusbrendan the dialog and theme he was using felt very real to me good job everyone ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,honestly this was kinda boring when i got to the end i still could not really distinguish the two characters from their dialog not much happened a scene full of just dialog can be interesting but this did not really do much for me felt like a second act scene that i would need a lot of context for ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,i definitely read this as a one night stand kinda thing made me feel really bad for andrea solid script overall some clunky dialog but not much else to comment on ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,i really liked the conversation could be sharpened up on re writers but you captured the general feeling of watching an old person and a young child talk to each other slightly predictable ending but it was well executed good job ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,haha fun little short you captured that stevedore characterization well not sure sure i really saw any evidence of the article being used though ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,lot of complexity in this one i admire what you were trying to do but it may have been too much a couple of the scenes just felt random compared to everything else and the ending was odd i know the it a long story line is poetic in a way but it did not really resolve any sort of conflict that was there or tell us much plus nobody would really say that in that situation imo some beautiful writing in the action lines though ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,that was a fun one to visualize you used transitions and voice over more effectively than any other script i have seen in these write offs the article reference seemed a little like a throw away though good characters ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,lol maybe i made it too subtle the whole scene is kind of a sarcastic overly literal look at the article the fate of the victim at the end was due to technology instead of a manual error which the doctor was trying to do based on that newspaper article early in the scene hope that helps ,2,Screenwriting

runnerag,you know what i am starting to like you ,0,Screenwriting
runnerag,and as before i agree with everything you said i think you are underestimating writers none of us are intentionally writing less than our best effort it would be asinine to spend time doing that ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,from the sound of the op he has not written a screenplay yet and wo not know if it shit until it written i see you comment on this notion a lot and i think most of us agree that writing something that wo not be salvageable is turrible but if he cannot even get a single page written after months of trying at some point he just needs to start typing writing and learn there nothing to be scared of ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,lol i really need to quit committing to these so early my mid week schedule is always too hectic hopefully we keep having at least one on weekends this one seemed pretty insane with all the requirements though i am curious to read them after scanning hoobsher scores ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,this is a better time for me than the last couple may well be in this one ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,did not have time to take part in this one last night but i have been reading them throughout the morning and there were some good entries my thoughts u comedyweekly16 the time pressure showed here with the awkward dialog and action but the concept of the narrator mocking cory was actually really funny to me i would watch a more fleshed out episode in this style if you were given time to tighten it up u flowerofhighrank pretty solid not a lot of specific comments felt very intro y overall did not get the sense of much of an arc for either character but i would probably read a few more pages if this was part of something bigger u drunklogicist hmm interesting piece the doctor was a cool character i like how he clearly a sleazy guy despite being in the medical field the only thing i had trouble with was more of a logic thing i ve moved you up to the top of the list that would never ever happen for a transplant situation so it takes away from the believability of the scene quite a bit other than that fun read u talkingbook the best one of yours i have seen so far fantastic story idea a little too tight but given the write off requirements i think you did a good job squeezing all of those beats into a 5 minute film u sleepingjoey great script no real complaints surprised to see that sort of emotional depth in such a short time you have got a knack for drama the only thing i might say is the doctor spoke a little too much in his explanation of what happened might be more impacting to keep his words few something like the donor had rabies we caught it too late i am sorry despite that one thing fantastic execution of a good dramatic premise u archonemis i am digging the minimalist style of your narrative i think it works for this format there a lot of blanks for the reader to fill in for themselves which probably would be a pain in the ass if this was going into production but it makes reading the script a fun experience vote would probably go to u sleepingjoey just because it was the most complete narrative with the most dramatic impact great job everyone ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,awesome sounds like a dream come true keep us updated ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,that great news congrats are you going to be involved at all in production or allowed on set in any capacity ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,i mayyy be in for this one i got a few solid pages in on my spec just now and i will have gotten my other evening things out of the way by then i will report back ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag, if i take the time to really imagine my scene and see it in my brain and feel it feelings and so forth and then make the effort to really try to convey what it is i see suddenly i have got something worthwhile i am really experiencing my film and it not a lie anymore i am simply describing an experience that felt as real to me as anything else i know that peter jackson used this technique heavily throughout the pre production and filming of lotr and it created a sense of realism that probably would not have been there otherwise it good advice no matter how fantastical something is that we are creating as writers we really need to believe in the characters the drama and the premise i like how you have worded this ,1,Screenwriting

runnerag,i am in that boat i have written a few short scripts but am currently working on the first draft of my first feature length screenplay i have that feeling on every single page i just have to keep telling myself that i am confident in my dramatic premise i am satisfied with the depth of my character bios i am happy with the general story beats i have laid out i am and just need to plow through that initial draft it gonna suck the dialog will be phony the characters will seem like different people occasionally the pacing will be wonky as hell but that all for the re write unless you lose faith completely in your basic premise i say just keep writing i would feel more worried if i was happy with everything in my first draft it would mean i am hopelessly delusional and doomed to not get better gotta get that story on the page ,1,Screenwriting

runnerag,thanks for reading all the way through mine despite the score i definitely understand what you are saying about the action scenes being slowed by unnecessary stuff this was my first legitimate action scene to write in script form so i was not sure how bare bones it needed to be i tend to be over descriptive in prose so that transferred over i will keep that in mind thanks again ,3,Screenwriting

runnerag,haha understandable i envisioned that shot in my head but was sort of vague on the action line it was more like he was leaning over the egde to take out lin and then just took a step back to where lin could not simply fire straight up and pop him it was not like a backflip or anything haha ,2,Screenwriting

runnerag,thanks for the feedback i was slightly aware of the exposition y intro as i wrote it but i was hoping to get my draft finished in time and was not able to give it a good re write before submitting i will try to be wary of that in the future and yeah the twist is sort of born out of the idea that he does not want to kill women but has no problem with non lethal torture i could see how it came off as artificial though ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,i want to start by saying it was hilarious watching us all fumble with the required word i have no idea if any of us even got the usage right haha u hoobsher i liked the chaotic storytelling of yours it would have been a great intro scene for a feature length script i would keep reading more if it the first few pages of a full spec u comedyweekly16 great characters funny dialog a bit of a cheeky ending but it was amusing u deflective felt like i wanted a lot more maybe at least up to the initial conversation between david and the intruder cool setting though u stuckinthroat1 hahahaha oh man bonus points for your use of the word u talkingbook liked the vibe i could see it being a sort of dark romantic comedy i have been having fun reading your dialog in all these contests you have got a knack for that sort of quick back and forth style my vote would probably go to u hoobsher with u talkingbook as a close second ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,this was my first one of these to actually be a part of it was pretty exhilarating i am usually too much of a perfectionist with my writing i think these will help me focus more on the narrative and the characters on first drafts about to read the other entries ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,hah ok fair enough i was mostly just frustrated for a minute with this because i had been struck with a really good scene to write for the first article and had an outline going when we changed articles i was not aware we were gonna be able to vote to change stuff now i know for future contests ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,i will just agree to disagree i am fine with it if it levels the playing field for all entrants it not like the research gives one of us a clear advantage ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,still disagree completely with the first two that article and a couple wikipedia links gave me enough for a quick 5 minute scene outline if we go by voting for these then ok cannot argue with that i prefer we not in the future though ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,ack sorry wrong link here it is http www scribd com doc 155158165 potential,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,what is the official end time for this we got started at an odd time,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,can we agree not to change anything next time though the difficulty should be part of the competition there were plenty of dramatic contexts to be gleaned from the first article ,2,Screenwriting

runnerag, i am concerned a cartoony animation could detract from its serious tone it sounds like you answered your own question is there a particular reason it would need to be cartoony if you are set on video you could always do a preface i have no idea if this is a term or not spec trailer with some readings and rough cutting to get the general idea down if it were me i would offer this in addition to a good logline and short treatment not in place of them ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,go to half price books and pick up the screenwriter workbook by syd field follow that read scripts and watch movies also write a lot ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,my vote goes to talkingbook this looks like it was a tough topic to do these are all from one of two viewpoints it seems but tb stood out because clair was just a straight up interesting character insidiousvendetta was a close second for similar reasons regarding james only one i did not really finish was kaliski not to sound harsh but the grammar spelling mistakes just distracted me too much as did the confusion of kim apparently not being kim kardashian but a dude in kanye posse i kept wondering if you were using the wrong gender pronoun which threw me off of actually taking in your narrative ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,i keep missing these looks like there a good deal more competitors than before i will get to reading in a bit and report back ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,welp having no knowledge of this prior 5 minutes ago i now would pay money to see it i would call that a successful trailer ,3,Filmmakers
runnerag,no problem i am still a newbie so take what i said with a hefty grain of salt there were a lot of good things to take away from the script that i will keep in mind for my writing especially the flowing dialog it read great ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,i am gonna disagree with the other reviewer about the opening being full of throw away dialog the bit of banter at the beginning painted an instant picture of the relationship ellis and katherine have which formed a good foundation for most of the rest of the script plus the dialog was fun to read i only got pulled out of the back and forth a little by some grammar issues i did have a couple other issues though 1 i know this is probably just a different creative take on the story you wanted to tell but i really wanted something between these scenes meeting asia through ellis description getting the i love you and then the response and subsequent change in mood of ellis all seemed very rushed which may have been your goal but it leads to my next complaint 2 katherine decision to kiss ellis came out of nowhere to me and completely went against everything she would been built up to be i get that she supposed to have an arc of her cynical defenses kinda crumbling but the authenticity of her character also crumbled when it only took half a day for it to happen tl dr you built up the two leads fantastically but the ending felt rushed and out of nowhere i did make it through really quickly though largely because of the good dialog ,0,Screenwriting
runnerag,fun scripts guys sorry i missed it i was working last night on my main spec project tb your dialog has been fun to read in all of these write offs just like with the spotify script i wanted to keep going in this one and see the two characters develop i do think there was maybe a little too much dialog but it was interesting to read and felt mostly authentic pizzaguy yours was really creative i was laughing out loud at the montage scene partly because i was imagining this music http www youtube com watch v pko350y4glu playing with behind it arrested development style you had me rooting for franz by the end he seems like a good guy based on your pages nice job guys ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,it impressive to see these drastically different takes in only an hour of work i gotta say tb yours drew me in the most the gun did it for me as soon masi brought it into view there was an amped up tension i am still uneasy with his future at the end and wanted to read more you packed a ton of interesting characterization into those pages ,2,Screenwriting
runnerag,if this becomes a regular thing could it be on weekends or evenings i and i am sure many others have a day job during normal working hours this sounds fun though ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,that real living thanks for sharing ,2,running
runnerag,the answer to all of your questions is unfortunately it depends a good rule to go by if you are going to be running regularly is just always be drinking water in the summer especially pre hydrating is almost more important than hydrating during runs and of course always re hydrate afterwards until you need to pee and it a nice light lemonade color i do agree with most everyone else in that your body should not really need water during a 5k if you felt that you did you probably were not taking care of your water intake in the hours leading up to the race or you were did not train for that speed in the heat very well as to the runner high thing i find it funny that anyone is trying to attach a distance to it there are soooo many variables that go into the classic second wind of a training run or race i have had it happen on a 4 mile run in the middle of a long trail run at the end of a half marathon etc and it not a consistent thing i would not worry about when to expect it just appreciate it when it comes your legs will adjust the more you train make sure you throw in a recovery day here and there and drink a lot of water after runs to flush out the lactic acid ,1,running
runnerag,this is genius i need to know more about this invincible dick warrior ,4,Screenwriting

runnerag,why do these types of threads always turn into a pissing match people improve in their writing in different ways for some it helps to always be writing even if 90 of the stuff is thrown away for some it does not help what else needs to be said ,3,Screenwriting
runnerag,i am still new to screenwriting but just from reading books and watching film tv and knowing what i like it always far more interesting for a character to learn by experience and maturation than it is for them to be taught something a lesson comes off far more like the latter whereas overcoming a challenge tends to result in the former jmo ,3,Screenwriting

runnerag,the actual coming up with is the easy part for me they just kinda pop in during random situations could be while working during a meeting out running while falling asleep at a ball game there no rhyme or reason but i am somewhat scatter brained and those little idea nuggets tend to leave my head quickly so i will write down a sentence or two immediately if something that seems interesting pops in sometimes those idea nuggets seem absolutely bizarre when reading over them weeks later but a handful can be expanded into a real story with legitimate beats it sort of a numbers game ,1,Screenwriting
runnerag,i am in exactly the same boat as you 8 5 job doing stuff i enjoy ok but not feeling really fulfilled and not at all film related curious to see the responses ,2,Filmmakers

runnerag,you clearly feel very strongly about this which is exciting to see do you have any other tips or book recommendations what is your answer to the idea of writer block or do you deny that it exists at all for good writers i like the idea of always striving for perfection in anything you write but it likely inevitable really that sometimes crap will come out what are your thoughts on that these are honest questions from a newbie to screenwriting i am genuinely not trying to downplay what you are saying ,1,Screenwriting
