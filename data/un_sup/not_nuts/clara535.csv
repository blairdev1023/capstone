clara535,mine would follow me from room to room sitting near me but facing away from me just wanted to tell you i am not speaking to you ,1,aww
clara535,same here i am pretty sure this baby gives zero fucks about what we dress it in we will just have to buy stuff that ok for a boy or a girl you mean everything is the baby going to explode if you put it in a onesie made for the opposite gender will the police take it away then what is the problem makes me crazy ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,thank you so much i tend to agree with you i am just having more issues than normal communicating and it frustrates me that i cannot articulate my concerns most of the time and when i can they are not addressed ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,lol ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,i just googled can i take fleet suppositories while pregnant except all i had to type in was can i take fleet and the rest was the first suggestion while this sucks i guess i am not alone ,4,BabyBumps
clara535,bowling ball boobs are not fun and thank goodness my nipple are not itchy but they are dry and flaky ouch ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,that all stuff i would say i am so sorry that super annoying i cannot believe she texting you i would find health articles relating to women her age and text those to her and ask if she doing the things the article says i mean obviously i probably would not but i would like to the worst thing mine has done was tell me i should not be around cats she thinks all animals and the outside are dangerous and gross and full of disease whatever i do what i want ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,you are smart i am using this thanks ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,that so nice of you while i agree with everyone that she was being childish and out of line it probably best for you to do this either it will smooth everything out or if she continues to act hurtful you know to avoid her at least you will have somewhat of a resolution ,15,BabyBumps
clara535,that sounds amazing happy birthday ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,geez i would lose my temper and make some charts on what i ate and when i ate it and next time they made a comment i would stop them and give it to them and say if they have any more questions or they need more detail i would be glad to help and thank them for the service they are providing me or something i mean this is the actual reason i am not working so never listen to me but ugh so infuriating ,6,BabyBumps
clara535,warning i rant for a couple paragraphs oh my god this has always made me rage i do not really care about eating in front of people but holy crap people commenting snidely on when and how much anyone eats is just so so so so rude and unnecessary and invasive were you raised by goats why do you give a fuck about my food intake are you still eating yeah me and the baby are still alive so i gotta keep doing it it bananas not to mention our whole lives are spent in a fishbowl re our weight it just enrages me when people keep re enforcing the idea that it ever ok to make casual comments on shit like that if we are good friends you can ask for advice or a cautionary tale or whatever but otherwise just fucking stop leave me alone let me eat sorry to get so worked up no one has done that to me except people i barely know and i gave zero fucks but i hate that it happens at all i cannot imagine anyone i spend time with doing that to me and i have been really patient with the annoying crap people have done but if this in particular happens i probably will lose my shit i admire you ladies who control your tempers ,7,BabyBumps
clara535,it not just you some days i can wear one liner all day and some days i end up changing my underwear several times the scent concentration and tolerability sorry varies from day to day the liners i am using are these insanely thin ones that fit even in my smaller panties i bought a box of like 100 or something a year ago and just now ran out they do not seem to have the odor issue that other liners do and because they are so teeny i do not feel like i am wearing a pad i know it can be an unpopular idea but we also use wipes i really do not like making more garbage than i have to but i also cannot take 4 showers a day or use tampons and there are only so many options available they have really really saved me from feeling gross and self conscious all the time ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,oh yikes i thought i would get out of this one by having a 600 sq foot house because it would obviously be ridiculously uncomfortable and imposing for a fourth person to try and occupy such a small space nope oh i will come and stay with you so you can get some sleep dude no you wo not it not that i do not appreciate the thought or help but you cannot help us establish a daily routine because you wo not be living here this house is too small for anyone to do anything without everyone else hearing or seeing it i could not deal with that kind of stress before i was pregnant i will not be able to handle it with a newborn ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,first i want to say they are not entitled to it and acting like they are does not make it so this particular issue has been more of a pain than anything else so far and i am only 14 3 i honestly do not know what i am going to do yet my in laws rescheduled their month long trip to europe so they can be there for the birth i know when my sil had all of her kids both sets of parents the siblings and other family came to the hospital the same day her babies were born to meet hold the new one etc that frankly sounds like an insane nightmare and i am not sure they will be happy about my plan to not have anyone visit in the hospital i am open to the idea depending on how we feel but like someone else said my goal and ultimate responsibility is to bond with my baby and figure out how to keep it alive not make sure they get what they want and yeah everyone seems thinks the rules you make apply to everyone but them as for dealing with it i have mentioned that we do not know when we will be able to have visitors as a nice way of saying you do not get to do whatever you want whenever it was met with oh no we will be there to see our grandchild welp looks like you are not getting a call until we are at home really you do not owe anyone anything try not to let them pressure you into pretending otherwise i just made sure from 6ish weeks on that so has my back and will enforce whatever socializing rules i need by whatever means necessary he a saint and a god for doing this and it has made this pregnancy actually pretty nice rather than a stressful tense anxiety fueled nightmare ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,omg that a fantastic idea thank you so much i am definitely putting this into action ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,oh man i said smash hands instead of high five which was amusing last week at my dr appt i cried while checking in because i had refried beans on my face i was checking out and the woman asked my name and probably birth date or address i do not remember which and i did not remember what they were when she asked she asked me a couple questions and i had to have her repeat herself several times she scheduled my next appointment and asked if i wanted a printout and i said that would be awesome because i still was not hearing anything she said bless her heart she was so nice about it then i walked down the hall took the elevator downstairs walked down another hall and decided to stand in the starbucks line where the checkout woman approached me with my keys i would left on the counter i ended up not getting starbucks because some people formed a second line and it was too much there are more examples but that was a particularly derpy afternoon ,5,BabyBumps
clara535,oh man i am glad i peed right before reading all these yours in particular made me lol ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,this woman is being deliberately and openly cruel spiteful and vindictive and it disgusting you are not being overly sensitive or hormonal i am sorry but there is no chance she does not realize it either she straight up abusing you you do not deserve it the reasons why do not matter one bit you are not obligated to even explain to her why you are cutting her out she knows damn well and repeating myself for emphasis you do not deserve this ,9,BabyBumps
clara535,this i did not get anything but i also did not want or expect it and i am pretty sure it would never have occurred to him if he was being thoughtless i would be upset but i would just explain to him that this is a thing people do and he would understand ,4,BabyBumps
clara535,aw i am so sorry i understand 9 weeks was so bad for me too happy mother day anyway hope the rest of it was alrightish ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,during week 12 i was the most tired i have been so far 14 1 now to be totally fair i think a great deal of that was depression but i mostly just slept all week i am better now though a couple days ago after dropping my so off at work at 9 am or so i had two bowls of cereal and went back to sleep and woke up at five pm i did not even think that was possible it not like i would worn myself out sleeping all night it sounds like a lot of people have gone through similar fatigue symptoms but if it still bothering you after a couple more days i think it would be a good idea to call your doctor he she may have some idea of what is going on with you specifically and could have an idea of what might help ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,i am ok sorry about that did not mean to implode on reddit ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,i honestly did not meant to imply that anyone who has an unplanned pregnancy is irresponsible or should be upset i am really sorry if i came across that way i am upset about them doing just that because they know damn well i was trying for a while they know for a fact this was planned but they keep talking about mistakes to throw in my face repeatedly that they think i am being irresponsible and and should be more contrite about it i guess i am not asking them for shit they can whatever i have not been able to stop crying for two days i should probably talk to someone about this ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,it not totally the same but the implication that this pregnancy was accident feels really insulting to me mainly because it my parents and in laws doing it because my partner and i are not married yet and for my part because i did not quite turn out like my parents wanted they tend to act like i owe 10 more years of penance or something for all my mistakes how could i dare find a wonderful man and start a family i am 35 they know i got on the pill at 16 i literally spent 18 years actively not getting pregnant i do not know why or how they think i forgot how babies are made or what a condom is or something jerks ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,everything written above my parents have been almost completely weird and indifferent about my pregnancy it will be their first and possibly only grandchild and it hurts like hell that they do not seem to give a shit but i also cannot control them we used to be so so close you are completely entitled to feel sad and shitty and hurt because this shit is fucking killer but also try to put yourself in your fiance shoes you say he being so completely amazing and wonderful and supportive and you need that but he needs you too he needs to know you always have his back no matter what and that he can trust you to put his and his daughter best interests over everything else even your parents despite your pain especially considering how your mom is acting if you have trouble imagining going no contact think about how you would feel if your roles were reversed think about how horrible these people are being to this person who is so wonderful to you and for what shitty stupid reasons and let yourself get angry about it you should be it not your responsibility to try and find the kind loving mom deep inside your mother and bring it out it not your job to comfort her through your adult life choices all of that is completely 100 on her to do sometimes for me it feels like i have such an amazing supportive caring partner and a few friends and family who are the same that it only fair that i put up with the people who treat me like crap i have fucked up a lot in life and it fair for them to act like i am a burden or a fuckup and to continue to act disappointed in me but that not true and it not right you deserve to be happy you deserve people in your life who love and support you and who care about your happiness not that you only do things the way they think things should be done ,5,BabyBumps
clara535,omg my dad does not even watch fox news i do not even know where he gets this crap he still mostly my dad has the same basic views i do and that he always had but then sometimes he busts out with something ridiculously cruel or inhumane that frankly a little insane for any reasonable adult to be saying i am glad it not just me it happening to but it also scary ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,these are amazing do you happen to know which baker i am having a shower in austin and i kinda want something similar ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,you are definitely not alone today marks 13 wks for me and my nausea terribleness has all but disappeared but he still smells a little off for weeks i could not even deal with being near him i love him so much and i felt so awful about it and also could never tell him or he would feel humiliated i just did a lot more rubbing hand holding than actual snuggling with my face brushing my teeth or putting on perfume made me smell that instead and a couple times i held a candle under my nose for a few seconds ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,i want all the privacy forever i have told family and close friends and i really do not care if anyone else knows but only as long as they do not talk to me about it like my mom has been telling co workers i am never ever going to see these people so i know they are never going to be touching me or asking me about pregnancy baby stuff so i am fine with them knowing i do not want anyone visiting at the hospital or really anytime for a couple weeks after the baby is born i just want to be left alone with my family and not have to made socially awkward conversation while i am breastfeeding or whatever i really do understand where you are coming from if i worked at a big company where lots of people would be looking at me and talking to me all day i would be really stressed ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,oh this drives me up the wall prepare for what exactly an infant i am preparing for an infant by learning to to feed and diaper and care for an infant i am not exactly worried about it embodying the correct gender specific ideal or being sufficiently attractive to the opposite sex i am only 12 6 and i did not start looking at baby clothes until this last week it insane how gendered everything is i really had no idea ,4,BabyBumps
clara535,oh man you sound like me i did not want to tell anyone i hate big announcements and i am awful about important news i do not say anything for way to long and then try to slip things into conversations like it no big deal and people get really mad honestly i see no flaws in your blurt it out and run plan do what you are comfortable with for me i only told close friends and family know i do not really have any intention of announcing on fb or to the world in general if people find out fine if not i do not care i was stressing super hard about telling my parents and in laws both had said some negative things very recently about the possibility of us having kids both sets of parents and my friends seems fairly indifferent except my friends with children and one cousin who are excited life itself is kind of a journey to not caring what other people think and this has been a huge step for me in that both in dealing with being hurt by others reactions nonreactions and realizing it does not matter if you are happy and your partner is happy that all you need a couple supportive friends are icing on the awesomeness cake anyway sorry i kind of made this about me i just meant to share my experience for support i am sure people will be happy for you and try not to dwell in the ones who are not also your mil sounds like a justnomil i am really sorry you have to deal with that bucket of bullshit best of luck ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,guys like that really enjoy drawing attention to their genitals it revolting they do not care if you are grossed out just that you noticed i really hate this person glad you talked to your boss about it keep documenting shit he does even if you do not say anything just keep a record ,4,BabyBumps
clara535,she amazing congratulations thank you for sharing your story ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,well that now my go to response for when random people touch my belly i am really constipated so who knows what you are actually rubbing lol thanks seriously this is gold ,13,BabyBumps
clara535,i am happy and excited about having a child but towards to actual baby inside me i feel a sense of responsibility but that really it to be fair there a lot going on in our brains right now for me this was a planned and very wanted pregnancy but i am just now coming to terms with the fact that i have a human growing inside me it my first and i am 35 and tbh i was very wary and terrified of getting attached in the first trimester i am 12 3 so those particular concerns are starting to vanish i feel like i can get excited and make plans and also i can almost eat regular people food again so we will see how it goes seriously it pretty normal my closest friend who had kids whose phone i have been blowing up every couple days with questions was the same way try to give yourself a break and not worry too much about how you feel now ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,yikes ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,thanks for the list and also why have i never purchased a period towel ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,awww he perfect congrats ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,it like the universe has a quota of medical problems to give out but it was lazy and it just gave them all to pregnant women ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,what i have never heard of that i thought it was allergies that were temporary it feels like someone punched me in the bridge of my nose glad to hear it not just me but geez ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,that so awful i am so sorry your parents are putting you through this i admire the hell out of what you are doing you are awesome your parents being hurtful and manipulative are not first world problems like everyone else said they are just trying to get their way and it does not really sound like you can rely on them to come through on any of these promises and you know what you should tell them exactly what you wrote here if someone is insulting you to try to get their way even if it your dad you are definitely allowed to call them on their bullshit at that point mom made it clear to me she does not want to take care of my child or when i needed help at x time you refused to help me and you promised me a great job if i did what you told me to before and that was a lie i cannot sabotage my career and my family future just so you get your way are all perfectly fine things to say and maybe you will even get some answers or straight talk please do not feel too guilty about making them feel things you are not responsible for that their decisions and treatment of you is and if it comes down to it remind them of it do not let them put that on you i agree that feeling not being in control does suck but it sucks way more to not be in control of your own life than it does to feel guilty that you are not letting someone else do it i have had a lot of friends and family whose parents promised to pay for school buy them a house and let them just pay the property taxes and the like and most of them did not come through or demanded more money repayment and the younger generation ended up screwed and relationships strained or broken i do not know your family and i am not saying that will happen but these were all well to do people if it not about the money it about control but it always becomes about one or the other and someone wanting more of it just my 2 cents again you sound like such a cool person and i am really sorry you are going through this you should be over the moon about your career and family not being made to feel bad about anything you do what is best for your family and hopefully one day your parents will be able to respect that and love you for who you are not just what you are to them ,17,BabyBumps
clara535,people like that are usually super know it alls rationalizing their own crappy reasons for making their choices i want to reiterate the reasons are crappy not the choices i am going to be a sahm because that what we both want for our family also i have a disability which makes it extremely hard to depend on income from me working also it will be cheaper that way because i do not have a career or a vehicle because of my disability as well as the fact that i made some shitty life choices i am not gonna sugar coat that shit and i am certainly not going to act like it because i am better than someone else if i had been able to finish school and have a career i love maybe things would be different but they are not and every single situation is different and it hard enough to figure out what is best for yourself much less your spouse and children much less everyone else in the world why pretend everyone is the same and you know what is best for them all and i would pretend to agree with someone about almost anything if they spent an hour hassling me and it sounds like that what happens to this guy regularly ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,i am so glad everything turned out ok i know it been said but thank you for sharing your story congratulations ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,absolutely find a new doctor you have every right to be upset because that insane when you call a new place tell them specifically why you are looking for a new doctor you will be able to learn a little about them from their reaction and also hopefully they can get you set up fairly quickly with the necessary whatever to reassure you best of luck ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,ugh i know i worked in corporate restaurants and we were not allowed to just wait on people we had to incessantly nag them and describe various dishes or drinks they did not ask about and suggest all kinds of upsells and add ons even after they say they do not want it and if you do not and it ends up being a secret shopper you get canned such total bs that being said if i have to say no more than four times in response to the same exact question i am going to stop being nice about it ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,wow i am really admiring you right now thanks for the story and congratulations ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,oh man that stuff drives me crazy it my 2 reason for not finding out the gender another way this sub has been so helpful i never thought i would deliberately avoid learning whether i was having a girl or a boy but reading stories from here made me realize i would be super irritated about this so i am able to avoid that boo for pushing gender roles yay for reddit ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,congratulations just wanted to say thanks for writing it all out in so much detail stuff like this really helps me and probably other ftms i know that there no way to know what is going to happen but being emotionally prepared for stuff like painful hallucination surgery is so much better than not realizing that a possibility i am sorry your experience was yucky and crazy but i am super glad you and baby are healthy and recovering well thank you again for this ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,oh man i am so sorry you are going through this it so easy to feel any one of the things you are feeling all of them at a time is just awful i really think you should consider calling your doctor office and telling them you really need someone to talk to right now i am not a professional just someone with a lot of mental health issues but even having one conversation where i just say all the things i am thinking to a professional helps me a lot sometimes just knowing that i can is helpful if nothing else they could tell you worry about thing a right now talk to your boss about thing b tomorrow and deal with thing c in a week or suggest just about anything something to help you feel more in control and validate your feelings for me personally no matter how much real life support from friends and family i get sometimes i need an outside perspective and you can cry profusely and they do not act like that weird or act annoyed when you are blubbering and you have to repeat yourself it admirable that you acknowledge all the things you need to do to make stuff work correctly and deal with life but you should cut yourself some slack you are not a character in a movie and magic is not real you are not any less amazing for acknowledging that you may need help in some form it true things may not get done if you do not do them but you also wo not get less tired and emotional and exhausted if you keep pushing yourself to do all the things the most important thing you can do right now is not paperwork or planning it staying healthy and sane again not a professional but you can pm me if you ever want to rant to an internet stranger i hope you can find some help and some peace right now ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,but how will i know who to feel superior to if more poor and uneducated people are empowered to make better decisions ,1,TwoXChromosomes
clara535,i had no idea how badly i would react to basic human body stuff i used to be kinda squeamish about some things not blood or scabs or anything but like the idea of touching veins and organs through your skin or if someone says feel this and they have a cyst or something but i thought i got over it in my teens somewhere now it back in full force i felt a skin tag or something in my belly button in the shower and i threw up i still do not know what it looks like and i cannot bring myself to find out i can only read so much of a pregnancy book at a time doctor appointments made me feel like a stupid kid because i should be totally cool with everything but it icky and weird i feel like a horrible childish monster but everything about this entire process is horrifying and gross to me right now sometimes it all i can do not to run screaming down the street like a madwoman even when i know that not going to solve anything i am still logical and healthy and i act normal and i really am thrilled about having a baby but man like somehow it would be too easy if i just had a regular farty peeing waddling boobpain hairy pregnancy without being in a constant state of squeamish anxiety i am really hoping this wears off with the rest of the horrible nausea because i do not know what i am going to do when i can feel the baby moving ,2,BabyBumps
clara535, i do not want to make the pregnancy such a negative experience for her this is pretty telling right here she definitely trying to make the whole thing about her and she succeeding she doing what she wants because she knows she will get away with it or at least get her way if she whines enough you are the one who is pregnant you are becoming a parent it a huge deal your body is going through crazy changes you are emotional and possibly sick and in pain and uncomfortable scared excited nervous and trying to figure out how you are gonna do all this neither you nor your husband need to be worrying about her having a negative experience you dh and both your in laws need to be worrying about what is best for you and the baby not what would get a bunch of attention on social media you are not being at all unreasonable or hormonal or mean and you should not feel bad because she stuck with you you are way more forgiving and easygoing about her insane behavior than many people including me would be it not so much about being protective of the baby it about the fact that she is not respecting either of you as adults having your own family she treating you like circus animals who exist to please and entertain her and enrich her facebook page i am not at all saying she doing it deliberately i doubt she is but at some point dh is gonna have to get on board with explaining to get that she is not running this show period and if she continues the craziness you are gonna have to give her real consequences ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,i love it i feel the same way also hoping for a brighter 2nd tri i still have some people to tell and i am thinking i will just text a picture of this because i am the worse lol,5,BabyBumps
clara535,wow do they not have dogs where you live on the bright side i am now assuming it not possible to injure yourself rolling your eyes because i suspect you would have done it so i can feel free to go nuts ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,aw poor guy i feel bad about feeling repulsed too i want to explain but i know it gonna hurt his feelings even though it just pregnancy hormones ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,oh god i like pickle juice i am glad that has not been ruined for me yet ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,how cool i would love to do something like that ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,lol glad you liked it it made me giggle but it makes my boyfriend mad he feels like i am getting really down on myself bless his heart yeah this smell thing i am ready for it to stop ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,i do not know about normal but it seems like fun i would love the henna on me the last one made me cry though ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,i do not discuss my relationships finances or medical stuff on facebook and this is basically all three so pregnancy is definitely out are you seeing someone p yeah you do not need to know that my mom massage therapist and my ex buddies and my 90 yr old great aunt do not need to know that i will tell you everything about the spider i dropped in the sink though wanna hear about that i really hate how people start acting like you owe them something now baby updates letting them touch you more baby updates telling them all about what your body is doing going to visit them to tell them about baby updates and your body and to let them touch you suggestions on birth plans breast bottle feeding fucking schools in the area oh we are going to buy you everything you need you can buy whatever you want i suppose but we are also going to buy what we need and we are going to get what we want you are welcome to supplement that after discussing what we want but i do not need you to supervise this entire affair and i do not appreciate being micromanaged i am the one having a baby with my partner of course he gonna also be a parent just because your relationship to the child had a noun associated with it niece cousin grandchild whatever does not give you the rights to my personal space in any way i am an extremely private person i have severe anxiety issues i cannot take anything for right now and i will thank you to respect my autonomy i may have gone off on my own little rant i apologize point is i agree with you i hate being treated like property or an idiot child who cannot take care of herself i know people mean well but so many of them are really just desperate for attention themselves and want to play little games and i have never had time for that shit and i certainly do not now ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,me too i love it what a sweetie ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,someone i think it was yesterday in another thread commented they respond with my goodness what a rude thing to say like a shocked old lady i loved this and definitely plan to use it anyway hope she shuts the hell up soon also to whomever originally came up with this sorry for stealing it it just the best ,19,BabyBumps
clara535,thank you so much for sharing your experience though i am really sorry you had to go through it i know you are busy but i too would write a letter to the hospital it would at least be nice if you could keep this or something much worse from happening to someone else i am a ftm due in november i plan to breastfeed and i have zero experience with babies i would never have thought to question the professionals before this reading this again thank you so so much ,33,BabyBumps

clara535,ftm here as well i am 10 5 very happy but still completely weirded out by this entire thing at least a couple times a day i come back around to holy shit i am pregnant i have had close friends who are similar to me tell me this goes away around when your kid is 2 so not holding my breath there i have known for almost 6 weeks it my first pregnancy and i am 35 i guess i have not really changed i have just got a lot on my mind trying to make sure i get everything done that i need done before the baby is actually here and trying to learn what i need to know i am trying to balance being excited with being cautious deciding who to tell and when figuring out what people tell me i have to buy vs what i actually need figuring out what my partner and i both want and discussing compromising making decisions and also realizing that a great deal of what i plan does not mean squat and will get thrown out the window when i actually give birth there a lot going on in my brain it all pretty positive and happy though ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,lol at raccoon rifling though a dumpster i ate the healthiest stuff before i got pregnant then my taste buds went all sewer rat i am over here eating 3 day old pizza crusts i find on the floor because stuff from my garden legit makes me throw up ,2,BabyBumps

clara535,my ex stepmother told us we should have sex in the evening because then we would get pregnant with a boy we had absolutely no plans to have children at any time she knew that because her friend raised cattle and that what they did it was a weird dinner ,26,BabyBumps
clara535,oh my god you are the absolute best for doing this would it be ok for me to pm you ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,what the shit i gotta say though it looks more comfortable than a lot of the maternity clothes i have found ignoring the fact that the bra is going to be too small for a great many pregnant women ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,my boyfriend has wondered out loud more than once how the toilet in our place stays so clean they seriously think it magic or something ,5,BabyBumps
clara535,you were not rude or unreasonable frankly her behavior is ignoring you is unbelievably childish i do not know the circumstances of her helping out whether she volunteered or you asked or what but maybe you should re examine the agreement if she going to make everything about her feelings or make you uncomfortable in any way that strain may not be worth the help of course it entirely possible your husband was not as tactful as he could have been in which case it kind of his mess to deal with dancin does not want you there in place of we would like some time to ourselves as a family is pretty uncool i do not think it unreasonable for you to ask him exactly what he said and to deal with her feelings about it childbirth is not a party no one should ever expect to be invited except the people who made the child my sil had 3 planned c sections and my in laws were there for all 3 i am fairly certain they are expecting to be present immediately after if not during the birth of mine in fact they are postponing a trip to europe for it and have made that very clear we have already planned not to call anyone until we are comfortable having visitors they are just going to have to live with that ,0,BabyBumps
clara535,thank you for this i kinda needed to hear it mine can be pretty frustrating but that is way better than the alternative ,10,BabyBumps
clara535,setting boundaries is hard and it sucks easy to say but when it involves the feelings of people you have to deal with for most of your life it just plain sucks and it really sucks that it on you to do it she and family in general should just be decent and respect others period without having to be told please do not act like a child this is not about you and leaving you out of the whole thing treating you as an afterthought is shitty asking to see pictures of your stomach is weird and sharing your personal information on the internet is super gross just saying all that to maybe make it easier on you personally i dealt with this by sitting down with my boyfriend and well telling him how it is not something i like to do i dislike demands ultimatums but this was absolutely necessary i told him that i need him to have my back period that i need him on my side and to take my side no matter what i will not always be in a position to politely tell my mil no and i need him to keep me from stressing about that i said if he unsure about my choices to think about how i have always acted in regards to his family their feelings etc if he can honestly say he thinks i am going to be bitchy and selfish and unreasonable he should have thought of that before he decided to have a child with me it works in my favor that he has much worse social anxiety than i do i just asked him to put himself in my shoes he been fantastic about it i do not think it was even just what i said more that i put it in terms he could understand anyway hope maybe this can help best of luck to you i really hope you work something out ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,no they wo not i was a 36g i am 9 weeks and the 36h i got 4 weeks ago is way too small now i mean come on they were overkill to begin with and what are they even doing at 9 weeks seriously thanks a ton for the brand advice every time i start looking at maternity clothes bras included i end up raging then crying and of course not buying anything because who knows what i am going to need in 2 months or whatever ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,you know i did not even think of that i am so sorry lol i totally derped on the insurance thing i am glad you are talking to them i really hope it goes well ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,god no kidding i cannot tell you how many times i have been told i am lucky that i do not have kids yet first of all it not luck it called birth control my life choices are conscious decisions i am making are you saying you wish you did not have children as though that was not something you had control over second how am i lucky to have to deal with all this awfulness you are describing in my thirties rather than my twenties i mean theoretically would not have that been easier i mean i am 35 i purposely spent almost 20 years not getting pregnant it not like i just now realized that was a possibility and decided to do it like i would decide to try a new cereal i am really lucky in that i got pregnant in less than a year without help and it going well so far i cannot imagine how offensive and hurtful those comments could be to someone who did not have that kind of luck maybe i am just extra sensitive and pregnant and cranky but it really grinds my gears when small talk involves shitting on someone else life choices ,11,BabyBumps
clara535,i am glad you got a doctor note but i am pretty pissed that you had to because this shit is ridiculous if it a big enough company to have a district manager and hr at all it big enough to have to also worry about breaking the law you have been trying to do the right thing and be a good employee and help them out for what to make sure you get a good reference or have a job to go back to your manager does not sound particularly reasonable or like she has any intention of making life easier on you i would not count on that at this point i would seriously write a e mail to hr or someone higher up even though you already talked to them telling them exactly what you have said here and straight up ask them what they plan to do about it anything in in writing that 1 makes them aware there are actual real health hazards laws being broken and 2 put the ball squarely in their court as far as solving the problems obviously you do not have to do any of that but it might benefit you in the future i do not trust this company to do anything decent or legal ,10,BabyBumps
clara535,oh man i had no idea i was supposed to make a big cute surprise thing out of this i feel bad for him now i just waited until he got home from work and told him so i took the pregnancy test it was positive and he went into weird not talking mode and hmm maybe it was better this way we are both weird um though if i was going to maybe leave the positive test out on the bathroom counter and ask him to get you something from in there ,0,BabyBumps
clara535,when i was about 7 weeks i had not seen my ob yet either i suddenly started bleeding it did not feel like getting my period it felt like i was peeing on myself went to the bathroom and sure enough it was bright red blood we went to the er because i had no idea what else to do but imo it was quite a lot of it like it filled the pad i wore to the hospital enough that i had to wear one of theirs and then there was quite a bit in that one they did an ultrasound and everything was fine he said my cervix was closed i spotted for several days after that as well brown spotting i had an appointment 10 days after that and everything is still fine they did not say what may have caused it but everything appears to be fine now so hopefully that will be the case with you the intake nurse told me they have a lot of pregnant women come in with that happening and everything is usually alright she said until they tell you everything is not alright try not to worry i do not know how true this is but i thought it was nice of her to say and maybe it will help you best of luck with the waiting i know how awful that is hope it all turns out alright ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,alright my first thought was fuck all that living room sleepovers are for 12 year olds not pregnant married couples who work full time i do not think you are being selfish at all and you have nothing to feel guilty about it sounds like she being manipulative and lazy and awful but as someone pointed out there a chance something is wrong with your bil and you would regret not going and it entirely possible you wo not get another chance for a long time if nothing else say i guess we can make one more trip before the baby comes and only stay one day to minimize the horribleness of sleeping in someone living room god just typing that made my heart rate go up anyway maybe going now would get you out of future guilt trips actual trips either way you have completely legitimate reasons for not going you should not feel bad at all if you do not ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,i am so sorry you are going through this i am in a similar position although it his mom that is making a thing out of us getting married my family has not even brought it up the idea that we would not be married and one of us would have a different last name than our child used to really bother me but since i found out i was pregnant i realized i honestly do not care at all baby talk aside the most important thing in the world is how you guys feel about each other if you both know what you want and trust that the other person is on board it honestly does not matter what other people say as much as it hurts when your other loved ones are not being supportive not to get too cliche on you but life is long and hard and you are going to go through a lot together paperwork and laws and names are the things that are going to take a backseat to the life you are making together i am really sorry your family is reacting horribly to your decision but it your decision you are the one filling out the paperwork if nothing else just smile and nod and agree with them and then do what you want when the time comes ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,yes pizza and donuts all that kale i planted in the yard for delicious salads i cannot even look at it anymore i forced myself to eat some spinach and i threw up really i can only eat exactly what i want or i get sick and what i want is crap i want cheese junk meat refined white flour soda cheese and corn chips i can tolerate ice water most of the time my poor boyfriend has gained so much weight since this started ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,yes i used to take several medications all of which i stopped taking when i started ttc and the dreams stopped with them now i am pregnant and they are back yet another thing i did not know to expect they are a little more nightmarish than the med dreams and also i am usually eating in them now ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,that incredibly frustrating and infuriating and honestly kind of unacceptable no you not suicidal but that does not mean you are ok it not an either or situation it very irritating and extremely counter productive to make people feel bad about about asking for help and to make them do it repeatedly i would be very wary of taking something prescribed to me by someone i have never met at the request of someone who seemed like she was not really listening waiting sucks too but you might have to weigh that against the hassle of taking a new thing long enough to know how if it works figuring out how you feel about it and weaning off of it to be able to take another thing i hope it works out for you and soon i stopped taking all my meds before i started ttc and at 9 weeks i am still wondering if i did the right thing best of luck ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,thank you for this i have horrible anxiety problems and i have been wondering how others deal with this i am also a ftm and planning on breastfeeding i am really glad things have improved for you and hope they continue to do so sounds like you are an amazing mom ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,congrats very glad to have you here ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,oh god i want to check that out but i am worried i will get worked up and have crazy eyes for a while ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,it possible i am also grumpy but i also despise people telling me what to do and you sound extremely reasonable ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,man i am trying not to feel overwhelmed but we do not really have any birth plans yet except for what we discussed after she called yesterday i just found out 3 weeks ago and i had no idea how sick i would be how much time it would take to apply for all the insurance and find doctors and the hoops they would make me jump through before i could even make appointments between that and going to the er and feeling like crap i have just been trying to learn as much as i can and stay positive and sane with his b and sil i know several people visited the day of and after to hold the baby for extended periods of time obviously that not what i intend to happen but it going to make any different decision a really hard pill for her to swallow thank you for the info so much i am going to make an extra effort to go to all the classes i can make and get him to come too ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,that bananas it always easy to say i would just tell so and so it her baby and i am doing what i want except actually doing that is so hard and they know it and that why they do it ugh ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,oh man i hope stuff happens for you soon ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,i am sorry to hear that i hope things continue to get better i sometimes feel neglected at the age of 35 i know it stupid because my parents are not in touch nearly as often as most of my friends i think they are going out of their way to not be obnoxious but then get busy and tired and realize they have not texted me in 3 weeks lol ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,at first i was slightly annoyed at you putting this thought in my head lol because frankly no i do not i like her i really do i just need my life my marriage and my impending family to not revolve around her that first day or night is going to be my partner and me holding the baby sleeping learning to nurse etc i am going to be cranky and exhausted and happy and in pain and i do not need to feel like i have to wrestle my child away from someone else that all assuming i have a healthy baby on time with no complications etc i am not a pessimistic person but i am realistic if they postpone this trip she going to be going on and on to everyone about it and use that as an excuse to make an even bigger fuss if she does not get her way we both said to them before and today that we do not want them postponing the trip she insisted bf is really stressed because he knows he going to end up being in the middle of this i love him and i stress about making him choose between her and me and the baby but i told him if it comes to it he knows which side he gonna have to take anyway sorry i do well with talking about stuff and i do not have a lot of people to talk to honestly thank you for asking this when he gets home from work we are going to need to have this conversation and i otherwise may not have ever thought about it ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,mind if i ask which one you got this is the one purchase i am insisting on making myself ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,omg thank you 14 99 i am so excited right now i am an h cup but i just want something soft and comfy to sleep in because being braless hurts so so much ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,i am sorry you are having a rough time that sounds awful i used to be kinda overweight i lost some and am back to a much healthier size for me but only because for the past year or so i have been trying to be very aware of what i am eating how much only eat if i am hungry etc i am only 9 weeks but i have been nauseous almost all the time including when i feel hungry i feel fine while cooking and eating and feel sick again as soon as i finish eating it really hard to figure out when i have had enough or too much or whatever because none of the signals my body is sending me are normal for me and they keep changing i guess what i am saying is that feeling sick is not always an indication you are doing anything wrong it completely normal as is feeling anxious about it though you have more reason to be so than most as far as advice you could write down what you are eating and ask your doctor about it but please try to give yourself a break as you said you have made changes and are trying for your baby sake do not beat yourself up over the part of it you cannot control ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,it was more the tone of well this is the birth of our grandchild it a really big deal to us and the long list of reasons she wanted to take the trip at that time but now she has to postpone it etc i get the question being fair but it one she could have easily just texted me or googled and actually already knew the answer to and was pretty much just calling so that i would be more aware of how everything was affecting her specifically she said her other dil had all scheduled c sections i did not even know you could do that but i told her that sometimes some babies take longer to cook and that i am not really in charge of when it comes out ,4,BabyBumps
clara535,i have a galaxy s6 active and it always telling me be more active i am like go fuck yourself then i drop it and thank it for still working ,6,BabyBumps
clara535,i hate those dreams so much i do not have them as much as i did when i was younger but still i think they are relatively normal my boyfriend has them too but they still totally suck ass we just wake each other up and solicit sympathy snuggles it may not stop your brain from being all crazy but it makes it better at the time ,2,BabyBumps
clara535,my cousin and i call it the spanish inquisition because its chief weapons are well can be fear and suprise and also the color red ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,i also think you should file a complaint as has been said not to get her in trouble but potentially to help other patients to put it mildly if she does get in trouble it of her own making not yours her attitude and actions are not acceptable in any customer service situation much less in healthcare ,3,BabyBumps
clara535,god that infuriating i am so sorry you are dealing with that i am only at 8 weeks so i know and do not know what that feels like and i am really not looking forward to finding out sometimes it like they are jealous that we get to be emotional without thinking about the actual reasons for it and try to compete or something because they are not feeling special sending you positive vibes and strength to not scratch anyone eyes out ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,oh god or all the people who talk about how big infant boys genitals are jesus wtf is wrong with you i am not at all saying genitals are gross or weird just that when someone initial comment about well any child really is expressing joy over the size of them is just wrong af ,5,BabyBumps
clara535,this shit is so hard to deal with because almost everything you could possibly do or say is going to be met with an overreaction about how crazy sensitive you are for not going along with it all i tend to go for the extra extra calm treatment i act like the agressor is the crazy person other people tend to follow the social cues that make them seem most normal so it tends to work like when he shakes your chair just really calmly say please stop when he says anything at all why that did not hurt what is your problem or whatever just keep looking at your screen or whatever shrug and say i just do not like it it puts the burden of confrontation escalation on him rather than you or when he demands your snacks just say sorry i did not bring enough for everybody do not look at him and do not engage when it comes down to it you are not obligated to interact with him socially and if it does not have anything to do with work he cannot really make a big issue of you not doing something as for work stuff like that e mail thing i would say something like give me a minute i am writing an e mail about it to you and group as soon as i am done i will tell you everything i just e mailed you or something along those lines i know i probably sound super rude or mean or manipulative but dammit i hate confrontation too and sometimes you have to be creative to establish boundaries or even basic fucking autonomy it sucks but sometimes it the only way to do it that is not waiting until you are ready to scream or do something kind of nuts for instance i would spit the snack i was chewing into my hand and offer him that or go shake his chair and when it did not shake him because he much bigger i would comment on how much harder it is to shake him and laugh and kick and hit his chair harder and harder or something anyway you get the point i am insane and i am genuinely annoyed that this is happening to you man ok and about your lunch i would actually ask in front of people like look at your wrapped lunch and look at him and ask how he knew what it was because that weird and creepy and frankly i would like to know too ,1,BabyBumps
clara535,from the comments it appears this is fairly common but it also seems like one of those things no one talks about like can we please acknowledge that men may have different reactions and feelings so i do not feel like a crazy person my so has gone on and on about wanting a family since we met i found out two weeks ago i am pregnant and i told him and he was kinda like oh well you wanna go to sonic they have fish sandwiches because it lent and he been all over the place with you want some coffee or i want to renew the lease for a couple years we live in a tiny one bedroom house i finally had to sit him down i explained that i cannot just stop thinking about it it very real to me because i have 40 things i have to think about at all times a ton of things to plan and do and there a definite deadline for these activities it turns out a lot of his unhelpfulness and frustration stems from feeling so useless and not knowing what to do he cannot stop eating certain things or throw up for me he cannot fill out all my paperwork etc and he never done this before either so he does not have any advice to give i had not realized that i would have to make him understand that this is something he is involved in lol and not just tangentially we are having a baby not me this is not something me and his mom can just deal with for him so he can snuggle a happy baby when it convenient for him i maybe was not tactful during the conversation as i would like to say i was basically i had to give him the job of being my moral support my sounding board and even sometimes my buffer when it comes to other people i said that there are things i need from him that i cannot do myself or get from anyone else and if i did not think he could do them or i did not respect him or his advice that i would not be having his baby i guess i just tried to make him feel involved and important and like he has some control over the situation ,1,BabyBumps

clara535,this is hilarious though i am sad his friend got broken ,31,aww
clara535,oh man a few years ago a new restaurant chain opened in my hometown and i waited tables there for a while we were told in training that if a customer mentioned a food allergy to always always get a manager straightaway i assumed this meant the manager would talk to the customer and oversee the food being made you know so people could get good service and to avoid causing actual physical harm to paying customers on the first or second day after we opened a lady told me she was allergic to gluten and i told the only manager who i thought was not an asshole she told me just to tell the lady to just order corn tortillas instead of flour the woman had not even ordered yet so this was nonsensical as well as wrong it was a mexican food place and the tortillas were made together on the same table and served in the same containers i got written up for telling the customer exactly what happened when i spoke to the manager rather than bullshitting her and making her sick fuck all that i am not lying to people and possibly making them extremely sick because you are lazy and greedy now i am all mad again ,11,AskReddit
