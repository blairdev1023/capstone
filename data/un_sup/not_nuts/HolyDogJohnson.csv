HolyDogJohnson,ehh not wanting to invest unpaid time into work is not indicative of lesser work ethic in my book first of all because some of have needs outside of work that help keep us stable theoughout the work week and often a lot of people devote time and work to personal projects so really work ethic is not indicated by desiring personal time ,11,UpliftingNews

HolyDogJohnson,that my point though what if stagnation of thought is inherent to age and weight of experiance is the cause of senility ,1,pics
HolyDogJohnson,you are assuming senility and stagnation is a physical problem which is my point how do we know that senility is not inherent to living that long ,2,pics
HolyDogJohnson,i agree but can you imagine a 300 year old man who has been senile and stagnant in his thinking for the past 220 years of his life blech even if he was mobile and healthy that would be hella hard for a democratic society to overcome ,4,pics

HolyDogJohnson,it dead i hate when people do that crap assign psuedo respect to a deceased thing no if your dog was alive and you asked if it would mind having another thing take its place after death it would just wag its tail and try and get pets dogs dont give a shit about that alive let alone dead people are a little trickier when i die burn the body or leave it to rot in the sun i cannot care anymore but rituals relating to death are for the living only the people who the dead left behind care what is done with the memories of the dead no matter that a person can try and dictate certain things before death those only matter until they do in fact die ,4,aww

HolyDogJohnson,no there is a subtlety you miss you can teach about anything religion science maths literature what you cannot do is teach any one of those with the state sanctioned authority of schools for the particular purpose of enforcing your opinion climate change is not an opinion any unfounded opinions thereof such as say if you think it means we should go to war with countries over it are not okay to be enforced within those institutions you could even explore the impact it has on wild life and assign an essay to explore the opinions that are around hell by that definition you could have a study abroad program that the point of was to explore and contrast the poorest americans live with the places the poorest cambodians live or any of that you could even set it up for them to get a perspective on where they live based on where and how others live the only thing you cannot do is set it up either expressly or through subtlety to have the government enforce your desire for them to feel the way you do about something if that does not explain what i mean well enough then i really cannot do much more i probably wont reply anymore i have been here before and frankly i am lazy and do not have a whole lot of pride to defend and i am not terribly stubborn and i do not care what you think that much ,1,MURICA
HolyDogJohnson,i was in school about 5 years back had siblings in it after that schools are pretty close to fascism as is but that is beside my point lets say i dont have a problem with modern schools ideally schools teach facts and skills if you want them to learn about life in other countries more extensively than they do now that is fine if you want them to learn about it so that they can formulate opinions and ideas about the world even better if you want them to see the world so that they can know how good they have it that is using a government run compulsory education facility to enforce an opinion which is fascism ,1,MURICA
HolyDogJohnson,my point was not at all about mind control my point was that you need to be careful mandating things through the government because you cannot legislate opinions when you try it becomes fascism and lets be clear the appreciation you are describing is opinion i really did not want to type that out and would have preferred you just taken the spoof it was a little less personally ,0,MURICA
HolyDogJohnson,i use my drawing notebook ,1,LifeProTips
HolyDogJohnson,do not agree with this it is fascism in fascism the ruling class dictate what is proper and you have to agree or be dealt with ,1,MURICA

HolyDogJohnson,god fuck i flat out said that i think trump is this worse option your failure to take into account the reason hillary lost is your bias and what is this nonesense about nuclear war it has not gotten there or close yet if you do not accept that others have valid concerns you will only widen the gap ,1,politics
HolyDogJohnson,actually just poignant it is not any more edgy than the comment he responded too it was point counter point both points known to be true unions are susceptible to corruption and forgetting their purpose and unions also leverage the workforce to get fair compensation and employment rights your comment is the edgiest one i see ,20,todayilearned
HolyDogJohnson,your bias is showing i hate trump he was the worse of two options but the middle class feels used by half assed compulsory health care that is more expensive and now forced upon us that is why america did not vote for the snake and instead voted for the baboon because democrats fucked with the middle class and a filthy lying democrat seemed to some a worse continuation of a problem ,-2,politics

HolyDogJohnson,are we really treating russia that poorly they have a decidedly antagonistic approach to the western nations which breeds similar responses from us especially with the clear corruption within the oligarchy that they call a government and a less modern culture not to say we are much better but lets just say i would rather be middle class in america than the same in russia ,2,worldnews

HolyDogJohnson,i have now which is nice funnily i have never downvoted you guys never tried to suppress you only lightly spoken against you when you assail my eyes with your euphoric and generally toxic opinions and posts and yet i am met with your kind of response i think you are wrong not all of you but a majority but you wont hear it or any criticism because you are so sure you are right supporting a man whos does not know or care for knowledge or history or wisdom a demagogue who wants to change laws that are very nessacary because he does not botherer to understand their purpose spez was wrong to feed the trolls but i love his solution ,1,The_Donald
HolyDogJohnson,i am really glad you guys no longer get to inflict your memetic support of a demagogue on me i work with the actual people who voted for trump and none of the shit you have spouted reflects any true majority most poeple who voted for trump didnt think he was a good option they just got fucked by obama and liberals and know hillary is a lying supercunt ,-6,The_Donald
HolyDogJohnson,less insidious than that antivax if you want solutions a unified tipping program would be one solution i would use the system could be set up so that a person could donate 5 cents in exchange for veiwing the requested page instead of ads that is already better payout per view than they where getting from ads ,1,technology
HolyDogJohnson,yes ,1,technology
HolyDogJohnson,more concerning to me me is that this would even be considered in court for half a second these are literally just programs on your computers that change how information is displayed no company has any more right too how i display the information on my screen than they have the right too my choice of blinds on my windows they can choose to make ads on their website i can choose to filter that information to exclude the ads ,7,technology
HolyDogJohnson,hyper sensory awareness thought processes and computational abilities sped up and made far far more advanced my form would be normal but inclined to shift and deform revealing eyes big and small like alucard from hellsing except much more subtle if you where to look at me you would not see anything until you stared then you would see subtle wisps and shifts in my outline and when i moved things would not look right the blur of my movements would sort of roil and you would perceive eyes in the roiling wispy blur and the shape of smoke trailing behind and when you were not looking out of the corner of your eyes my form would dance and deform like a cloud of smoke and fire and eyes thousands of eyes would be looking watching ,1,dresdenfiles

HolyDogJohnson,no i used words i thought where commonly understood turns out not again lesson i learned i keep it simple unless talking about it with someone who is actually interested ,1,iamverysmart
HolyDogJohnson,that could be but i hardly think that is a reasonable assumption to make based on my previous statements i say this because i was describing a specific thing learned when i was in highschool which was probably 6 years ago and really all i am saying is that up to that point it had not occured to me that being able to precisely dictate an idea in way that uses bigger words does not mean that you will be better understood like in a debate but it would help on a scientific essay or be good for literature in genral ,1,iamverysmart
HolyDogJohnson,that is true i suppose the way i am thinking is either scientific or poetic not as straight forward as other ways of speaking i suppose i was just surprised at how low the bar was ,0,iamverysmart
HolyDogJohnson,but really when i was in high school we used to do debates in english i learned that you can lose a debate because you use words that are great for describing what you mean but kids do not know what you mean this is not self aggrandizement either i just happen to like words that most accurately describe what i mean which means i become less intelligible to everyone else when i use them edit so to clarify i said everyone else meant certain highschoolers in my class but the allusion was that i had learned that it applies to everyone and now i do not pack sentences with information or use overly specific words if they are uncommon ,6,iamverysmart
HolyDogJohnson,i do not see fox on there ,-2,The_Donald
HolyDogJohnson,yes i disagree with some of your ideas so much that i have no desire to argue with you about them because only fools argue with fools now what it sounds like you enjoy is being among the simple because you can manipulate them ,-4,The_Donald

HolyDogJohnson,gross i did not vote and i dislike trump way more than i dislike hillary what is your prideful and gracious response to my kind ,1,The_Donald
HolyDogJohnson,i disagree on that point you already know what clinton will do and you could cuckold her with a house majority just like with obama ,1,The_Donald
HolyDogJohnson,i mean i think you are so fundamentally wrong that i cannot be bothered to have an argument with you about it on the racism thing and the fascism thing only fools argue with fools so you found your home among the simple frankly that is not very compelling it sounds like you found easily manipulated and love it ,-1,The_Donald

HolyDogJohnson,i have explained why i was offended i did not explain what happened look it up happened a month or so ago youtube started enforcing monetization guidelines ,2,videos
HolyDogJohnson,the problem is that i wanted to be ad free while my money that they share with content creators goes to the youtubers i support regardless of opinion of ad creators but they undermined my wants and desires and the content creators that i enjoy livelihoods in favor of ad creators the fact that i am a paying customer does not mean shit regardless of the fact that youtube is only an intermediary between me and what i desire so i chose to support content creators instead of an arbitrary middleman ,7,videos
HolyDogJohnson,i was a paying customer i paid for youtube red then they unilaterally started demonetizing videos so i stopped being a customer did not slow them down at all ,93,videos

HolyDogJohnson,so the discussion leads me to a magical bloodline question say one of the alphas joins or makes a pack letting his bloodline flow among the wolves what happens is terra west a product of such unions now what if a wizard female shape shifted and had litter or a male wizard sired young wolf wizards even farther what if a fae did such a thing what wild creature would that spawn ,1,dresdenfiles
