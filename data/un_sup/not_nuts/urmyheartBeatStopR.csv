urmyheartBeatStopR,to add to u theemuts erlang ways to handling fault tolerant is radically different than that of say nodejs nodejs you have to expect every single case almost like expect the unexpected this is assuming you can do that or you are god most of the time you probably will miss certain cases for erlang style you code for state you want your program to be and you drop all other using pattern matching if it failed then you basically let it crash and the supervisor will reset the state also when it fail it fails in a process well it really a thread that act like a process but anyway so it does not take down the entirely system it takes down that process in nodejs you got one thread and you can take down the whole system with one wrong code i think the biggest thing is the let it crash mentality supervisors to reset state processes and preemptive scheduling the preemptive scheduling makes latency low because erlang is aiming for latency over through put iirc so even if you somehow manage to create a process that do an infinite for loop it wo not hijack the cpu like u theemuts says you can have processes monitoring your processes or different parts of your programs and reset it to previous state if some weird shit happen i know it weird but it basically traditionally trying to catch all error events versus i want this program to do all this and everything out side of this ignore ,0,programming

urmyheartBeatStopR,define it i worked as a programmer for 5 6 years in web dev being a full stack it to us is people like system admin network admin geek squad people and whatever they maintain the computer and exisiting system they usually just do scripting backups keep the system up etc they do not do web app or dev software for business side if you are talking about that i think it rarer because of the cloud now and platform as a service suppose i am willing to work virtually unlimited hours and days for around 66 000 a year calculated as my current salary in a rich asian country increased by the amount of american taxes would i then have a decent chance to get a job in it it illegal to do that in usa smaller start up they will say it indirectly but i hated that industry been in that for 3 years it was fucked up doing 60 80 is not cool imo would it likely be a corporation or a startup type company corporations are the only one that can afford to sponsor h1b in my experiences if you cannot pass those crazy google test interviews then you are looking at non tech focus company google apple facebook are usually tech first company where they will have crazy interview since and if you cannot pass those you are looking at companies that are not really tech focus first an example would be yellow page imo they do tech interview but it not as crazy and they sponsor a shit tons of people i got a few friends that work there iirc they cut a few of my usa citizen friends either to save money or they had trouble but kept the h1b people i do not know many other just yellowpage since that what my friends were working at i know quite a few in tech focus company like google facebook and amazon and you can get it if you have phd really and pass the test it better off if you know someone from the inside to recommend you and prep you i know that media in the us tend to exaggerate things a bit so what is it actually like somewhere in the middle between these two i think it more toward the there is no shortage it just cheaper side from my experiences i got quite a few interviews where they just want me to be a web master and manage code they outsource to india china phillippines and such of course this is just my experiences but also there are more code boot camps now that teaching the bare minimum for people with no computer science degree or any back ground related so the hiring wage in web dev is a little depress now imo i left the industry to go back to school i am not sure how it is now but i think it just getting a bit worst i think you are better off specializing if you are in the web dev industry anyway good luck with that do not work too hard ,5,AskAnAmerican

urmyheartBeatStopR, nor do i think i have the mathematical aptitude to get the graduate degree i would likely need to advance in the field not with that attitude math is a skill and like with any other skill you just work at it until you acquire it deliberate practice i got a cs degree and it took me 5 years 6 years into my professional working career i wanted to do data sci so i am going back for applied stat it going to take me 3 years i felt dumb as fuck for the first 2 semesters but i am starting to understand what those fancy pant statisticians are talking about via blog and such i still feel dumb but shrug that just personal issue i gotta fix also intuition and developing math intuition is a slow processes but eventually it make things a lil easier an example of developing intuition is this youtube series for linear algebra https www youtube com playlist list plzhqobowtqdpd3mizzm2xvfitgf8he ab anyway like anything you have to sacrifice something for the skill time money tons of loans t t all balancing act ,2,datascience
urmyheartBeatStopR,my graduate book is wordy and uses old techniques where you have a full model and reduce model and compare the ssr or msr iirc it not a t stat since t can only do pair wise at most you need to do anova so an f test if you want to compare the significant and then do a post hoc which is i guess t test this is hardcore stat tho it been a while but there are other technique like press etc where it an algorithm to test how powerful your test model is and if you put more predictor into the model then it will punish you for it with some weight function https en wikipedia org wiki model selection update my class also cover aikake and mallows cp element of statistical learning the less mathy version talk about ridge regression and lasso to reduce the variable unfortunately my class could not cover that i know chapman university have two semester of regression and i believe they cover that on the second semester i am not entirely what you mean about variable bias but i know there are model bias and you do cross validation for that oh here the pca used in linear regression https en wikipedia org wiki principal component regression ,1,datascience
urmyheartBeatStopR,well it important in models stat multivariate stat i dunno why the other three comments having stated the obvious yet i think the other three are just fluff comments really but if you have millions of predictors you need linear algebra and linear algebra technique this is just very surface area but let talk about something you will encounter with a shit ton of predictors let say we choose linear regression as a statistical learning model the problem arises because the predictors correlate with each other having so many predictors in your model is a big no no it complex takes lots of computation and other stuff you will learn if you take linear regrssion course so in multivariate statistic you learn pca which uses linear algrebra techniques to reduce the dimensions predictors basically uses eigenvectors to project down to a lower dimension tldr linear algebra is the most important in modeling ,2,datascience
