bmonster32,are both the dogs in front shikokus ,1,shiba
bmonster32,thanks for the advise if i read you correctly shikokus and socialization plus training early on is a must and need good exercise each day they are not good dog park dogs and do better on the trail or street when walking keep an eye out for other dogs or people play can be violent and should have a referee to make sure things do not get out of hand if there is anything else you can tell me i would love to hear thanks for the info ,1,shiba
bmonster32,one thanks for the link and i am in contact with areyarisu kenneli which is not vary far from where i live plus thanks for the info on the kai and shiba it was vary helpful and i now know a little more about the breeds two things i look for in a dog i can find with shikokus are that somewhat less stubborn then shibas and are great outdoor dogs i like the loyalty they are said to give and i am prepared to be on my toes since their rep is known to be vary smart and possibly rude if there are any other things you can tell me i would love to hear thanks for your time ,1,shiba
bmonster32,so if i am hearing you correctly shibas require lots of training obedience training and time with owners are okay with going to places and require a medium amount of exercise if so thanks for your help ,1,shiba
bmonster32,you could get into space robotics if that the kind of thing you are into ,1,space
