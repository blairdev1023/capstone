crowleysnow,1 the game having a tutorial area does not mean it is not open actually what you do in the plateau is pretty open you can go do the shrines in any order and go do anything 2 you can go to the goron city without potions if you bring a ton of food not easy but possible 3 a cultural aspect of a town is not breaking the open nature of the game once you have the clothes you can go anywhere in the town would you rather have no goals based around location ,8,gaming

crowleysnow,this is fucking amazing ,1,CoolGamesInc
crowleysnow,i would argue that the good reason for naming her chalupa was foreshadowing the story right when taako umbrastaff wrote lup on the wall when he was with kravitz i saw a theory online that it was his long lost sibling named chalupa it was a dramatic irony sort of thing it changes nothing in the story but it changes how we the audience receive it she can be chalupa or lup and the plot would not change but the little bread crumbs of connecting the dots and discovering this clue are what make listening to a story fun when i first heard that theory i was blown away it was the most clever foreshadowing i had ever seen that little hint does not make much sense if her name is not chalupa because it just lup we cannot connect that back to the other tex mex named person in the group which means we cannot guess that it his sister and that she still alive somewhere i think that her losing her name and part of her mystery over fandom drama is a shame ,1,TheAdventureZone

crowleysnow,they already were doing something about it that something was the paris accords that obama signed that federal agreement even counts in individual cities and since they were already doing something and trump withdrew from that something they need to use their own power at the city level to re agree to it it like if your power grid went off so you had to use a generator the federal government climate deal went away so now you need a city state one ,7,Futurology
crowleysnow,no dude they are the one making sense here not you if you were a mayor and your president signed a deal it would be redundant to then agree to that same deal when the president withdraws from that deal is when the power to give support of it falls to you ,6,Futurology
crowleysnow,i am pretty sure it because before trump withdrew from the paris agreement the mayors knew they had to listen to the paris agreement already now that trump withdrew they have to double down on the support of it they had no reason to vocally support it before because it was assumed that every mayor was going to work towards it because the paris agreement was a federal thing ,2,Futurology

crowleysnow,i am from rural california trust me i probably know more about it than most moving from there to a big city is what i believe gives me the perspective i have the truth is that i believe it should trickle down to a city ordinance thing but the comment i was replying to originally mentioned states so that what i was going off of also it may get pretty sticky when moving a weapon from town to town so states with 95 of their citizens living in one place should worry about that one place first ,-4,AskReddit
crowleysnow,3 is what i think is the best argument against it i remember when i last took a government class that my professor explained that even if petty theft had a death penalty people would still probably do it less often yes but it would still happen if instead we focused our energy on making the theft harder with more guards and cameras and such and make sure every person who does it faces inconvenience for it like jail for a night a big fine stuff like that that it would go waaay down people have trouble seeing far into the future where very large consequences will be ,5,AskReddit
crowleysnow,that because those are the condensed and populated areas where guns can do the most harm someone in rural alabama cannot really hurt more than a few people before the police get to them and they have a lot to gain protecting themselves with them la on the other hand is where you can kill dozens if you wanted to and where there not much land in need of protecting that would take more than a small gun it not bullshit on either side it just how different demographics view the same problem gun control is one of the things that i as a liberal really genuinely think is a state problem i know the constitution states the right to an armed militia but restrictions on that vary wildly even from a city to half an hour away from it ,-8,AskReddit

crowleysnow,per capita is not a great signifier because a state with 1 1000 the size of california still has a base amount of gdp it will have just from existing and doing the bare minimum if the default gdp to function was zero it would make sense but it not and therefore a lower population state will look more productive just from doing what it does to keep itself running when we are talking this much scale and how many things and how much of those things california makes it undeniable that it the top dog ,5,politics
crowleysnow,that real great but when they are producing on such an extremely small scale compared to california i do not believe that a statistic that accurately portrays the information ,5,politics

crowleysnow,yeah your personal anecdotal evidence sucks and pretending you do not have feelings on the internet is not as cool as you think it is,4,AskReddit
crowleysnow,that not the same what if they said hey male over here it a reduction of you to your parts colloquial speaking that gender specific is just a substitute for a pronoun which is cool like hey dude get that for me or ma am come over here maybe even hey chick with the glasses come here but male and female are reductive and saying hey female makes it sound suspiciously like the default is male and that you are the odd one out like you would not be able to say hey male get over here unless you were in a room dominated by women where that would be your defining character trait i do not know about you but i do not think what should stand me apart is my having of boobs so there a difference language is nuanced using guy is not the same as using female ,4,AskReddit
crowleysnow,i feel like i maybe did not get across what i meant by simple here i meant it more in like this one thing i buy every few years and use daily in comparison to things that are a bit more sticky ethically speaking like food finding ethically sources food is a constant struggle for a lot of people it seems like every week a new company is doing some new shit to make it harder and harder so from a consumer perspective a phone is simple because it not purchased as often and unless you have enough knowledge to even know that more ethical sources exist it seems like there is only a binary choice between iphone and android it therefore lands the burden of knowledge onto the consumer to not actively fund slavery like the fairphone has been thrown around a lot in this thread but i did not even know it existed a month ago it should not be on my shoulders the consumer to make sure i am not funding atrocities it should be on the shoulders of the company to not make a direct consequence of buying their product be funding atrocities ,24,LateStageCapitalism
crowleysnow,yeah but as another top comment here said pointing out hypocrisy in this case is just a deflection no matter who made the argument it still true people who have iphones can say that iphones are made unethically and that it should change in fact if people with iphones did not say that it would be kinda fucked up the fact that they have an iphone does not negate the fact that they made a true statement ,51,LateStageCapitalism

crowleysnow,i do not think the point was that everyone had their own shit to deal with i thought it was definitely more like things will not stay the same as they are right now and that okay like the movie is in phases of things changing and charlie dealing with it in really unhealthy ways and a very large part of it is that he passively lets things happen to him without his actual input other than the very first befriending of patrick charlie just goes along with everything he dates mary elizabeth because she makes him he does not pursue sam because she does not initiate it he accepts when his friends avoid him he lets patrick kiss him a lot much more in the book than the movie and so on the few times where he initiates things in the beginning it largely goes wrong and discourages him such as him kissing sam in truth or dare he finally goes off the deep end when he realizes his friends are going to leave and if he does not do something he will lose them so he goes to the hospital he gets help and then the ending his friends come back in a sort of symbol that he going to do his own thing and not let himself passively watch the world anymore he becomes cool with change and happy with how things become ,2,AskReddit

crowleysnow,also it a thing because she changed styles pretty abruptly and people say she is missing or has new birthmarks from before,198,AskReddit
crowleysnow,maybe because they like her other songs cause she on the radio a ton and they hear that and like it ,10,pics
crowleysnow,there a difference adhd is attention defecit hyperactive disorder doing something active with your hands is something that makes sense and does help giving a hyperactive person something active to do that small and quiet is completely different than homeopathy ,2,dataisbeautiful
crowleysnow,other people are different i am a programmer and a ton of my friends have fidget objects because most of our time is spent reading and thinking and that leaves our hands open and the fidgets help me personally so saying that they do not help because they do not help you does not much make sense ,6,dataisbeautiful
crowleysnow,if it the placebo effect i do not quite really care it helps ,7,dataisbeautiful
crowleysnow,do i have to explain how spinners are different than drugs really dude i have adhd fidget items are helpful they drain the excess energy in the brain so that i can think these claims of medical benefit are of actual medical benefit ,10,dataisbeautiful
crowleysnow,i do not think in this case a clinical study is needed there evidence that fidgeting in general helps adhd and people with adhd say that it helps them and that all that really matters a clinical study would probably be giving people with adhd a spinner and asking them if it helps right now they are already saying it does,0,dataisbeautiful
crowleysnow,i think it fair to let kids who need them have them like not every kid needs to be treated the same and if a kid acts up then take it away from them specifically banning them in a blanket fashion instead of case by case is just kinda lazy and ignores the good they do like for your son ,4,dataisbeautiful
crowleysnow,well i only know the adhd side of it you will have to ask someone with autism if you want to know that but it like there constantly a feeling like you need to be doing something physical to think spinning a spinner or other such little things like that can sort of drain the pent up energy that clouding your mind for some without fidget objects they just get more and more antsy and can focus less it really difficult to explain but it definitely clears the mind ,4,dataisbeautiful
crowleysnow,to be fair a lot of kids with adhd and autism really do benefit from these they wo not die without them or something but they do help,26,dataisbeautiful

crowleysnow,the point of abortion being legal is a bodily autonomy debate let say that you get in a car crash and you are about to die if you do not get a replacement kidney your best friend has a matching kidney that they could use to keep you alive are you entitled to that kidney even if your friend donating it causes them immense pain can you force that friend to give you the kidney no obviously not you hope they will give it to you so that you survive but it is morally and legally their right to refuse you no matter what because at the end of the day it their kidney and they are in charge of it now take that and replace kidney with uterus does a fetus have a right to force a woman to give up her uterus for 9 months even if it means the fetus will die ultimately no it does not the woman does not owe the fetus her body parts the fetus hopes the woman gives it the uterus for a while but at the end of the day it is her uterus and she is in charge of it if forced donation of body parts to others was not illegal it would be an extreme violation of rights yes it can be sad when a woman aborts and you are allowed to personally feel anger frustration etc about the act but protesting the right of the woman to do it that a fruitless effort ,12,conspiracy

crowleysnow,1 putting bees in a hive bees make their own hive they would do that anywhere giving them a hive just saves them the effort of doing it themselves and it seems as though you do not know what beekeeping actually entails i feel as though you should visit r beekeeping and stop coming up with things to get mad about 2 again this is not the meat industry we do not kill bees and use their flesh for food we take care of bees and use them for pollination and for their excess honey in return they get protection from mites and diseases as well as food during the winter months where wild hives would have died out that is a symbiotic relationship that is normal and it is mutually beneficial the cow industry abuses cows until they are big enough to murder for their flesh these two are not comparable so stop trying to compare them ,2,LateStageCapitalism

crowleysnow,my sister got kicked out for sneezing teacher was an ass tho ,1,thatHappened
crowleysnow,you are putting words in my mouth i did not say that everyone who has a job is justified you yourself said that beekeeping is good for bees and i said that beekeepers should be able to find compensation for helping those bees the amount of harm they do is negligible at best and it empowers more people to become beekeepers who can then save more bees this has nothing to do with the meat industry who do not do anything for the benefit of animals it sounds to me like you are just trying to find something to get mad about ,3,LateStageCapitalism
crowleysnow,only a couple more bees probably get killed by people smushing them on accident we live in a world where people need to make a living and if beekeepers could not sell honey then we would have less beekeepers and therefore less bees ,3,LateStageCapitalism

crowleysnow,or to the people not the government or a giant company ,-1,funny
crowleysnow,this is just markedly not true i can think of tons and tons of brands that used to be good but now such that still have no quality competition because their competitors either got pushed out of the market or planned their own obsolescence singer sewing machines pyrex dr martens kitchenaid stand mixers macbook pro etc competitors know that if they both give out a shitty product with a high price people will accept it as the norm and they will both make money this is especially prevalent in isps they all decided to fuck their customers separately so that they could all make money that is what is factored into capitalism ,17,funny
crowleysnow,actually that was me and what i said was that i do not understand how they can think that after all of the things that could have been done to prevent this they did this and thought they were in the right i did not ask what rule let them do this ,8,funny
crowleysnow,in some circumstances sure it works but there a point where it stops working towards innovation and starts working towards exploitation take for example technology capitalism was amazing for how quickly it innovated technology because people wanted it companies realized though that if they made their product too hardy good durable etc that the customer would not come back and buy another one thus planned obsolescence became a thing and now phones break and laptops break and even small things like can openers are made of plastic so they they can break so that you can go buy another one maximize profit always is a bad way to run a more utilitarian approach would benefit in this situation this is of course just one example the western world always praises capitalism because it those who benefit from capitalism who have the power to get the message out about how great capitalism is ,20,funny

crowleysnow,that is possibly the dumbest statement i have ever heard ,2,Tinder
crowleysnow,well then that great and all but my experience is different i grew up in a place with a large portion of the population being a minority and there was a ton of racism and in fact where i grew up was las vegas which is in fact the definition of sexism turned into a city i have seen a lot of people get hurt because of who they are and the fact that your small isolated city did not have that does not change a single thing ,-1,Tinder
crowleysnow,that almost the exact opposite of what i said the past was shitty and it hurt a lot of people and if we ignore that it happened then more people are going to get hurt ,3,Tinder
crowleysnow,my point is that it is still very relevant not just for the sake of women but for men i want the men in my life to be able to have the things that females have better i want the females in my life to have things that men have better but i am not going to tear down a historically oppressed group for the sake of equality ,1,Tinder

crowleysnow,asians are and have been seen as the trophy minority and many use them as an example that racism is not real just because they have better things the assumption that asians are all smart is still a racist statement even though it gets them better grades and a better position in white peoples eyes and can you show me the statistic where it only concerns women do asian women make more than white women ,2,Tinder
crowleysnow,you cannot isolate the genders from their historical context it extremely short sighted did men ever have to overcome oppression to get educated to vote to get a good paying job maybe on an individual level but as a whole the answer is no you know who did minorities and women so when it said that they are kicking ass by doing all of this stuff it with the context that even as short as within the last century they were not able to and the fact that they are coming out of those thousands of years of oppression swinging is admirable stop distilling a statement until it something you can argue with ,1,Tinder

crowleysnow,this is in my opinion a narrow scoped view of the issue the topic of this discussion is something painful expensive and life changing for one gender and i do not believe the members of another gender can think of it as subjectively as they must they can objectively say yes birth hurts and is expensive but i bet at least a few of them rationalize that away compartmentalize it in a way that they can legislate guilt free from the pain they are causing women who are going to be parents or women who do not want to be women have the subjective outlook because they can realistically say that it could and probably will happen to them and they would be much more cruel to compartmentalize that and legislate it away like men could be able to having multiple world views included in a conversation will in my opinion always boost the value of the conversation had ,10,politics

crowleysnow,yes i think it should be taxpayers and yes i think it fair for the government to provide the option to live somewhere else if a place is too densely populated if someone is poor and down on their luck having the government say hey we will pay your transportation to this place where you can get some assistance for a while and move back wherever once you are on your feet is a great thing that a lot of people would take and i know half of the country is going to reject the idea but that does not mean we do not try the goal is a little more than half ,1,AskReddit

crowleysnow,compromise is the answer usually in the form of socialism capitalism has a problem where instead of doing what is best for society people do what is best for their company it leaves anyone who cannot be a producer or does not have good opportunities poor disabled homeless without any sort of way to get their way up the ladder communism leeches motivation we need to as a society draw a line that says no one can have these rights and opportunities taken from them but they can always have more opportunities like hard line on healthcare no one should not be able to have healthcare housing is another big one anyone should have a place to live in our society if we have a base like that where no one in our society can fall past that hard line we have drawn all the sociopaths can do whatever they want because everyone knows for sure that they themselves have their bases covered capitalism allows the exploitation of all of your assets by people who are sociopaths so does communism ,303,AskReddit

crowleysnow,you are a really bad person ,78,AskReddit
crowleysnow,to boil it down it like the book is trying to say white people can be just as bad as africans which as an argument runs on the implication that africans are bad in the first place it subversive in its time because it was though that white people were always better than africans but it still ran on a basis that africans were bad people and it just implied that white people could also be bad when immersed in african culture the base assumption is negative towards africans ,1,AskReddit

crowleysnow,i see what you are getting at but the comparison still runs on the idea that the african jungle is savage just that europeans can also become savage if they stray too far from good europe and too deep into the bad africa that still seems to put everyone in sub saharan africa at a lesser state it just blames their environment instead of their nature and then goes on to imply that savagery in their environment is unavoidable ,2,AskReddit
