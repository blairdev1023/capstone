SkoolBoi19,fucking would be the taking responsibility part both parties would be the man and woman i am really not trying to prove a point or make anyone mad my 14 yr old gf had a miscarriage when i was 16 i understand how lucky we got on that and if my wife got pregnant now i would prolly try to talk her into getting an abortion she would make a terrible mom there alot that happens biologically when people fuck ,-26,TwoXChromosomes

SkoolBoi19,i think he is talking about the literal definition of the word also i would argue that are society believes is relative modality so as someone has already pointed out it totally depends on your morality a fun thing i like to do is to research a point i disagree with like i am trying to prove that point play devils advocate we all know that stats are easily manipulated so as long as the methodology is good now i do not know anything about this specific situation so please do not personally attack me,1,OurPresident

SkoolBoi19,i honestly do not think trump calling warren pocahontas is racist the only thing i have seen her say in her defense of being a native american is that she has high cheek bones if i called a white person an uncle tom i would not think that was racist either however i would consider calling a black person an uncle tom as racist racially motivated i almost think our fundamental idea of what is and is not racist is different i had kkk members give me flyers to join in 6th or 7th grade my dad told me it was a group of idiots and the guy was gone by the time we went back to have a conversation with him the only black the kids were mix family in our school had their house burnt down because they moved on the wrong side of the railroad tracks my grandparents kicked my cousin out of the family because she married a black guy i have been apart of huge race fights between white nationalist and black gangs from a town 20 mins away i know real racist i have grown up around real racism there is a difference between being a shitty person and honestly believing that a person is less because of there biological make up warren is just trying to capitalize on whatever she can to get keep power just like everyone else in the world we are not wholly good or wholly evil we are all some were in between as far as the policy conversation that i really do want to have pick one that you think is racist and we will discuss it that what i was thinking the following are policies that the media has said was racist i just do not want to assume your views tpp voter id law travel ban border wall,1,PoliticalHumor
SkoolBoi19,what part of my comment is nonsense that i dont think warren is a native american because she has high cheek bones her words or that i believe that just because your a shitty person does not mean your racist i fully believe that trump would treat any person of any race the same i think he is only interested in what he can gain from that individual person now if you would like to discuss his policies and if how they are racist i would love too unfortunately i do not think you want to have a conversation i think you just want to be right this is 100 why the country is fucked because the loudest voices on both sides just want to be right ,1,PoliticalHumor

SkoolBoi19,its 65 if its higher on the base dmg then yes if its on the lower end and you have a better one then no there is a post named balancing crit damage and crit chance very good on how much cc you have vs cd the idea being too much dmg your not getting the crits to much cc not doing the dmg i want to say the top roll is 65 at 300 dmg so mod accordingly imo crit chance is still great to have because of how hard it seems to be to get to max crit chance ,1,thedivision
SkoolBoi19,do not know how much this will help but believe max roll is 575 on he gear and i want to say top roll for he mods are 170 please correct if i am wrong it seems to me that you really have to keep crafting until you get the right numbers armor maxes out around 4750 65 exocit resistance i think 35 i rolled all my gear either firearms or tech mod all stamina armor ad i am at 2k in all 3 i would suggest really getting an idea of how you want to build ur play style heal dmg dealer cc dmg dealer tank etc and then go for weapon talents that work with your build and the rest should just kinda fall in place ,1,thedivision
