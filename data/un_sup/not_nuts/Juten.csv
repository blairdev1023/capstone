Juten,i mean all i did was create a group policy for windows firewall blocking smb on workstations updated all servers already were protected anyways and monitored workstations with wsus was there more i should have been doing do not understand the slaving away certainly did not slave away over it ,1,sysadmin
Juten,thanks i think from this i am going to go forward with a security group added to local admins for workstations and a separate group for server local admins then preventing the account logon rights like you mentioned which seems to be working so far once we upgrade our domain functional level i will take advantage of the managed service accounts ,2,sysadmin
Juten,yeah that what i am doing now but those credentials need admin rights just trying to find a more secure way of doing things that second link you provided i actually did not come across before and is great information thanks ,2,sysadmin
Juten,yeah that what i was looking into last night but need 2008r2 functional level so that out until we get our 2016 licences ,1,sysadmin
Juten,thanks for the confidence boost been a bit nervous about how things are most services that can run local or system i have already corrected its just these in between accounts such as lansweeper that need admin rights across the network to do its business it seems my best option is to provide the rights it needs and secure it the best i can in ways of strong rotating password ,1,sysadmin

Juten,a will get you help desk positions and the like although not always required there are places out there with production environments involving imaging pc and servers that will tend to hire without certs because they have everything down to a process a monkey could do these places are great for getting some exerience on your resume and usually with proving a little bit of worth they will have you doing some more interesting stuff most places when leveraging experience will hire without certs but not always experience is greater than certs earlier in your career but as you grow you will get more pushback about lack of certs especially without college i grabbed the comptia trifecta after hitting this point myself and wouldnt be in the position i am in now without it as you start to specialize certs start to become required cisco is probably the biggest example of this in my experience you can be the best network tech in the world but there are some cisco environments that wont even look at you without your certs imo comptia trifecta where you want to go whether its cloud server virtualization networking etc you do not want to miss out on that 80k a year position because of something silly like certs if you know it the tests are easy and they pay for themselves you may have a different experience but this has been mine about 10 years in wanted to add learning frameworks like itil mof iso etc early at least getting your feet wet will help you a ton later in your career as well especially if your going sysadmin route ,3,CompTIA

Juten,and to the very article you linked the last concluding paragraph finally as i mentioned before i went into this review with a bias toward the hyper 212 evo and frankly it delivered the price performance ratio of cooler master hyper 212 coolers is essentially bulletproof and speaks to the same type of user who overclocked not to hit records but to get the most out of his or her limited investment a build using a hyper 212 evo and an antec gx700 enclosure for example may not be the most attractive system in the world but it will get a tremendous amount of mileage out of the buyer money because the cooler master hyper 212 evo is able to produce fairly competitive thermals without too much noise pollution i am happy to award it a bronze editor choice award im not saying the h100i isnt better i said the cost to benefit isnt worth it i personally only got about 2 degree difference on my fx 8350 but reading the maximumpc article i linked they said something about a firmware update they had to do to get it working correctly ,2,buildapc
Juten,the article i linked showed at load h100i 61 degrees 212 evo 67 3 this was on a core i7 3960 overclocked at 4 1 ghz ,1,buildapc
Juten,no sli option no raid pcie 2 0 no overclocking you go for the z87 gtx 770 and the 4670k you can a year or so down the road pick up another 770 for cheap and give you a boost in graphics and overclock the cpu to keep your machine relevant for longer thats what you sacrifice for your 100 dollars again for super budget build your right but hes got 1000 bucks to spend make it count edit also cheapest h85 mobo on newegg is 50 bucks cheapest z87 is 90 that with the 20 dollar difference of the cpu is a 60 dollar difference ,7,buildapc

Juten,http www maximumpc com corsair h100i cpu cooler review while 6 degrees under load is a good difference the 20 to 110 dollar comparison makes it not worth it in my opinion also the h100i is way louder than the hyper 212 ,2,buildapc
Juten,is a 20 dollar difference not exactly lots of money,-4,buildapc
Juten,im gonna put it like this i had the hyper 212 for my fx 8350 and bought the h100i cause i got a deal the temp difference was maybe 1 2 degrees difference if that dont waste your money on the water cooling the i5 is a much cooler running processor than my fx 8350 get the hyper 212,1,buildapc
Juten,i would say get the 4670k instead of the 4670 even if you dont plan on overclocking now when it starts to get end of life you can get some extra performance if you get the 4670 you save like 20 dollars now and limit yourself in the future ,0,buildapc
Juten,dont be crazy and get anything over 1600mhz some people will tell you to get the crazy oc memory but for as far as gaming goes memory really is not the bottleneck unless you have integrated graphics also most processors including the one you got cant use anything past 1600mhz maybe up to 1866 ,1,buildapc
Juten,get the hyper 212 for the cooler its the same design but cheaper you can find it as cheap as 15 20 bucks with fan i really dont trust sandisk for the ssd my opinion consult http www harddrivebenchmark net high end drives html to check the highest speeds i believe the samsung evo ssd are some of the best right now i did a quick search for sandisk on that page and the top was is pretty far down the list in terms of performance be careful buying cheap power supplies like the one you picked they can sometimes be very reliable but usually are loud as hell never skimp on the power supply edit also dont be like a lot of people and buy a awesome video card and then get a piece of crap monitor my current favorite are the korean ips panels like the catleap i have the ds270 its 27 1440p monitor you can find on ebay for 300 spend the extra 20 30 bucks to make sure you get the perfect pixel version and you couldnt be happier for the price if you got cash to burn get the 120hz version ,2,buildapc

Juten,as someone who owns the fx8350 go for the i5 some games just dont do as well on the 8350 as the i5 if your already shopping at microcenter you can usually get a real good deal on a i5 and i7 you really dont need an i7 but if its cheap enough why not great choice on the heatsink i had one and upgraded to a h100i cause i got a deal on it and only saw a degree or two difference ,2,buildapc
Juten,i have a fx8350 overclocked to 4 6 with a gtx 770 and plugged into my killawatt under load the max ive seen it get up to is 500watts amd is way more power hungry than the intel there is no way its his power supply unless its malfunctioning as far as the multiplier goes your right i was thinking of the fsb ,1,techsupport
Juten,im not positive on any of this but heres my thought cranking up the multiplier increases the frequency on everything including the pci bus i believe on some motherboards there is some kind of option to uncouple or whatever its called the cpu multiplier from the pci bus and if you have that option you should do that you dont need to overclock the pci bus at all because there is more than enough bandwidth on it for the best graphics cards out there i havent done a overclock in over a year so im a bit fuzzy but i would start somewhere around there edit wanted to had that your 650watt powersupply is more than enough for that setup its not a power issue i think it has to do with that increased pci frequency from the increased multiplier ,1,techsupport
