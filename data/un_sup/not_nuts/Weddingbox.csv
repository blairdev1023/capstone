Weddingbox,funny you mention crushing national debt the tories economic policy has put us on a course to accumulate more national debt than has ever been accumulated by all previous labour governments combined so your answer to the facts of how terribly unbalanced unequal and unsustainable the uk economy is is that unemployment is low due to the gig economy and zero hours contacts or that desperate refugees from africa and the middle east are trying to get here illegally you will pardon me if i think a g7 country should have higher standards especially when waxing lyrically about rock solid economic policies that have been proven conceptually and demonstrably to be sub optimal edit ah you are a septic who has fuck all clue what you are talking about fucking magic ,1,todayilearned

Weddingbox, scottish people knew that there was a possibility of brexit utter nonsense a common no platform was the only way to stay in the eu is to vote no at the time cameron had allowed a scottish referendum he had only verbally indicated no manifestos for the 2015 election had yet been released that he would hold an eu referendum if reelected so you are saying the scottish electorate should have predicted that a cameron would follow through on a verbal indication to include an eu referendum in the tory manifesto b the tories would win the 2015 election c the eu referendum would be structured to be legally advisory and therefore not require a super majority or simple majority of the constituent nations and d that referendum would result in a narrow leave verdict i am sorry we did not anticipate this in 2014 for your constitutional convenience ,4,todayilearned

Weddingbox,i do not agree when modern people experience fiction they presume there meaning there without it being grounded in historical events parables and myths taken direct from the bronze age just do not click with modern people anymore i also think people want at least a sense of agency in developing an understanding of their own motivations and those of others if ethical questions can have different right answers then i want to be the final arbiter not another adult who offers their own self awarded institutional authority above a reasoned argument i am not bothered whether the story teller believes in the historical accuracy of the story i am concerned that what is happening is closer to uploading an already structured set of morals instead of providing fertile ground for individuals to explore morality using their own reasoning and experiences maybe i am different but i want to be convinced via a reasoned argument evidence or my own contemplation of how to answer ethical questions not just accept a message in a parable at face value ,2,nottheonion

Weddingbox,well the common answer is that in europe it was known that people travelled on the left of the road theory being your fighting hand is closer to an oncoming enemy it then goes that napoleon changed this and having conquered most of continental europe that system stuck there however this is just the story i have seen and i am not prepared to back this up it would seem that if countries developed their own automotive industries they made vehicles that would handle their existing road side preference safely once these industries were sufficiently developed the rules became cemented if your nation depended on vehicle imports seems you would adapt your roads to suit the cheapest most common imports and often these would come from your close neighbours and where sharing a land border this would add extra impetus other times these imports would percolate from the wealthy classes of imperial expats see africa however i am just speculating the rarity of switching examples points to inertia and cost benefit ,1,explainlikeimfive
Weddingbox,the simple answer is cost vs benefit the costs of any one country switching would be extremely high in any developed country imagine redesigning and rebuilding the entire entry and exit roads for a highway motorway system alone the benefits are miniscule and difficult to cost in fact ireland after converting their road signage from miles to kms asked themselves this very question and they could not find a good reason to switch sweden switched in 1967 but that was because their cars were almost all lhd but they were driving on the left this is obviously a dangerous situation so their choice was replace every car and truck in sweden or switch sides at the time the state of the road network meant it was easier to adjust the system than adjust the vehicle ownership of the population samoa changed as recently as 2009 from driving on the right to driving on the left they did this to reduce their reliance on lhd cars from america in favour of cheaper australian rhd imports myanmar did the opposite of sweden they changed to right side driving despite having rhd cars this made the driving less safe but the ruler at the time just wanted to do this and no one really knows why these examples illustrate that the circumstances to provoke such a change are unusual and should definite benefits to justify the high cost or just a wacky south east asian dictator ,2,explainlikeimfive
Weddingbox,actually nothing about this is clearly objective ie whether we are able to clearly judge whether one side is better than the other additionally as most people are right eye dominant it is suggested that rhd is safer as the dominant eye is more easily focused on oncoming traffic trying to compare safety records of countries with rhd vs lhd is extremely problematic given the number of variables at play road development complexity speeds vehicle types quality population density road density road policing philosophies driver ages road usage by bicycles pedestrians etc etc if you compare two countries for road safety records you will only likely show the relative merits of one countries complete road and driving system rather than being able to make conclusions about a very specific characteristic additionally this does not answer the question asked which was why do not we all switch to one side or the other even if one side was objectively safer the question would remain why has not the unsafe side switched ,1,explainlikeimfive

Weddingbox,have you even read their manifesto in this section all what you mention is already illegal and isps already block this material so why bother with further internet regulation safe space for terrorists to be able to communicate online if you think this means anything other than putting backdoors into encryption you are just blissfully naive if you think it a good idea and wo not increase the risks of hacking and identity theft i also encourage you to seek the advice of any technologically minded person if you think this would be an effective method against terrorism listen to what security experts are telling us if you think there no chance of this being abused i feel sorry for you take steps to protect the reliability and objectivity of information that is essential to our democracy yeah it important that the tory party is put in charge of what is and is not the truth almost like a ministry of truth put a responsibility on industry not to direct users even unintentionally to hate speech pornography or other sources of harm yes i am sure this wo not get abused at all i am glad i have the government to prevent me from all those scary internets like those dangerous sites which point out theresa lies or her dementia tax or her unwillingness to hold an enquiry into orgreave so thankful to our supreme leader for protecting us from these obviously harmful lies honestly if you do not see this as a slippery slope towards controlling the information we have access to then i feel sorry for you reddit as it displays pornographic content would be banned until you can prove your age or even banned completely for not having the right anti abuse or identity mechanisms in place i mean how can you tell that probably the most frightening thing it all so vague she can introduce must about anything she wants and could justify it by this manifesto if you do not see this as a blank cheque for controlling the internet how do you explain it taking into consideration the ip act and the digital economy act both of which are indicative of may government ,3,worldnews

Weddingbox,i would not get too optimistic the two most prominent occasions where may has undertaken a damaging material policy u turn have been the result of criticism from the daily mail ni contributions reversal and now the dementia tax her other notable u turns remain to brexit employees on company boards logging foreign workers brits abroad getting to vote calling a general election did not really have the same toxicity especially with regards to the papers furthermore there has been no notable press on her scary dictatorial promise to regulate and censor the internet seriously where is the public outcry what she struggling with is how to continue to cut corp taxes and face the immense fiscal challenge brexit will bring without explicitly demolishing the welfare state and or angering her core voters cutting things pensioners rely on or increasing personal taxes she painted herself into a corner and i do not think anyone knows how it possible to pursue brexit tory small state conservatism while retaining the policies and institutions beloved by the people you need to vote for you frankly i do not think there anyone in the civil service or among economists who think there any way to pursue hard brexit without causing serious damage to the economy for at least the medium term their strategy seems to be based on rhetoric misleading the public that they can have brexit without any negative ramifications particularly to pensioners and the working class and berating the hell out of corbyn her political style is not keeping her with a lot of allies despite having kept the party together until now this reality of her intractable position is beginning to bite and about bloody time but i do not know if there enough time for corbyn to turn the tide she had a year of almost universal praise and he had two years of serious attacks labour certainly are doing well by avoiding a focus on brexit during this campaign but they face the same challenge if you want brexit to mean strictly controlling eu migration this will damage the economy for a number of reasons i think we wo not really feel this until 2019 so what happens when you need to ask people do you want to control eu migration or do you want to keep the nhs as it is and your living standards above eastern european levels the tories say they will not give us this choice they will decide for us and they will decide for brexit the lib dems have said they will give us this choice do we know what labour would do ,13,worldnews

Weddingbox, eu does a lot of trade with us so they will be inclined to bash out a quick and good trade deal for us this idea is well and truly rubbished by now even the eu negotiators themselves have been surprised at the unity of the position that the eu 27 have come to preserving the political and economic union of the eu is more important than giving the uk a beneficial trade deal those german carmakers who were supposed to help us persuade germany yeah they are firmly committed to eu unity above pushing for a trade deal for us the eu have said they will allow a maximum 3 year window to negotiate a trade deal while we are under interim arrangements so we do not crash out in march 2019 this assumes may and company will be happy to accept whatever the conditions of these interim arrangements are will certainly include supremacy of ecj and likely free movement with may trying to get reelected under these conditions this also assumes the exiting negotiations do not go tits up even after these assumptions can you tell me how many comprehensive free trade deals the eu has struck in a 3 year negotiating window i will save you the time the answer is none efta no one in government has suggested joining efta but not the eea like switzerland may has stated she does not want an off the shelf option ie joining efta norway has publicly expressed concerns about letting the uk into efta because it would represent a dramatic shift in the power dynamics of the organisation can we put this to bed now as for not striking deals with the us perhaps you have missed the fact that the civil service has been told that all existing regulation takes second place to the priority of securing trade deals trade and growth are now priorities in all posts according to senior civil servant tim hitchens you may also forget the biggest proponents of ttip within the eu were the uk government even with a comprehensive free trade agreement with the eu the uk will be desperate for any trade deals they can herald as progress in trade the us is a big sexy win in this column as much as the uk gov can harmonise read acquiesce to us regulations without breaking any trade commitments with the eu they will i admire your optimism but you will pardon me if i do not share it ,2,videos
Weddingbox,i am not arguing that the above is the correct course of action i am simply summarising what i see as the leanings of lawmakers and politics at the moment the argument of practicality would not be a good one in the face of accusations that they are acting as media companies they would need to argue that they are not ie that they are more like phone companies than online newspapers if these companies are classed as media then either they find a way to meet the standards of the law as media companies or change their business models which is sort of my point ,1,AskReddit
Weddingbox,youtube google and facebook in particular are in for a reckoning with the law in various jurisdictions in my opinion specifically laws of publishing while youtube cannot handle copyright issues properly facebook cannot seem to get a handle on inappropriate and or illegal content they say they are just forums for information posted by users they just host the information via their pipes it starting to become clear that they need to have an ever active role in policing content second they have direct yet passive influence over the reach of certain content algorithms that push specific content to users depending on user characteristics third they generate ad revenue by hosting popular content how far away are these sites getting from a sort of giant magazine filled with crowd sourced stories and content if they get classed as media instead of just pipes like phone companies their legal obligations change materially they would be liable for copyright infringement distribution of cp libel etc this would probably not be good for our internet version of free speech however they have many powerful enemies germany and the eu are relentlessly going after google under one pretext or another the uk government sees google twitter and facebook as standing in the way of their characteristic and draconian assaults on privacy the us media companies would love to knock down these upstarts a peg or two i think we will look back to the days of the wild west of the internet with fondness one day ,114,AskReddit

Weddingbox,eh none of that is true a bus driver does not have to accept anything unless he trying to reclaim a debt he owed in which case if he in england or wales he must accept bank of england notes or coins if he in scotland he can refuse anything apart from coins not sure about northern ireland but i think it the same as scotland however if you try to buy a bus journey before you take the journey this is not a debt transaction and the concept of legal tender has nothing to do with it ,13,britishproblems
Weddingbox,legal tender has a very specific meaning technically a shop can refuse to accept any money you try to give them if you owe a debt your creditor cannot refuse payment in the form of legal tender so any non debt transaction does not involve the concept of legal tender source scottish person who is obliged to know what legal tender does and does not mean ,37,britishproblems

Weddingbox,it using a consultation which paradoxically is only presented to those who could implement the policy isps not industry experts or the public which is the entire purpose of consultations anyone who votes for theresa may votes for this type of stuff strong and stable leadership means authoritarianism and any opposition branded as saboteurs or enemies of the people for evidence please see the investigatory powers act which means any government department can access your internet domain name history without a warrant or the digital economy act which means a government regulator likely to be the bbfc roughly equivalent to the mpaa will force isps to block porn sites that either do not force users to prove their age with credit card details official id or show extreme pornography which under current bbfc rules includes bondage and face sitting anyone in the uk considering voting tory because you want to leave the eu i respect your views on that issue but please realise you are voting for a party that has demonstrated their desire to control censor and monitor your internet activities please be warned ,24,worldnews

Weddingbox,i have got to respect your considered post but the idea that demographic changes alone are responsible for the dismissal of labour is a bit cheap the youth vote has deteriorated materially since 97 it not simply demographics but young voter apathy however that point aside and for better or worse personality politics are the name of the game now this was once the more exclusive territory of presidential systems see nixon vs jfk in the us in the 60s but it now infected politics worldwide no matter their democratic systems in an fptp system people do not vote according to which the policies they most agree with they vote for one of the only two viable party leaders in their constituency that they hate the least the issue is that people just do not like corbyn it that simple yes tory policies are horrible but most people just do not pay much attention to policies anymore and fptp is largely why they vote for leaders who seem strong and confident and have nice sounding consistent soundbites corbyn just does not have these may does trust me i hate may and her ever totalitarian rhetoric and would rather vote to have a lobotomy than for her party of certified unicorn fluffers but corbyn and his form of wet blanket opposition is the only reason people are not voting labour in droves he also infuriating because he knows this and stubbornly refuses to resign even though it obvious he destroying the party ,2,glasgow
Weddingbox,ah good stuff for me the continuous review of committees and the other often overlooked details of government that occurs fairly regularly in scottish parliament is great i believe there a current review into improving the committees further as well as the regional lists for the d hondt system this focus on improvement and reform in the interests of better democracy is what for me stands apart from westminster which is so obstinately opposed to change of parliamentary proceedings plus the fact that the early coalitions took the scottish land rights which were still based on the feudal system and transformed them into some of the most liberal land access laws in the world will be something our grandchildren will be proud of edit i agree that recently it become more confrontational especially as majority or near majority governments have been in place and the consequent fact that it become a shouting forum about independence on both sides if only it could go back to coalitions and have greater powers that the smith commission promised and never fully delivered imagine a faroe islands type devolution eh that would have been a great compromise to the independence question before brexit cocked it all up ,2,glasgow
Weddingbox, not sure if sarcastic but the scottish parliament only operated under a formal coalition from its inception until 2007 those were pre voting years for me and also the infancy of the parliament so i do not have much memory of their achievements or shortcomings however if you are being sarcastic i would be honestly interested to hear your thoughts about its functioning and whether it a testament or criticism of coalition government in hindsight while it destroyed the lib dems the uk coalition government was essentially tory policy tempered down and what we are seeing now is full blown tory madness based on this and the bounty of other coalition governments from elsewhere in europe i stand by my point that compromise is a natural and desirable side effect ,1,glasgow
Weddingbox,one of biggest reasons why fptp is a terrible form of democracy because of stv for council elections in scotland all but 2 councils are non majority while in england and wales almost every authority is majority dominated edit i am not saying this is objectively the best way for our various levels of government to function but in my opinion it is the best way for governments to function in a parliamentary style system ,6,glasgow

Weddingbox,actually mate you are half right do not listen to these posters who are not quite up to date the recently passed digital economy act now allows the british board of film classification ie the gov org who put age designations on films and video games to ban porn websites by forcing isps to block them that do not require users to prove their age and identity via credit card info or official id furthermore if the bbfc deems the porm content to be extreme which includes inter alia bondage and face sitting then they can just ban the site regardless of age verification systems or not so it more correct to say the uk will ban all pornography unless you identify yourself and will ban any pornography it deems inappropriate google the digital economy act and try not to laugh yourself silly ,8,worldnews

Weddingbox,i am quite certain the reason they are doing this is because other services which can sometimes seem to be competitors collect plus dhp boxes amazon boxes have little to no staff costs and very minimal premises rental costs while they have full shops with numerous staff they are essentially moving to the same collect plus model which is why their locations run out of morrisons or news agents are not closing this is stupid though because the original ethos was to have delivery points at or near train stations meaning folk could pick up their parcels without deviating from their normal daily commute news agents in central locations have much less real estate to allow significant volumes and they will not be as quick nor convenient larger venues and large supermarkets wo not be located in city centre commute routes ie near main real hubs i do not have access to company data so anything i say is pure speculation but my hypothesis is that doddle are leaving a market for which there was no real competition delivery points at stations in high density areas to enter a market with competition delivery points outside central areas operated by third parties and they uniquely charge the end user on receipt additionally news agents will be able to up their rental prices as more services compete to host parcel services from their shop with finite space also you will now have 2 distinct parties between you and your seller doddle and the news agent supermarket which can do nothing but deteriorate customer services i predict this will end badly for them i for one wo not use them anymore edit just had a glance at their financial statements on companies house staff costs are like half their costs so an easy target additionally network rail used to own half the business but divested over a year ago i think that a significant point for why their rail station shops are being axed probably an interesting story behind this ,3,glasgow
Weddingbox,you have been given great info and advice from others here about the location and bars music etc i will just add my advice regarding taxis since you mentioned you can walk or get the subway to pretty much every central location merchant city city centre west end however if you cannot be bothered walking at some point or say you are in the west end after the subway closes at night taxis in glasgow are very affordable black cabs are the common pick up taxis you will recognise them and these are the ones you can just flag down if they have their light on the drivers will always have extensive knowledge of the city and will know where you are trying to go to i cannot see a taxi from the west end to merchant city being more than 10 they can take card payments but it can be a bit of a fiddling experience cash is best there is an app called gett where you can register your card and then order a black cab and the payment goes through directly just like uber not sure if it will work for foreign cards but worth looking in to alternatively you can book a private hire taxi by phoning them either book a specific time in advance or ask for one immediately these are cheaper than black cabs the drivers are usually just as knowledgeable the two largest companies are network and hampden so have a google to get their phone numbers if this is something you think you may need best to have cash for these ones they both have their own apps you can use to book instead of phoning but you still need to pay with cash tipping i think you should tip both black cab and private hire folk round up to nearest if a very small fare but i usually try to give at least 1 uber they only started operating in glasgow a year or two ago and they have not really gone down that well they are almost always surge pricing at busy times ie weekends nights and thus are as much or even more expensive than black cabs additionally i have never found them to be that knowledgeable and have had to help direct them to my destination yes even with sat nav this is my opinion based on my and my friends experiences others may disagree here so it might just be hit or miss like i said you probably do not need a taxi but it worth knowing about them in case you do hope you have a great time here tl dr i would just get a black cab if you need a taxi same in edinburgh use gett app if you do not want to deal with cash tip a quid be sure to chat with the driver you are foreign so more interesting tell them what you have been up to ask them about glasgow you will struggle to understand the accent it will be fun ,3,glasgow

Weddingbox,a the circumstances of that vote have been materially alerted hence perfectly reasonable to think the question needs to be re adressed in light of this change b never claimed the greens specified they would call a referendum in the same circumstances they make it clear in their manifesto that they support independence c like it or lump it scottish parliament has voted to request a referendum why would this be surprising when a majority of msps are for it there is categorically a majority support in parliament for the legislation because it passed d we know the entry requirements we know spain wo not veto we know many eu politicians have publicly stated that because scotland is already compliant it would be pretty straightforward that about as much as you can know for the future again claiming you need to know the future relationship before the vote is hypocritical consolidering the eu referendum furthermore who is the adjudicator on what needs to be known you the pm there no tick box list for when you can or cannot hold a referendum e the case for whether to have a referendum is different than what you believe the outcome of the referendum should be you are begging the question by saying we should not have one because you think your side is right why ever have a referendum on anything ever ,0,worldnews
Weddingbox,a yep one in which we were told the only way to stay in the eu would be to vote no the circumstances have materially changed b the snp explicitly have a mandate for this have you read their manifesto the greens are pro independence the majority of msps are for independence mandate met c according to polls yes does not stop the fact that we voted more msps into power who favour independence than who do not again there a political mandate in parliament let see what a national poll would say you know like in a referendum d i we will know this within the timetable proposed by both may and sturgeon ii so we need to know the future relationship before voting for it funny how we voted in an eu referendum without knowing this additionally this is beside the point the whole point is that the people of scotland should be given the option to choose our own relationship with europe rather than leave it up to the lunatic fringe of the tory party e this has nothing to do with the question of whether to have a referendum or not you are starting the independence debate despite claiming it should not be had just now ,0,worldnews
Weddingbox,regardless of the outcome of the ge in scotland the snp with the help of the greens in the scottish parliament will withhold the legislative consent motion required for the great repeal bill that the pm will need unless they get their request for a referendum this ge will be an attempt by the pm to take the sting out of this argument if the tories can reduce the snps stronghold in westminster but it wo not matter ultimately as it is not scotlands mps in westminster who ask for a referendum nor are they responsible for delivering legislative consent motions additionally sturgeon now knows may will u turn at the slightest breeze ,1,worldnews
Weddingbox,ignoring the political chances of a party winning power with the policy of reversing brexit technically it is feasible the eu have explicitly said the uk can revoke their declaration and halt the process but it would need to be done in a way approved of by the eu whatever that means but the eu have explicitly left this door open to the uk ,2,worldnews
Weddingbox,because having mps in parliament does not automatically make them fit to stay in those seats in perpetuity frankly if what we have in the house today are qualified mps i will take unqualified mps every day of the week and twice on sundays i oppose a hard brexit so that means no tories of labour and the lib dems i prefer the policies of the lib dems to those of labour simple as that ,5,worldnews

Weddingbox,i would like other comments really like to see you back this view up with either real world examples or academic research the best bus services in the country are undeniably edinburgh and london both of which are publicly owned what follows is a long past where i describe why for many reasons increased bus competition wo not deliver value for money to the taxpayer nor a better service economically speaking public transportation does not lend itself to optimal free market outcomes because perfect competion does not exist when you have shared and limited infrastructure rail or road furthermore bus services are meant to be as non exclusive as possible non exclusive goods are not optimally delivered by natural market forces in most cases eg parks roads healthcare on top of these theoretical economic issues the public already subsidise private bus companies who then are allowed to raise prices faster than inflation and cut their least profitable routes and then make a tidy profit for themselves at the end i need to elaborate on this because it truly despicable so everyone already gives these companies money through taxes they are free to stop operating loss making routes which are then picked up by spt which means more public money subsidising their non service then after all this they get to pay dividends and tidy executive pay packages there is no way you cannot describe this as fleecing the public at large and the poorest in our society who have no other transport choice i have left out the part about price increases to illustrate that more competition among bus services would not solve any of the above problems even without above inflation price increases this private public service model is just not for for purpose in any way it makes us all worse off unless you are an executive or shareholder of one of these horrible companies 1st year economic students could opine that increased competion would force suppliers to provide competitive prices but this does not work for buses at all first people have no material choice if i need to get to work at a certain time everyday i cannot just choose which bus would be cheaper i need to choose one based on the timetable maybe you would have multiple companies on the same or similar timetables now one bus load of people on a route at a particular time that may have been profitable for one company to transport are split among many buses making none of these buses profitable will they get more subsidies this also ignores the problems of increased congestion with more less full buses on the road then you only have to look at energy companies to suspect that these bus companies would raise their prices together if your idea of competition here is not multiple services on the same routes maybe it putting individual routes or areas out to tender everyone in the uk has seen how helping companies make exploitative profits running a public service through a complex tendering process which guarantees the taxpayer will subsidise the private company leads to abysmal service no accountability and increased costs for all their performance targets are weak or have no real enforcement mechanism the contract drafting tendering process bid evaluation monitoring and final hand off are insanely expensive requiring paid professionals and industry experts and all of this is paid for by the taxpayer say a publicly owned and operated transport service has x running costs how much efficiency savings e have to be delivered to these running costs such that the complex tender process t executive pay p and shareholder returns r do not cost more x e t p r surely paying x is cheaper simpler and means those who run the service are directly accountable to the taxpayer ie those who finance the service whether public or private what we have now is elusively expensive these companies purposefully hide how profitable their services are in specific areas extremely complex does anyone understand the tender process and the service operators are only legally and professionally accountable to their shareholders so in light of not only these theoretical objections but the patently obvious failure of the privatisation of transport services to deliver value for money as promised by your party since the 80s why do you think more private bus operators or a more complex tendering process in glasgow would deliver what has never been delivered before or novel idea publicly fund and operate the buses like they do in edinburgh and london respect for coming here to discuss your candidacy with us i appreciate you may not have time to answer this or i may be too late so i would be happy to hear anyone with counter arguments or who could argue his position as a proxy ,9,glasgow

Weddingbox,you can get taken to court is all i am saying however i can see now that other things i have said in my replies was actually incorrect eg it not correct that you have to prove you are not the driver the claimant has to prove you are the driver would you rather i delete these so as not to spread false info or that i keep them up for my shame it seems that if you ignore everything and do not respond in any way they may desperately try to take you to court where they will need to prove you are the driver or the case will be thrown out you may have to hire a solicitor and may get expenses awarded if it dismissed or you win is this a fair summary ,2,glasgow
Weddingbox,i am not saying you wo not win a court case if the claimant cannot prove you were the driver but they can take you to court where you would have to argue this also here an example where a case went to court and the sheriff ruled the ppc had not identified the keeper as the driver https www pressreader com uk the courier advertiser perth and perthshire edition 20150616 282351153406399 this proves my point that you can get taken to court without them having to definitively prove you are the driver beforehand but if they cannot prove it you will win the case ,2,glasgow
Weddingbox,so how are people taken to court for this then we are arguing this this same point across many places here shall we stick to this particular thread ,2,glasgow
Weddingbox,it may provide reasonable grounds for identifying the driver sufficient that a court will allow the case to be argued please explain how this is ever taken to court otherwise ,2,glasgow
Weddingbox, how do you explain people having been taken to court for this if you believe they need to 100 prove who was driving before the court case begins i do not understand what you are trying to tell people here that they will never be taken to court ,1,glasgow
Weddingbox,do not listen to this guy about them needing to prove you were driving to take you to court they just need to provide sufficient facts to the court to allow the claimant to take the case forward anyone who says you will never be taken to court for private parking violations in scotland is demonstrably incorrect trust the citizens advice scotland over anything posted by randoms online ,3,glasgow
Weddingbox,on the basis that they provide a claim form to the sheriff court stating the factual background to the dispute and the court allowing the claim to proceed to a court date people are taken to court and forced to pay unpaid parking charges in scotland it usually not done unless you owe a lot but do not tell people it not possible because it very much is ,2,glasgow
Weddingbox,because if someone sues you for breach of contract you need to provide evidence you did not breach the contract or you will lose that civil suit if you are suggesting they can only take you to court if they can 100 prove you were driving and breached the contract what would the point of the court be the requirements to bring something to court are less than the requirements to win the suit ,2,glasgow
Weddingbox,no but it can provide them with reasonable enough evidence to take it to court there you will have to prove you were not driving they do not have to have already proven you were driving in order to take you to court ,1,glasgow
Weddingbox,you the vehicle owner will be taken to court and then asked to prove you did not violate the contract one way would be for you to prove that you were not driving and did not park it remember in a civil suit you have the burden of proof to challenge their claim feel free to miss a court summons and see how that goes for you though ,3,glasgow
Weddingbox,you are actually not wrong but there is something they can do which would make your life difficult they can take you to court for violating the contract you had with the parking operator the fixed penalty notice they send you is really just an amount they are willing to settle for out of court and in the civil court the burden would be on you to challenge their claim there are legitimate grounds for you to use for this but dealing with the courts at this point would be a pain and they would be baying for blood if it got this far they are highly unlikely to take you to court for single infractions and relatively small amounts of money but they always can try and then you would have to deal with a civil suit against you the reason that woman got hit with the 25k is that she was a repeat offender at that parking area it became worth it for the operators to take her to court and they could prove she was the driver https www citizensadvice org uk scotland law and courts parking tickets appealing parking tickets parking tickets on private land s edit it seems that if you ignore them and never respond to anything they send you they can still desperately take you to court but they have to prove you were the driver ,2,glasgow

Weddingbox,my one complaint about such systems is getting the card can be expensive or off putting for tourists i think an app that shows your ticket is a more tourist friendly solution saying that having one card that works across all transport across the entire country is an absolutely brilliant idea that i am surprised more countries have not pursued ,1,The_City
Weddingbox,this true whether independent or not the most straightforward solution is to attract lots of immigration an option closed off by u k policy hence many people believe scotland should govern itself ,4,worldnews
Weddingbox,care to actually respond to his argument though i have not read many believable critiques of gers figures but this is a new and interesting argument i wonder how it can be explained ,5,worldnews
Weddingbox,which is why we will start to see policy shift towards efta and eea membership which crucially do not have the same strict entry requirements and importantly does not involve a customs union which means any barriers to trade would for england to impose rather than something scotland would be obligated to enforce like ireland will have to with northern ireland ,2,worldnews
Weddingbox,true but the snp are asking for the referendum on a timeline that the tories and the eu have publicly stated they will know what the deal is no one is suggesting scotland should vote without knowing the deal the tories are arguing against something which is not proposed and mundell is trying to say it should not be held until the whole process is complete transitional arrangements and all so 28 national governments can vote on scotland future but neither the parliament nor the people of scotland can yep sounds about right ,7,worldnews
Weddingbox,eh the argument to hold the referendum is because scotland voted a party into power who in their manifesto promised to seek to hold a referendum if one of two things happened one of those has happened it as simple as that additionally everyone has accepted scotland is leaving the eu and will have to apply the reason snp want it as soon as possible because they do not want legal and regulatory incompatibility to be an additional challenge to a membership bid which is almost certain to happen given the noises the tories are making about cutting regulations the longer scotland operates under regulations that are incompatible with eu membership the more difficult it is to change them and adds a barrier to joining that does not currently exist ,5,worldnews
Weddingbox,he ignorant of the fact that there are different versions of spelling among the different dialects of english despite the language being named after another country namely the country of its inception instead of using the computer to do a quick check to see whether the word jewellery is the spelling convention of a different english dialect to the one he knows he thought he was correcting someone spelling with a reddit comment hence an idiot ,5,funny

Weddingbox,actually if you are planning on just always paying your balance in full you might as well shop around for a card which benefits you eg i have got a credit card for the sole purpose of travelling abroad its got a high apr who cares but does not have any fx fees at all even for cash withdrawals you just may find a card that rewards your circumstances do you have moneysupermarket or comparethemarket or gocompare or similar comparison sites where you are they usually provide good overviews of which cards suit which lifestyles ,2,explainlikeimfive

Weddingbox,yes but implying the only reason is taxes is not correct though i am not sure corporate finance lends itself to be explained to 5 year olds it often purposefully designed to be complicated ,1,explainlikeimfive
Weddingbox,well it not simply taxes though it also a debate within the theory of finance namely if investors are capable of diversifying their portfolios on their own and in most markets they are investors would rather that money which could pay a dividend be reinvested into the company this assumes that the investor would invest any dividend cash into the market and not depend on dividend cash flows for their income additionally cash is the cheapest form of finance so if i am running the finance department i am going to want to avoid just giving out a bunch of cash to my investors especially when they already trust me to make efficient use of the cash they have already given me on the other hand investment funds or investors who want to generate a steady stream of income without exclusively buying bonds will find dividend paying company stock much more attractive than having to constantly flip holdings in order to generate income from capital gains companies who pay dividends like to keep the payout ratio stable and income focused funds appreciate this as they would struggle to replicate this reliability through capital gains ,4,explainlikeimfive

Weddingbox,you appear to be fairly correct i googled this after posting call me lazy because you need to have a mortgage in principle and have the bank be made aware of the price you are bidding before you can even submit an offer it seems there would be no way they would agree to lend you money dependent on a sale of your existing property also the fact that it all done through a solicitor on each side of the transaction means they are professionally obligated to ensure you can follow up on your offer before the deal is concluded it also seems that once your offer is accepted there are few options to crash out of the deal without paying a penalty apparently chains do happen here but they are not that common and they usually do not collapse because of the above mentioned reasons the downside is that temporary accommodation between purchases appears to be an accepted thing very interesting i always wondered why location location location was so anti climactic when it featured scotland thanks ,2,britishproblems
Weddingbox,neither credit card debt nor car finance another hypothesised catastrophic bubble is securitised repackaged and aggressively sold to the same extent that mbs were not even close additionally the exponentially larger market that existed for complex derivatives based on mbs does not exist for credit card debt or car finance i am not saying there wo not be another bubble but credit card debt and car finance are not even remotely as ubiquitous as mbs and all related derivatives were in the world financial markets in years before 2008 ,277,AskReddit

Weddingbox,i would also add that it is useful to include the international country code for your number in case you lose it abroad while there a chance the finder wo not speak english they may see the phone number and make a reasonable inference of the message there almost no chance they will know the phone country of origin and therefore country code without which the phone number is useless sure an email address would solve this issue but the advantage of a phone number of a person close to you is that if something happens to you a responder or emergency person can call this contact right away not possible with your own email address ,1,LifeProTips

Weddingbox,i reckon with hmo student flats the tenancy agreement runs through term time but not summer months either way it fair to assume the same group may not want the flat next term with non student flats there no reason to assume the tenant s wo not renew after the length of the contract and there no term time to worry about unless the landlord or the tenants explicitly plan to not renew the contact and this is known well before the contact finishes why or how would a landlord know the flat would be available months in advance it does not seem like a common situation plus the way the market is even if they did know they would just wait until the contract is near end and advertise then not like they cannot sign within a few days ,1,glasgow

Weddingbox,the in some ways could be referring to this element of rhoticity which is true but there really no other evidence behind this idea i was not trying to come down on you i once believed this too but decided to look into it then realised there actually not much in it despite a lot of websites parroting the same message without actually providing reference to the studies which would otherwise back it up it one of these things where there is a kernel of truth in that we know there was a large shift in the rhoticity in england in the 19th century but we have taken that fact for a big ride to places where it should not go ,2,explainlikeimfive
Weddingbox,not true rhoticity was more common in 18th century britain than it is today american accents are rhotic that all you can say what you cannot say is that all rhotic accents sound more like other rhotic accents than they do to non rhotic accents because accents are made up of more than just rhoticity by this logic you would have to conclude that an edinburgh scottish accent sounds more similar to an east texas american accent than it does a carlisle english accent or that a georgian accent sounds more similar to kiwi accent than an belfast accent if you have ever heard any of these accents you would realise such a conclusion is absurd ,1,explainlikeimfive
Weddingbox,there really is not a source for what you are describing it an exaggerated fact perpetuated by qi and reddit the fact is this during the 18th century britain had many different accents that were characterised as rhotic ie hard r and they were widespread in use and variety during the 19th century the less ubiquitous non rhotic accent began to become more widespread especially in schools and eventually this more uniform non rhotic aspect became the more common accent variety than the previously dominant rhotic ones that the fact also a fact is that a standard feature of modern american accents is that they are rhotic with some exceptions these are the facts that get magically twisted into this assertion that modern american accents sound more similar to british ascents of the 18th century if rhoticity were the only defining characteristic of an accent then this myth with be true but because accents are highly complex and are distinguished by many features other than rhoticity then this is stretching the truth to the point of bullshit ,5,explainlikeimfive

Weddingbox, i am not sure how to avoid that situation well having three for profit agencies competing for customers who pay these agencies primary revenue source to give a fair assessment of the risks of their own products is probably the best way not to avoid that situation imagine the fda was one of three private companies you could pay to approve assess whether your medical products are safe for humans sounds insane and ripe for abuse does not it the only counter example i can think of is the auditing profession but even they struggle with the concept of independence see enron and changes to laws ever since plus there are arguments to be made that the auditors should shoulder some of the blame for 2008 as they clearly did not look closely enough at the evidentiary basis for the stated value of these assets when they were signing off their audits or their role is not too be expert financial modelers and are only there to provide a faithful representation but are not liable for this level of detail in which case what good is it to require audits in the first place if auditors cannot fulfil their raison d etre stopping companies from overstating their value to defraud investors ,1,explainlikeimfive

Weddingbox,wait what are you saying scots law does not share this quirk so it is not british it english ,1,explainlikeimfive
Weddingbox,i thought most libel law put the burden of proof on the complainant the person bringing the lawsuit to prove what the defamer said was untrue but you are right that the us and other countries have taken measures to ensure english law cannot be abused at home however if trump says something very stupid during his state visit to england then he fair game oh and just a correction it not british libel law this is exclusive to england maybe wales too everyone forgets about wales ,1,explainlikeimfive
Weddingbox,your general point about reviewing the exempt goods for their appropriateness i agree with but i do not see what is to be done about the specific issue you raise either increase taxes on healthy fresh food and so make this food further out of reach for the poorest or ease taxes on unhealthy food and only exacerbate the trend of ill health and obesity alternatively you could have some sort of official discount card accepted at all shops which you get if your income is below x threshold which gives you further discounts on healthy food or go to aldi for your fruit and veg like the rest of us because of how cheap it already is or tax ready meals higher if they have too much salt and sugar forcing the retailers to make their recipes healthier it definitely a problem worth consideration but also a tricky one ,13,todayilearned
Weddingbox,i mean we are arguing about a hypothetical that has not happened however my point was that english defamation laws put the burden of proof on the defamer to prove their claim true now a vague statement of fake news probably does not qualify on many different grounds however publicly accusing anyone news organisation or not of a specific lie or falsehood would be pretty hard to defend in england due to the burden of proof inversion i am mostly just joking but english libel law is no joke ,1,explainlikeimfive
Weddingbox,cannot wait for trumps state visit to the uk for this reason i would love to see our shit libel laws here put to good use for once if he says anything publicly here that defames a person and they decide to sue the burden of proof is on the accused defamer to prove what they said is true ,2,explainlikeimfive
Weddingbox,well it just the logical if highly technical conclusion of modern tax methodologies governments in the 19th century realised that their tax policies had material impacts on behaviour quite apart from simple tools to raise revenue they now had a way to alter behaviour and control the population so we realised that taxing unhealthy behaviour would see this behaviour reduced similarly we want to avoid taxing things that are necessities or would result in reduced desired behaviour hence the old window tax that resulted in increased rickets was gotten rid of based on this understanding we want to have a general value added tax on all goods however we do not want to increase the price on basic food necessities as we do not increase food poverty as much as possible ok so what are the basic foods that we want to be exempt from this tax well here a list so you did not include biscuits well they are sort of a luxury and you can easily survive without then ok but you included cake well fluffy moist bread products like cakes come in many forms and can form a part of a common diet hmm ok let go with this excuse me i am a biscuit and cake maker i believe you incorrectly classify one of my products as a biscuit and therefore my products are more expensive than they should be hmm i the tax authority disagree your product appears to be a biscuit to me you have an ulterior motive in just undercutting your competitors prices hmm well you too have an ulterior motive as you want to ensure as few goods as possible are exempt from this tax hmm good point shall we settle this like men heavens no i shall see you in court and i you and now this court case makes sense ,161,todayilearned

Weddingbox,you cannot have a soft border that controls the flow of goods and services that would be considered a hard border if there are border checks in northern ireland you can guarantee the troubles will be back it will tear up good friday so if you are prediction is true we have worse problems than brexit constitutionally ireland is obligated by the eu to enforce customs checks at any external border outside the customs union the only way to avoid this would be to remain in the customs union or for the eu to change their rules either solution would prove a model for scotland we will see ,1,worldnews

Weddingbox,ironically whatever solution the uk has to wrangle to avoid a hard border in northern ireland will just prove that a soft eu uk land border is possible the uk government can choose between reigniting the troubles in ni or prototyping the type of soft border that adds fuel to the independence argument i am not saying your arguments are not credible but in time with a soft border in northern ireland and if negative economic effects of brexit are felt more acutely in scotland the only strong political argument left is the currency as the brexit vote shows if people feel their economic situation cannot get much worse even though it absolutely can they can vote for anyone or anything ,3,worldnews

Weddingbox,i would argue that the elasticity of demand for flights is greater in europe for two simple reasons one train journeys offer competition on shorter routes as they avoid airport queues hassle and take you directly to city centres the us railway infrastructure focuses on freight so there little to no competition from trains in the us secondly paid time off the us does not have mandatory paid leave and it i think fair to say those who get the most holidays also tend to have the better paying jobs in europe everyone gets at least 5 weeks no matter what kind of job therefore european airlines are incentivised to compete to attract low wage workers who have more time for travel but wo not fly at all if it too expensive their counterparts in the us do not have the same time free or those who do have free time will tend to have higher incomes and therefore are not going to subject the industry to the same severity of price discrimination that just my take on the demand side i would love to see the percentage difference of business vs holiday numbers between eu and us i would hypothesise that the eu has a higher percentage of holiday traffic than the us which would support my explanation i believe ,2,explainlikeimfive

Weddingbox,can you outline any advantages for me you say we can have more trade deals with other nations and the eu as current members of the customs union we have a completely free trade deal with 27 other eu nations and trade deals with a further 50 nations upon leaving the customs union we will have precisely 0 trade deals how long will it take to negotiate 51 trade deals just to get us back to square one judging by the length of time such deals tend to take the answer is decades additionally as a market of 500m people and plenty of existing trade the eu has a very competitive negotiating position in any trade talks even still the us trade deal was looking pretty shit for many the uk is in a much worse bargaining position because it a smaller market and the desperation for quick trade deals is obvious to the world leaving the eu is not good for free trade deals unless you mean quick and dirty deals that are not to our advantage i acknowledge that the pm recently gave some waffle about how we want to leave but not leave the customs union i am not alone in being pretty baffled as to how that would work ,6,worldnews
Weddingbox,it takes more than a year to become an authorised firm in another country in the eu the banks are not moving for no reason that nonsense they are moving because they cannot wait to see if the deal continues to allow passporting because if it does not they wo not have the time to get setup elsewhere businesses need to have contingencies in place on case the deal is disadvantageous to them many would rather reduce risk now than wait until the deal is sealed when they would have limited time a few months to make adjustments it not for no reason it risk reduction in the face of uncertainty ,1,worldnews

Weddingbox,you need to understand just how integral the activities of london financial services are to the eu and the world london handles 3 4 of eu hedging activities 3 4 of eu foreign exchange activity 1 2 of eu lending activity and 1 2 of eu securities ie stocks bonds etc trading 40 of the entire world foreign exchange transactions are handled in london london has a higher volume of us dollar fx than new york now this position is not permanent and has been degraded from greater dominance in times past but you cannot just move that volume of activity to another country in two years it simply impossible similarly even a serious dent in this activity wo not come close to knocking london off the financial map however will there be an exodus of activity from london to elsewhere in the next two years yes how much tough to say there a lot of contingency planning and decision making that is currently taking place and the degree of any near term exodus will be evident when it happens within the next 2 years will london stop being the major global financial centre it currently is in 2 years almost certainly not in 10 years maybe a lot less important but who knows will this be damaging for the tech industry inevitably but it will take years to see to what extent the establishment of a tech innovation centre in the same place as a global financial centre is always an attractive place especially when this place attracts top global talent in two years it will almost certainly be less attractive than it was 6 months ago but i think it will take more time to properly shrink but really who knows right these are all just my opinions based on reading various news sources ,5,worldnews
Weddingbox,that not really how it works though you cannot engage in that kind of trade warfare with fellow members of a single market and customs union once the uk actually leaves at the end of the 2 year period then sure but they cannot do anything as drastic as you suggest when art 50 is triggered additionally the process of regulator approval in france germany ireland etc often takes longer than a year in normal circumstances and there are already reports of continental regulators inundated with applications which are already stretching processing times financial service companies wo not wait until the deal is sealed in 2019 because they simply do not have the time continental countries are competing with each other not the uk right now for the inevitable slice of fin services that will emigrate how big a slice remains to be seen however as many have pointed out just letting the uk drop out of the single market without any transition arrangements or special measures for financial services would have serious consequences for the eu and world economy because of the concentration of essential financial activities which take place in london fin services will leave london that inevitable but the degree of exodus and timeline for this needs to be as seamless as possible this is one of those areas that really truly is in both parties interests to manage smoothly almost all other areas the eu is largely free to tell the uk where to go ,31,worldnews

Weddingbox,do you have any examples of number 2 i am sceptical because for any secured lending accepting anything so volatile as undiversified shares seems like a terrible form of collateral in the first place surely banks will be looking at fundamentals cash flows future earnings to determine ability to repay the loan and any collateral would be in the form of value retaining saleable assets i could be shown to be wrong but i do not think any bank is engaging in secured lending to large companies with nothing but the company own shares as collateral the real impact of share prices is that it makes equity finance more expensive and more difficult other than that share price movements in the secondary market are largely just a symbol of perception which does have indirect impacts but it not a very simple relationship happy to be countered though ,2,worldnews

Weddingbox,it a very interesting question which really relates to liability and risks and rewards of the different ways to raise money for a business say i want to start a lemonade stand on my street i have only got 10 quid so i buy some lemons with that i still need money for a crate a sign a chair and cups and a lemon squeezer i go to the local old man and ask him for 50 he agrees but wants paid back in a week to which i agree i have just formed a sole owner business with 10 of initial capital from me and a 50 loan from the old man me and the business are the same entity turns out i am shite at selling lemonade and next week the old man comes for his 50 i do not have it i am afraid old man well he says i will need to take all your supplies to recoup my loan but a second hand chair and some manky cups are not going to get me the 50 i am owed so because you are a sole owner you and the business are one entity and my loan was with you so i can take some of your personal property to recoup my loan your shoes will do the trick well that annoying i have lost my original 10 and my shoes to avoid this situation next time i will get a pal involved next summer my pal and i do the same thing again we each put in 5 and then go back to the old man and ask for another loan luckily he senile and the presence of my friend confuses him to forgetting about me being a terrible lemon salesman he agrees the same 50 and arrangements as before we are now a partnership with a 50 loan turns out my pal is just as much of a useless bastard as me and the old man comes back for his money which we do not have a partnership is similar to a sole owner but spread over more people to cover his loan this time the old man takes all our used equipment but then takes one of each of our shoes well not as bad as last time but having only one shoe is still a right nuisance next time we will make the company a separate legal entity so we can stop getting our shoes nicked by a senile old man next summer comes around my friend and i form a limited company and we each own 1 share for which we pay 5 the company has 10 of share capital we go back to the old man and get the exact same loan again he has a nice pension ok he will be fine but this time his loan is to the company and not to us two reprobates personally we have invested 5 each into a limited company worth 60 remember we still cannot sell lemons to save our lives but when the old man comes back he can only take the company assets our contributed capital too is gone by now but the old man claim is with the company which now that he taken all the supplies is completely worthless he takes a loss on his loan because the legal person he lent it to the company is now bankrupt but hey at least we still have our shoes but we are starting to feel bad about the old man this time we will sell shares to the neighbourhood to raise the required 60 turns out though that selling shares to the general public a public limited liability company requires you to obey lots of rules about how you advertise those shares and costs a lot of money if our limited company had been successful we could have gone public by asking the local banker to help us get in line with these rules and to sell them to the neighbourhood on our behalf as a trustworthy person who knows how to do this because however we are scheming bastards who do not obey the rules and have a terrible reputation this does not happen and we go our separate ways the difference is liability when the company is a separate legal person the owners can only lose the money they put in their liability is limited when the owners and the business are effectively the same legal entity they can lose more than the money they put in their liability is unlimited it obviously more complicated than this but the basic concept of liability is how these structures were formed in our society long ago ,3,explainlikeimfive

Weddingbox,good on you for properly researching and thinking about this the mere fact that you wrote and edited so much of your post sort of proves the point whether article 50 is reversible or not is a central point of this case if it can be reversed then the government could trigger it alone prerogative then if parliament does not consent the government would be legally obliged to rescind article 50 also the way the cjeu works is that it there to advise national courts on areas of eu law and in fact due to a recent court case the name of which i cannot recall a national court is legally obliged to seek cjeu advice in such matters or the national court judgement could be easily reversed ,2,worldnews
Weddingbox,actually a key point in today ruling centred on whether article 50 is reversible the government case stated that it was not reversible and this point was not contested by the claimants when the supreme court rules they will have to implicitly rule on whether article 50 can be reversed either they uphold the high court and implicitly rule it not reversible or they quash the high court by finding it reversible either way they are likely to request a preliminary ruling on this point specifically from the cjeu unless of course they base their decision on the other points of law in the case however as the question of article 50 was a central point of the decision is unlikely to be ignored and hence will likely require input from cjeu ironic is not it ,1,worldnews
