palodequeso,duh beer but seriously let dig in how is your online code presence do you have a portfolio or better yet a well used github page have you contributed to projects outside of work do you hang out in any local tech communities or online chats in slack or something as far as education goes what i have learned after going to digipen and penn state harrisburg is that a good education is really hard to find most of the time you are learning how to learn then you extend that skill into personal projects i have seen people go to the best schools and get no jobs because they really do not have a passion and do not care conversely i have seen people get a community college degree and do truly great things in summary go to a regular public school but find a community find a community to hang out in locally as well filled with nerds of all walks find some passion projects do them even if you do not finish work on them create a code presence online and i know for an introvert the idea of community is scary but keep in mind 90 of the people in said communities are the same way and never forget beer ,2,webdev

palodequeso,my good buddy pointed out the flaw i was assuming that each state would vote and tally up their electoral votes and then the state can choose whether it winner take all or they send in the electoral votes as they are but as he pointed out it just that the states that are winner take all most of them just take the popular vote within the state to figure out who gets their electoral votes that does not mean however each state weight is equal but for states that are smaller and more urbanized they get less electoral votes but can have a lot higher population density so i suspect my hypothesis is still correct although the affect is less intense ,2,Ask_Politics
palodequeso,ps i did some of the math ahead of time but there still things i am not sure on which is why i asked in the first place if we have a suspected population of 324 227 000 https en wikipedia org wiki demography of the united states there are 538 electoral votes that means on average there are 602652 4 votes per electoral vote but of course it is not distributed evenly as shown by this map http www slate com articles news and politics map of the week 2012 11 presidential election a map showing the vote power of all 50 states html however what i want to know is how is this same effect broken down by political party not state ,2,Ask_Politics

palodequeso,i was looking for a game like this here some feedback if you want to slow the game down a bit maybe limit the distance you can travel via teleportation perhaps add traditional locomotion for those who can handle it as a separate game mechanic maybe if you have a two handed weapon make it so you can switch to a color blob shooter thingy but have it have a timer to make it so you cannot just blast color everywhere just so you do not get stuck at the end of a map and have to wait for a teammate when teleporting maybe it could highlight the square you are pointing at just as a quick visual aid for the ar i should note that a real red dot does not have to be lined up if you can see the dot the bullets shot go there but you have to be looking at it from a roughly straight on angle please take all of this with a grain of salt i really enjoyed playing this type of game in vr and will be looking for the full release regardless of your changes ,2,Vive
palodequeso,no it will be running servo their new renderer built in rust which is likely to destroy bolt or webkit i run chrome now but i eagerly await a real servo and browser html based browser ,-2,webdev

palodequeso,i have confirmed that it is one base station in particular that seems to have stopped tracking properly not sure why it just happened i have tried swapping the sensors using the sync cable and not using the sync cable and all various forms of black magic mentioned in this post ,1,Vive
palodequeso,i just started having this issue did you ever find a way to resolve it ,1,Vive

palodequeso,aaaaaand still no module support ,1,webdev
palodequeso,i had a great time playing last night everything connected right away it was great i had a session where i was 5 kills and 8 deaths and in the last minute went to like 9 8 i got 4 kills without dying and it made me wonder if i had found a fun bug because i did take a few hits ,1,HoverJunkers
palodequeso,yea that makes sense i do have crappy dsl living in the boonies and all however it has worked really well in the past so that tells me it probably not a router setting i will keep tinkering great work btw you guys are inspiring me to hack on some more game demos again ,1,HoverJunkers
palodequeso,i find that statement to be truthy ,1,Vive
palodequeso,fedex 3 23 pm est htc 6 21 pm est,2,Vive
palodequeso,got my fedex delivery manager email yesterday htc email last night and real charge on my card this morning everything fell into place seems like they are getting their shit together ,3,Vive

palodequeso,how do we check with fedex again ,1,Vive
palodequeso,valve already does support other hmds they made a library called openvr the issue is that occulus belongs to facebook now and it made palmer into a pompous arse as he claims it would never work well to use said open library which is complete fucking bullshit ,1,Vive
palodequeso,i bought axiom verge as a distraction ,2,Vive
palodequeso,i had a dream last night that i got my tracking number i woke up at 3am and checked my email lo and behold there was an email from htc but of course my dream turned into a nightmare when it was a request to fill out survey questions from customer support i hope we start seeing more shipments go out consistently this is my first time pre ordering anything except fallout 4 and i was hoping it would go smoothly since i got in at 06 oh well ,5,Vive
palodequeso,oooh put that on a gist on github ,2,Vive
palodequeso,i do enjoy both of those things and i am even a bleeding heart liberal ,2,Vive
palodequeso,1 where ,1,Vive
palodequeso,i think it was like 876 for me or something close to that i cannot remember since the f ing pre auth is gone ,1,Vive
palodequeso,newville pa up in it ,1,Vive
palodequeso,exact same 06 pa pre auth gone no shipping might as well keep playing fallout 4 on survival mode as it brings me slightly more joy ,2,Vive
palodequeso,this mode is amazing but i do believe a portable sleeping bag is missing it would not allow you to quicksave whenever you want as in you would have to clear an area first and you would not be fully rested since there a 5 hour sleep limit for sleeping bags but at least you could setup camp to save or restore some fatigue during a longer mission ,2,fo4
palodequeso,pa here charge has been pending since thursday still no shipping notification i pre ordered within the first minute too ,3,Vive
palodequeso,note2 i updated it to have a shorter short text anyway https jsfiddle net sa6uu3f7 2 ,1,webdev

palodequeso,when i do bower install hexagon js save i get bower enotfound package hexagon js not found but it looks so awesome i am sad ,0,programming
palodequeso,yea i have been waiting for 1 0 to drop but i plan on digging into gfx rs pretty seriously in a week or so i cannot wait ,3,rust
palodequeso,sweet someone referenced the example i wrote ,3,rust
palodequeso,oh i thought this was r programmerhumor for a second ,6,programming
palodequeso,recently i started delving pretty deeply into rust with one of my major complaints of c being that there is no pip cargo npm equivalent bii might make me want to continue some of those old projects again not that i will ditch my efforts with rust ,1,programming
palodequeso,you should definitely take some screenshots and post them so we have a better idea of what to expect before just signing up ,2,programming
palodequeso,quick question is it possible to register component types in more than one place like can a hypothetical engine register some and then a hypothetical game build on said engine register some after that ,1,rust
palodequeso,great work i came across your project before but i noticed the vec u8 hack and the unsafe code and got scared away i decided to start in on a new one but it seems your re factor is just want i wanted to see great work i will most likely be integrating this into my project a s a p ,1,rust
palodequeso,having data in my enums and then pulling said data out via a match statement is pretty killer clean and sugary to accomplish the same in c you would need a struct with a type and a union of the different data types and the type would have to be an enum and you still would not get the exhaustion check that you would with rust match game development,19,rust
