LizzyMcGuireMovie,well the first step is demonstrating steps that will actually accomplish anything for example germany is making what appear to be tremendous and expensive strides in reducing emissions yet their emissions are up we do not need to follow their mistakes i was actually in germany recently and i thought an interesting measure they had taken was to ration fuel on a weekly basis i did not drive so i cannot say how they kept track of how much gas you used something like that i believe would actually encourage more carpooling and using more public transport but i do not think americans would realistically be on board i agree that nuclear energy is exciting but if it were feasible utilities and petrol companies would be pouncing on the opportunity they are not yet partially because of prohibitive regulations a good first step would be lifting the regulatory burdens associated with nuclear energy ,2,Futurology

LizzyMcGuireMovie,the majority of americans also have no idea what the evonomic ramifications of the accord are that why the president has to decide he listens to advisers and experts not just environmental but also economic and comes to an informed decision saying the majority of people want to be in the agreement is basically just like saying the majority of people care about the environment which is true but how many of them realize that their energy costs could more than double that the price of goods and services go up with higher energy costs are they aware of how much of their tax money is being going to be used might there be sometheing more impactful beneficial we could use the 100b year for american citizens can think all sorts of things are nice sure we would love free healthcare or to feed every person in the world but the average citizen does not have to look at the budget and prioritize so we want our tax dollar stretched further decrease the global temperate by a tenth of a centigrade over decades or improve education infrastructure healthcare etc at home in the usa ,3,Futurology
LizzyMcGuireMovie,i get that it a compelling issue but people act as if environmentalism is the only aspect of all of this and that those who are against the accord just do not care about the environment it been made very clear that the primary reason for stepping away from the accord it economic so there are many pros and cons far beyond just environment vs economy people can make up their own minds as to which side outweighs the other but i think we should all ask of ourselves and others to at least try to understand all of the other many complex implications of it look at that pros and cons list objectively and at least be open to changing your initial stance ,2,science

LizzyMcGuireMovie,yeah i had my psg and the kids sl in the office making the case with me we did not think we needed to bring it up to him earlier because we assumed he would ask for our recommendation before signing his packet basically the kid was black and the commander at this point was petrified of eo after some other shit that had gone down in the company so his reasoning was that the soldier beeded to be counseled by sl then elevated to pl then elevated to cdr to demonstrate that the kid is not getting any better and we are trying everytjing we can my point was that nothing he did was so absolutely egregious to warrant being counseled by the cdr he was just a generally lazy disrespectful shitbag who should not be an nco ,3,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie, the comparison is absolutely valid you will receive lower medical costs under a single payer system that a tangible benefit for some maybe for others premiums have skyrocketed nothing is free if it being payed for or heavily subsidized by the government everyone who pays taxes paid for it go vote if you want lets see how many people agree with me well we just did republicans control the executive branch and both houses of congress after getting a taste of aca despite democrats pushing for redistribution of wealth to provide free stuff warping the promotion of the general welfare to push socialism is a pretty far stretch the obvious counter argument being that single payer is not in fact the way to promote the general welfare and that a free market is ,1,SandersForPresident
LizzyMcGuireMovie,i ran into that with wanting to recommend one of my e4 not be considered for promotion because he was a dirtbag commander absolutely knew the guy was a dirtbag and straight up told me he would have backed me up on it if i had brought the specific issues and counseling statements to his attention earlier i had dozens of even oriented counselings on the guy but never showed the commander until the 11th hour when i heard he was going to recommend for promotion to be fair though i think that rather than blanket recommending everyone who is available cdr should have a quick sit down with the pls and psgs and go over who is coming up on eligibility well ahead of time and have a little dialogue i felt like my authority over the soldier was ripped away by someone who knew less about him than i did ,4,army

LizzyMcGuireMovie, as to opting out that wo not work i cannot opt out of paying for the us military despite my complete lack of support for it you cannot opt out of this either for the same reasons it comes with the citizenship contract you recieve a benefit from paying for the military in the form of your national defense and security that is a part of the social contract living in a society which provides for the common defense and protection of life liberty and property the comparison is not valid because by living here there no way you could opt out of recieving that protection no sane person would argue for cherry picking which services you want to pay for and recieve the argument is the role of government and what is moral vs immoral to force you to pay for insurance has twisted the game up insurance is used for all routine healthcare which is completely unnecessary it meant to provide coverage for something catastrophic car insurance covers collisions not routine maintenence and oil changes the government can pass legislation to fix the problems but i do not believe socialism is the answer although neither is the system we had in place before aca which had also basically evolved into socialism ,0,SandersForPresident
LizzyMcGuireMovie,i understand how it works and the negative impact on the economy there should be the option to opt out of paying into and recieving these services in almost every country which has universal healthcare there is a black market of private healthcare where people go and pay out of pocket for better quality and shorter wait times the entire thing is a sham the problem with selling healthcare is that when you add the need to drive a profit you inevitably have to charge more it just required when you need to drive profit you have to be competitive competition is the only way to keep quality high and prices low but instead we turn to mandates and subsidies ,1,SandersForPresident

LizzyMcGuireMovie,health care is a commodity doctors do not become doctors to serve society they do it for the money when canadians need quality healthcare they shell out the cash for a private practice or come to america if they want to gamble their life on their mess of a public healthcare system they need to prepare for rediculous wait times and susbstandard care it just a fact ,-5,nottheonion
LizzyMcGuireMovie,maybe there something in the plan of action that punitive but i doubt it op is not an nco so he is not rated so unless the nco here uses it as leverage to influence something else school selection promotion recommendation there really no punishment about this at all it just a paper record of an nco straightening out a troop for both of their protection if no one ever sees the counseling because this is the one time op fucked up it wo not matter i am thinking op and others are under the impression that counseling statements are stored in some personnel file permanent record nah they go in the ncos desk when one of you pcs he throws them all away ,1,army

LizzyMcGuireMovie,nah nah nah there no such thing as a negative counseling there is only the da4856 developmental counseling this is not a punishment this is exactly what counseling statements are meant for you did x you should have done y here are some reasons that was a fuck up in order to prevent this from happening again in the future you will do z to ensure that you accomplish y nco is just documenting that he developed op by letting him know where he fucked up what he should have done instead and how he will make sure it does not happen again now when the commander says ssg walker why did pfc johnson let his cac expire ssg walker can tell him exactly why because he found out during the key points of discussion and tell the commander what guidance he gave op to correct the issue and then say would you like to see a copy of the counseling sir ,1,army

LizzyMcGuireMovie,conservatives believe as much if not more that society has an obligation to support the downtrodden the difference is we believe it should be done through community such as churches and neighborhoods rather than through government compulsion it was once the norm that sunday service would hold a second collection for a member family going through a tough time or that neighbors would bring over caseroles when the mother wife was hospitalized or come over and mow the lawn and help take care of the home while the father husband was ill neighbors would try to find something temporary at their job to help a friend who was laid off the hungry were fed through donations to food banks organizations such as the salvation army were seen as a primary type of charity not big daddy government the left conflates charity with the distribution of wealth how are we going to pay for this single womans 8 children their answer is not through charitable donations but stealing from society ,3,The_Donald
LizzyMcGuireMovie, i would say the societal structure the army career model 1950s era where a family has one primary breadwinner is no longer applicable difficult to sell your spouse on constantly sacrificing their career for yours over 20 years sure but having a family once you are in the army or entering the army when you have a family is purely the choice of the sm the army has not drafted anyone recently if there minor things we can change to improve that situation great but our modern army is already very accomodating to personal lives compared to any other army ever ,1,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie, the army definitely seems to be structured around rewarding officers who fully commit their life to it by placing all family considerations second to their career makes you wonder if that mentality really helps us retain the best people i mean do we preferentially retain people who commit more time and energy to their career i hope so just so this does not devolve into a circlejerk about how dumb it is to stay in the office until 2000 we are both talking about dudes who embrace tdy deployments schools whatever quality of dudes is a seperate consideration i am just thinking on the black and white of this one can dudes have great family lives and great careers for sure but this career in particular demands sacrifices to succeed ,2,army

LizzyMcGuireMovie,what you are describing represents a very small fraction of people most people who oppose abortion do so because they literally believe it is murdering an infant that actually pretty easy to see where they are coming from right imagine the horror from their perspective if they believe abortion is murdering a baby of course they are going to try to stop it you cannot just dismiss them as being evil woman haters no one can give a definitive answer as to when a life is a life that why the issue is so murky both sides get worked up in a fervor about it but both sides have valid points for example the classic poor woman who has a child will use more entitlements therefore causing more harm to society and the unwanted child will become a criminal well it kind of sounds like you are arguing eugenics but it true it will probably be better for everyone if that baby is never born on the flip side one might say that you are literally killing a baby what can you say to that it just devolves into an argument of opinions about when life starts ,2,TwoXChromosomes

LizzyMcGuireMovie, it enough wealth to establish new industries uae is a good example of somewhere that is already investing in tourism ie dubai the beauty in the opportunity these countries have is that they are so wealthy right now they can afford to develop beautiful resorts it seems like if when the oil ever does run out the uae will be okay economically at least if we look at the country sort of in a vacuum of course if their neighbors do not prepare similarly there may be a lot of conflict between those muslim have and have not countries also worth noting that uae at least around dubai has westernized significantly this may also paint them as a target if the surrounding nations soccumb to extremism when they run out of wealth and have not invested in other industries ,6,dataisbeautiful

LizzyMcGuireMovie,a1 clones were pretty popular recently it will probably be hard to find the triangle handguard even harder on a complete ar as it kind of a niche thing also if you want to be really authentic with it the a1 rear sight is different from the a2 the flash hider on the a1 is also different with the bottom being open and the twist rate would be either 1 in 14 or 1 in 12 although you may want to skip that because no one will be able to tell and ammo that works well with that will be really expensive all in all this would be a clasic example of something you would be better off building yourself i am sure there are a few manufacturers out there making them but it will probably be limited and unecessarily expensive ,1,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie,because you can make one that so much better and play around with customizations you could not ever do on your issue weapon you want to make one under 5 pounds that fun now you need another with a long match grade barrel free float that bitch and punch 1 moa all day and reach out to 800m that fun too now you need an all around go to war carbine fuck yeah now you need an sbr technically pistol to fit in a back pack 10 5 inch barrel with a sick compensator shockwave blade brace you want to spray paint those bitches do it switch out flash hiders and brakes and comps do it adjustable gas block or play around with different buffer weights or springs different twist rates for use with different projectiles what kind of handguard do you like quad rail that very 2008 of you but cool keymod m lok some space age looking shit throwback plastic with the absolutely flooded ar and ar accessory market there are so many cool things you can do also do not buy complete ars you are right on that it stupid and overpriced and boring piece them together from the ground up ,3,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie, the 20 barrel m 16 was always my favorite i like the 20 barrel too i wish they had put a carbine buffer and colllapsible stock on the a4 then it would be perfect helps address the length and manueverability issue without sacrificing barrel length and thus velocity ,1,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie,hoppes 9 bore cleaner is just a solvent marked waaay the hell up and sold as a gun cleaning product a good solvent the only way you are going to remove copper and possible lead fouling from the barrel a boresnake and clp alone are not going to cut it yes you will see carbon come out and when you look down the barrel it will be smooth and shiny but you cannot see the build up in the bite between the lands and grooves clp is just oil with some detergent yes i know the army does not endorse solvents for operator level maintenence i was mostly joking i do not use solvents on army weapons just personal ones ,1,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie,so much fun it makes you wonder why the rifle qual is so static in comparison ,1,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie,so just the handguard and the stock i would be stoked for that put on a super lightweight keymod or mlok handguard and an mft minimalist stock both in a sexy fde m4 government profile barrels are kind of a necessary evil for a legit warfighting weapon in a world of red dot optics and flip up rear sights i definitely would love to take off the front sight post and put on a low profile block and then have a truly free floated rail like a 13inch handguard gain all that much more sight radius for the flip up front sight but that will never fly ,0,army

LizzyMcGuireMovie,the aimpoint has unlimited eye relief so it does not need to be right up on your eye like a scope by mounting it further rearward all you are doing is adding the cluster of the optic housing itself to block your peripheral vision which of course is bad because again a cco is not a scope and we shoot with both eyes open also the whole parallax free thing can be compromised when you have a red dot right up in your eye partially because that not how it meant to be used ,2,army

LizzyMcGuireMovie,it supposed to be mounted as far forward on the upper reciever as possible even on a flat top m4 upper ,1,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie,well with this setup you cannot cowitness at all which means the sight is significantly higher than the bore so parallax is kindof irellevant placing the optic that high is less than ideal for a flexible zero meaning it would not work as well at varying distances ,1,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie,what you cannot see the third position because the switch itself is covering it ,1,army
LizzyMcGuireMovie,the aimpoints are pretty straightforward not sure it takes much additional training it literally zero then aim and shoot the whole anti parallax makes it much easier and more reliable with less than ideal cheek welds but yeah i can see locking them up to prevent losses when you really are not going to use them,8,army

LizzyMcGuireMovie,that like missing 1 4 of all of those classes you paid good money for you need to talk to your unit and school do not just ask your squad leader tell your squad leader and psg you would like to use the commanders open door policy and talk to him face to face about it and you would like them as your nco support chain to be there with you if your school will allow you to take the time away it will still fuck you bigly by causing you to fall behind ideally your unit would excuse you from ntc but this is on you to figure out a solution ask your pl to help you in talking to the school ,2,army

LizzyMcGuireMovie,i really enjoyed having my office as a deployed pl out in the motorpool while the company and bn toc were a good 10 minute walk away no one ever came by so i would peace out at 1700 for chow and go to the hooch have my email open there until around 1830 i definitely felt that pressure to stay late because my commander would be in the office until like 2000 and constantly talking about how much work he has and how he wishes he could come hang out with the troops but cannot then i spent about a week hanging out in the toc one time and realized that that motherfucker spent most of the day fucking around and then actually got to work at like 1600 fuck that he measured performance by hours spent in the office i operated on getting shit done i know it caused his opinion of me to suffer but i did not care he loved the maintenence pl who would sit around in the office until 2000 as well but i heard youtube videos coming from that guys office all day ,1,army
