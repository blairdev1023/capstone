bsrapp,i will never have an issue with that attitude but i would like to speak as someone that is often described as patriotic in sense that is catching some flak here the main reason that i am as proud as i am of the usa is the fact that my great grandfather and great grandmother immigrated as children from italy where from my understanding the future was fairly dim at time he ended up getting a job in the midwest coal mines and was just happy to have work his daughter would go on to become a nurse and all three of his grandchildren would get bachelors degrees or higher every generation of my family has helped the next one and before i started school my father looked at me and said that he would do everything he could to get me through school with as little debt as possible because that what every generation has done before him and it what i will do for my children one day this country is what gave my family a new start and it far from perfect and it very possible that my family could have stayed in italy and i could be doing the same thing right now i am proud of my own accomplishments but i am also proud of my family and my country because we have all helped one another and i cannot describe what that means to me ,1,germany

bsrapp,can we just start posting it over here daily when he puts it up cause that would be awesome ,1,DanLeBatardShow
bsrapp,found burr podcast from jre the only thing i hate is he only got the monday morning podcast and the thursday afternoon right before friday just checking in on you one and they are only like an hour or so ,3,DanLeBatardShow

bsrapp,binged newsradio a few weeks ago and it is really underrated in my opinion ,1,movies

bsrapp,i believe the world needs more people like you ,2,television
bsrapp,definitely with you p r and this are my top two recent comedies i feel in the minority in this sub and really reddit as a whole but i really could not ever enjoy the office so i was always scared off of going with recommendations from reddit but finally i caved and i am so happy i did ,1,television

bsrapp,because they are all so great to me for so many different reason which makes them super tough to compare to one another for me ,1,marvelstudios
bsrapp,thank you but you are seriously splitting hairs there ,1,marvelstudios
bsrapp,that an evil question but gun to my head i would have to choose civil war for the aforementioned reason that it pulls me both ways so well and i get just about every hero in it ,1,marvelstudios
bsrapp,yes i completely agree with you i loved it and honestly i liked it more the second time i watched it and it just so difficult to top the magic of the first one because now we know what to expect going in ,1,marvelstudios
bsrapp,thank you that was problem my most thought out comment in my entire reddit history and i know it a subject that can be touchy for some also i should have prefaced this with the fact that i am by no means a film critic and i have never read the comics ,1,marvelstudios
bsrapp,after watching it for the second time i rank it behind the original but it my second favorite sequel and i would have to say number six on my overall list and i will have to give it a little time to make sure that it is not just the new shinny thing effect but i want to put it in with these movies and not in the next lower tier ,5,marvelstudios
bsrapp,iron man was the beginning of it all and gave us the gift that is rdj avengers still makes me giddy to see everyone come together and it proved that the whole mcu was actually possible and not just a dream winter soldier had a tone that was completely different from anything we had seen in the mcu which was and still is refreshing along with being extremely well written and suspenseful guardians of the galaxy is true most rewatched of any movie because there is not a single member i do not love and gunn has a style that is all his own civil war every time i watch it i always bounce around who side i agree with even though i know how it all goes down and this fact still messes with my mind in the best way possible ,18,marvelstudios
bsrapp,throw in iron man and avengers and and i am honestly splitting hairs because i love all of the equally but for many different reasons ,18,marvelstudios
bsrapp,i cannot find it but i thought that grrm had said that he definitely did not want rr or even possibly dance done because there was already so much done on them in the books and wanted to explore more ,1,asoiaf
bsrapp,very happy about the casting but part of me feels a little bad cause i do not want to see him typecast as an evil bad guy when he is seriously crazy talented and i could see him turning into a leading man ,7,Marvel
bsrapp,since i did not see it i just wanted to comment that his son did appear to be making a good recovery and he took the time off to be with his family who are all now home ,4,television
bsrapp,i am seriously so thankful for this sub one cause holy fuck i just want the season to start already but more importantly i was talking with some people earlier today that were trying to say how great this judge was for holding the coach and program responsible for this then when i tried to explain strong previous record and that his focus was to try and help the kids on his team become better men and that he had just came to this team they did not give a shit and basically ignored me sorry for the rant but thanks again everyone and good luck this season ,6,CFB

bsrapp,fuck cancer is right ,2,reactiongifs
bsrapp,that a pretty fair evaluation imo but i am happy that it on starz over amc or fx because it allows them to do things they would have most likely cut like the biliquis scene which was super messed but at the same time interesting as someone who never read the book ,9,reactiongifs
bsrapp,that fair i personally like shows on cable less because they usually seem to pull punches to fit in the ratings game and when they are on hbo starz showtime etc they do not have the same worry ,2,reactiongifs
bsrapp,i agree as long as the story comes first i would be fine with a ridiculously long season but i just see too many shows sacrifice story so they can fill some arbitrary schedule to make the old network heads happy that being said if more stores go off of what agents did i would be thrilled ,1,Marvel
bsrapp,yeah that was definitely a great choice but i hate how a lot of shows now say well we need 18 23 episodes and just purposely drag out their stories to fill a season instead of tightening it up and making a great show so i am happy with the shorter season ,39,Marvel
bsrapp,what would of rather it be on starz is not bad in my opinion black sails was fantastic spartacus was fun for the most part and so far most of the things i have heard the network let them make the show that should do right by all us ,12,reactiongifs
bsrapp,unlimited powah ,1,worldnews
bsrapp,see i would say the opposite most people i know that turn to espn just want to get a short sports fix the old school sportscenter was perfect for that highlights of pretty much every game standings and then they would fill the viewers in on any trades injuries or other news as it was happening now when i do watch sportscenter it seems like over half of the show is interviews with movie stars about random things that have nothing to do with sports or talking heads saying the most inflammatory thing they can think of to try and get internet hits this move has basically alienated a ton of sports fans which i never understood because most nonsports fans are not going to turn to a channel that everyone knows as playing sports 24 7 365 ,6,television

bsrapp,i know they are not much but some people probably would rather not have any extra weight was my thinking especially when you hear of people having slides milled to lose weight i think it just a personal preference deal but i have got nothing against lights ,1,Glocks

bsrapp,if anyone could have done it i would have guessed that it was bill simmons but unfortunately it does not seem to be working the best right now ,4,sports
bsrapp,the sad part was that kanell actually did try to go that way over the last year and the fired him for trying to fit into the ridiculous culture they are building ,6,sports

bsrapp,wait are both gone or just kanell ,5,CFB
bsrapp,i am watching russillo kanell right now and it blowing my mind because they did not even get a second host to come in to sit in for danny so i am honestly wondering if someone just sat and threw darts at a board this morning to decide who was getting fired ,10,CFB

bsrapp,not 100 sure but my general understanding so far has been that it would allow isp to throttle down websites with the idea that then the isp can request different sites to pay a fee to avoid this the other side i have heard a few times is that this will allow the isp to provide better faster connections to the sites their customers want but i have never heard of an isp doing something from the goodness of their heart i am by no means an expert so i am not positive about this but it been my understanding up to this point edit crap forgot the important part is that this would allow the isp to throttle down websites that spoke against them or who they were supporting limiting free speech and forcing their customers to see things how they want them to ,21,technology
bsrapp,touch and really i think it is kinda neat i just saw it as a solution in search of a problem but as someone stated earlier it makes sense for surfers and if it keeps someone from drowning i am not going to hate on it much especially since as a kid i ducking hated wearing my life vest and if someone told me i could wear a james bond watch instead i would have been thrilled ,3,interestingasfuck

bsrapp,honestly did not know about this rule until today and i feel ashamed but it does make sense ,1,CFB
bsrapp,i like the way you think but also completely correct ,1,CFB
bsrapp,i think people are more upset with how targeting is an automatic ejection when a lot of the times it is not malicious and i see a lot of cases where it would be extremely difficult to avoid head to head contact with that said as the rule goes that was definitely targeting but i saw a bunny hop that ended up with head to head contact because another player was already pulling him down ,1,CFB

bsrapp,i would second the walther have not shot one yet but have seen a lot of people that love them and it definitely on my list ,2,handguns
bsrapp,i know id personally prefer something larger in the compact to full size range for home defense and 45 is a perfectly acceptable defense round but with that being said when it comes to shooting 45 nothing beats a 1911 ,2,handguns
bsrapp,i second buffalo trace for the price it one of my standbys ,2,whiskey

bsrapp,yeah i saw that and it seems like it was one of the easiest to put on or off and that his plan for it he never cared about the bikini top because if the weather was good enough for it it was good enough for everything to be off but thanks for the heads up ,1,Jeep
bsrapp,this made me laugh way more than i would like to admit thank you ,3,Glocks
