Or you can just... not enable the highest fucking settings available, because absolute majority of gameworks libraries, except FXAA and perhaps couple more, are the highest preset available on modern AAA titles in their respective areas, with appropriate sibling from AMD's own library of vendor lock-ins being the competitor.

> And it's 100% possible to implement these visual enhancements without using nvidia's black box code and if they were implemented outside of it then both older nvidia cards and amd cards could be optimized for appropriately and you would be able to get decent performance even if you don't choose to buy the newest nvidia card.

Not really, it is a deterrent, namely a factor that makes decision weighted against it, not a control form.

> also how can you make that assumption in the case of intelligence/ethnicity when you can never fully control for the differences socio-economic/cultural/historical conditions in groups large enough to make up a necessary sample size to draw a statistically relevant conclusion?

Mostly because of implications. Ultimately, environment has to do with sort of information that trains the brain network. How well that one is initially wired and set is almost all genetics  imho.
