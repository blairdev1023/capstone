Thank you s much for responding I'm having internet issues this afternoon/evening and currently typing via phone hopefully I can send a proper response tonight,1,RedPillWives
Internet problems all day but will be on later if it resolves to respond further thanks for commenting!,1,RedPillWives
"So I think the idea that a city’s design can be sexist is ridiculous. While some of the issues they highlight are real, looking at this solely through the lens of gender seems incredibly unintelligent and selfish. From what I can tell the root causes of the various issues mentioned are the result of: social class, ethnicity/culture, older systems being incompatible with new technology, and human nature in general. If a problem impacts women, that doesn’t mean that the problem is inherently anti - women in some way. 

For example, it’s great that new features are being installed to make public areas safer such as more lighting. But acting like women are the only victims, and that the biggest crime is sexual harassment, will only prevent people from coming up with truly innovative ideas. I also feel like it’s really dishonest to compare American issues to the issues occurring in other countries. The sexual harassment happening in the US is nothing compared to what women go through oversees. And American feminism is not the solution for either problems! 
 
To me this looks like a sneaky way to increase mass surveillance and government involvement in our lives. They are upping the amount of cameras “for our safety” but what about encouraging women (and everyone) to learn how to defend themselves and their fellow peers? Cities are being designed so that they are “communal” and mass transportation is the most viable option. What about privacy and individuality? I hate that soon freely driving your car isn’t going to be a thing. Self driving cars and hi tech public transportation systems are seen as the ideal but that is so limiting. Instead of trying to change the layout of an area to promote an agenda, why not consider that the agenda itself is at odds with the ways humans naturally organize?",1,RedPillWives
">Right. I could be more specific in some things. I guess I just don't know what else to say except that I""m being a bitch. Specific instances of that really won't detract from that. But if you think it will help.
 
Why are you responding this way to someone trying to help you? Can you see that right now you are engaging in behaviour that acts as a defense against change? How can you seriously act like you know more about what would or wouldn’t help you get better in this situation. YOU came to US for assistance. And now you are getting dismissive?   
 
If you can’t point to *exactly* what you are doing wrong how will you be able to correct the problems? “I’m a bitch” is as useful as saying “I’m sick”. A doctor can’t do anything without understanding the specific symptoms and background factors. The treatment for a cold and lung cancer are so different despite coughing being a shared symptom. 
 
Thank you for sharing a more comprehensive list of what you’ve been doing wrong. I find this far more useful than what you mentioned in your original post. Take a good look at #3 and realise that this is a pattern you have in general, not with him. Everything you’ve listed here is terrible and I’m glad you came back to RPW to deal with this. It’s clearly not something you can handle alone. 
 
>Humor is just my way of speaking really. Probably a bad habit when trying to actually be taken seriously, like in this post.
 
Yes it is not helping you at all. I still stand by my assertion that you are using it as a crutch to make yourself feel better about posting and to minimize some of the damage you’ve done to your relationship. Your tone doesn't always match up to the gravity of the situation and it’s concerning. 
 
>The way I feel when these things happen are basically like I go in well intentioned, but then something will just knock out the perfection of the moment and I'll just flip my shit...But it is an example of how I will like try to be 'ok' but then things don't go EXACTLY how I think they should and totally focus on how he fucked up.
 
This is the crux of the issue and it is why you need to focus on: managing emotions in the moment, having regular activities that allow you to let out negative emotions, showing unwavering respect to your man. It’s good that your man handles things the way that he does but I’m wondering if this is enough for you? Do you think you are acting a certain way in an attempt to incite him? Could you be subconsciously trying to get a more extreme reaction? You don’t seem to feel much dread, and you “get away” with a lot of bad behaviour. You say that you’ve been feeling superior to him - do you think he is dominant enough for you? Or perhaps he is dominant but he isn’t expressive enough to keep you in line. This is not about finding a flaw in him but rather getting to the root of why you are doing what you’re doing. You mentioned that this is your first sober, RP, LTR; could you be trying to create a dysfunctional relationship because that’s what you’re more used to? Is this self sabotage? Or maybe you’re just the type of woman who legitimately needs a more aggressive man. 
 
I’m glad you’ve lost weight and I hope you continue to get healthier. Your mood whiplash came out of nowhere? Have there been any changes in any other area of your life that could be contributing to your emotional imbalance? Missing AA meetings could definitely be related to this, as well as the general lack of self care. /u/PhantomDream09 has great suggestions, as do all the women on the sub. But please don’t close yourself off to what I’m saying just because it is harsher and more difficult.

"First - welcome back to RPW! It was shocking when you left so abruptly and without any indication as to why, but it makes sense now. The issues you are struggling with don't sound pleasant and I really hope you turn it around and save your relationship. If your man can't trust you to accept him as he is and respect him, things will only get worse and he will probably leave you. It doesn't matter how good you were in the past or how good you *could* be. If you aren't presently an asset to him or making clear strides in that direction, he's going to start thinking about being with a woman who can give him what he wants. 

Your post is really vague and you seem to be relying on humor to make things seem better than they are (or to make you feel better about submitting the post). Repeating “I’m a huge bitch” with slight variations doesn’t give us the information we need to help you come up with *concrete steps.* That list you give at the end is true and helpful but it’s not enough to solve your problems. You said you want someone to knock you off your high horse so here you go: You are a single mother, overweight, and a former alcoholic. At *best* you are evenly matched with this man. If you continue down the path you’re on he will see that he can do better than you. At your age and with your past, it will be difficult for you to find a man with an RMV over 5 that you can have an RP dynamic with.

**There are real stakes here and you can't afford to fuck it up any more than you already have.**

Now, how to turn things around? 

* Give us more specific information on what you are doing, what you are feeling in the moment, what happens immediately before you do X bad thing, and how both of you react. 

* If anger is a problem in general, what are you doing to regulate your moods? What are your outlets for when you feel bad in the moment? What are you doing to *prevent* feeling angry in the first place? 

* Brainstorm ideas on how you can realistically hold yourself accountable to your new standards.  

I also fully agree with everything /u/TempestTcup, /u/StingrayVC, /u/PhantomDream09, and /u/ThatStepfordGal have said, definitely reflect on their comments as you figure out what you need to do to improve. I’m so glad you’re back and hope you really commit to being a better woman and having a harmonious relationship <3

"Oh wow I can't even imagine what your elementary and middle school experiences were like, that sounds awful! So glad you were able to turn it around in HS; talent is definitely a great way to gain status. Do you know why your mom opted out of your town's FSM? I find it so interesting that this had a major effect on *your* status. It makes sense I just never considered it. I suppose I benefited from my own mom's status and even just watching her as I grew up. She is a social butterfly, very charismatic, popular, and an excellent hostess. I learned a lot from her in those areas both through intentional instruction and just by observing her. 

I agree you can definitely see the FSM in action within this little sphere of reddit. It's also very interesting to see it on other subreddits filled with women. I study a lot of the discussion on other subs and there's so much to glean about female social dynamics! When you look for it you can really see how much women are driven by the need to achieve consensus. I talk a lot with /u/PhantomDream09 about various posts and what they reveal about the FSM and female nature so I hope she takes a look at your comment!",2,FeminineNotFeminist

When it comes to makeup I do my regular look but add some shimmery eye shadow to really make everything pop. Or I'll wear a red lip for extra impact!

A few of us have referenced the Female Social Matrix (aka FSM) throughout the sub but it's so important that everyone understands these concepts. The mechanics behind how women interact plays a major role in the development and enforcement of beauty standards. This article also goes into how feminism is an effective sexual strategy for low value women who cannot compete in the sexual marketplace using their looks and personality.

I just had a thought that is really obvious in hindsight. The method chosen to spread his ideas pretty much makes sure that no one takes him seriously. All of those insightful arguments are associated with terrorism and insanity. I've had conversations where I organically weaved in a few points I gleaned from the essay and people agreed without hesitation. But if I were to go around in public citing The Unabomber they would be really uncomfortable and close their minds regardless of what was said.",10,The_Donald
Great point! I definitely see how that aspect could have been the result of programming.  ,4,The_Donald
"Have you read the Unabomber manifesto? It has a brilliant analysis of the current cultural issues facing the modern West. It's incredibly harsh on Leftism and brings up so many amazing points about human nature. The entire essay is available online (easily searchable) and even looking up terms like ""the power process"" would show just how well thought out these positions are. I really can't imagine a scenario where TPTB would want *that* information to be put out there for all to see. ",17,The_Donald
"It'd be really helpful  if you told us about your age, skin type, current routines, and any lifestyle factors that are relevant! 

I have normal skin (that can get dehydrated) and I just started using [this toner by Ole Henriksen](http://www.sephora.com/balancing-force-oil-control-toner-P416816) and it's been great for any hormonal breakouts. I've tried tons of different exfoliants and acne products but something about this formulation just really works for my skin. I use it most nights and wait a bit before putting on anything else to give the ingredients time to do their thing. I don't think it would be too harsh for anyone who isn't used to actives but I've been using chemical exfoliants for years so to me this seems super mild.

"M and I are so opposite! Our worldview and values are the same but the interests and hobbies we enjoy could not be more different. It's the result of our opposite personalities, he's I/ENTJ and intro traditionally masculine things (vintage cars, hunting, etc) and I'm ENFP and into all things beauty, art, and dance. 

It's actually really hard for us to find things to do together outside of our go to activities. Our one on one activities consist of watching mafia and crime films and going to the bar. We also usually have at least 1 show that we're watching together in our spare time. We make an awesome team at parties and events though, our natural strengths really complement each other! 

I definitely feel lonely sometimes but never ignored. I understand that he has a greater need for alone time than I do and it's on me to fill that time with something that makes me happy. ",2,RedPillWives

"Im sure M and I will go to one of our usual bars but my main thing this weekend is crafting my new diet and workout plan and buying things for my next phase of self improvement in general. I've set aside the remainder of May to prep and then June 1st is when things will really begin! 

When we go shopping this weekend I'm getting some new earrings, extra dark wash skinny jeans, tennis shoes (I don't own any), and foundation. 

We also cancelled Netflix so I have to finalize my list of all the shows that I want so that we can get started on acquiring them. I love rewatching episodes of my fav shows especially while cleaning or doing beauty activities. ",4,FeminineNotFeminist
"It's always great to see an RP concept explored in depth! The connection you've made between the male and female experience really underscores why humans have developed intricate systems and norms over the centuries when it comes to romance. Even something as simple as going on a proper date prior to having sex is a method of adding structure to prevent common pitfalls. The way we've organized as a species to address these innate tendencies is so awesome isn't it? 

The garden metaphor is so lovely (everything by CS Lewis is really) and it is so relevant to women today. It may sound boring to think about your goals and have standards for yourself and your man but these ""lifeless"" things will enable something beautiful! Women who aren't used to engaging in future oriented behaviour in their love lives probably imagine the worst when vetting gets brought up. But really these things can be incorporated into your life easily and it will feel organic in the moment. 

So I'd disagree with the idea that being ""cold"" is necessary but the spirit of that part is spot on. Some women need to learn that they can exercise agency and rationality without being boring or missing out on life. It's all about knowing what you want and then orienting yourself in that direction. 

I especially appreciate what you're saying about media representations of relationships. Movies and TV shows have been teaching audiences about reality basically from the start. I'm sure I mentioned The Last Psychiatrist to you but if you haven't checked out his archives do so asap! 

Your post highlights so many great things that will resonate with RPWs at any stage. A closer look at this bssic concept is just refreshing - thank you. I'm really excited to see the discussion this generates!

/u/StingrayVC and I are actually LH but I get what you're saying and thank you!,2,RedPillWives
">What our men want is submission (for the religious folks out there, this goes hand in hand with meekness, which means contained spirit. Think about that), deference, our whatever word you choose to use for it. They don't want a milquetoast they can't trust to make decisions. 

This is so key! You can be submissive and have a personality and spine! Having agency and being able to do things without someone holding your hand or constantly reassuring you are essential traits. I'm saying this from personal experience - like you said in your comment none of us are perfect. As an L woman I get moments of extreme insecurity and self doubt but you don't always need to act as you feel (if that makes sense). 

You bring up a great point about leaning on our men as necessary. This is something both H and L women should embrace. Let your man in, allow him to help you, it doesn't have to rest squarely on your shoulders! H women seem to struggle with being vulnerable and humble enough to ask for help whereas L women may be too indirect, shy, afraid, etc. I don't know where I'd be without M's help and guidance and it really warms my heart to see you saying the same thing about your husband. Your relationship has always been an inspiration to me and I'm sure everyone else feels the same way <3",3,RedPillWives
Isn't it so cool how different cultures have such varying preferences? But then underneath all of that the same underlying feminine features are preferred - we're all human after all. I'm a big fan of Asian skincare products but their aesthetic isn't my fav. Have you noticed that they are way more into neotony? Women even get surgery to look more juvenile! ,3,FeminineNotFeminist
"Why thank you! I actually used to feel a bit left out on this sub because a lot of the relationship content is geared towards HH and the lifestyle content seems to appeal best to LL women. I agree with what you're saying and hope that we can all explore the differences and strengths of HH, LH, LL, and HL women more on the sub and in IRC. ",2,RedPillWives
I always enjoy hearing about how your relationship works. You both are so logical and efficient! Hopefully women reading are encouraged to be more straightforward and honest about their emotions. It seems to be a common theme with L women that we can hide how we feel since we are conflict averse. You are an excellent example of how important it is to find the right man *for you*. When you are matched properly you can lean on your man without hesitation or worry!,2,RedPillWives
"It's awesome how similar all of the LH women's relationships are!

"SPOILERS DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU CARE ABOUT THAT

I was so excited when I started watching the show because they depict a lot of different relationship types in a realistic manner. Madeline was alpha widowed by her ex and in a dead bedroom situation with her BB Ed. Celeste didn't know how to deal with Perry's dominance and they had a twisted dynamic that deep down they both enjoyed. Renata and her husband were a dynamic duo, Bonnie had tamed Nathan and that relationship also worked well. I also really liked all the female social dynamic stuff that was included at the start. It all felt very RP. 

Pretty much every character let me down in some way as the show progressed and by the end of it I hated almost everyone. 

A story about two people struggling with rage issues and being the best spouse possible is *way* more interesting than what the Celeste and Perry story devolved into. They ended up checking off every cliche in the book and it saddens me that they transformed Perry into a evil monster to have a more ""satisfying"" ending. There was so much nuance to the story I thought they were telling initially so when they removed all shades of grey it was disappointing. I could go on about that story arc but I'll cut that particular rant off here for now. 

The reaction of the parents to the 16 year old auctioning her virginity online was the #2 thing that frustrated me the most. Nathan where were your balls?! They were way too calm and helpless when they should have been angry and taken charge. I know that this is the point, it just really bothered me! 

I also could not care less about Jane's rape story.

Loved the shot composition, music, wardrobe, soundtrack, and editing. I've seen it twice and added the soundtrack to my Spotify - perfect background music for lots of tasks! I'll definitely watch season 2! ",1,RedPillWives

"I actually disagree, the similarity between the images show exactly which features and/or qualities make a difference as you go up or down the spectrum. There are so many variables that go into attractiveness so keeping some things constant helps isolate the ones that distinguish a 4 from a 6 from a 9. /u/phantasmagnolia did an awesome breakdown of some of the differences between the faces. Are they minute? Sure, but that doesn't make it insignificant. There are clear patterns that line up with the underlying preferences most men have. ",1,FeminineNotFeminist
"I don't disagree with a lot that you're saying but I didn't intend for these images to be taken as definitive authorities on female beauty; I wanted us to dissect them and think about what they reveal about human preferences. I may be misinterpreting but your comment gave the impression that you thought these images were presented to show exactly what should be considered a 5, 7, 10, etc. Composites allow you to see the big picture and while the images don't account for every possible iteration of female beauty, they certainly provide insights that we can discuss as a community. For the purposes I intended I don't think that the lack of obvious differences is an issue. 

It's so cool how much of an impact subtle shifts in weight, bone structure, feature size, proportions, and ratios can have. It's not about presenting an exclusionary definition of beauty but rather zeroing in on certain aspects of beauty as presented in these images. It's easier to compare women who look similar vs women with wildly different characteristics. There are too many variables that impact how women are perceived so having some constants is helpful imo.

[I found Hot or Not composites of the most attractive women for different age groups!](http://media.boreme.com/post_media/2009/hot-or-not-composite-images-2-1.jpg) ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
"Love your analysis! I picked up on the same things as you and I see what you're saying about the less genuine smiles, the eyes also have a different feel in comparison to the women under 5. To add on to what you're saying about the differences in features:

* The defining trait that seems to push people to the below 4.5 category is being obese. These women aren't smiling as much probably because they are self conscious and embarrassed. They also wear less makeup, not that it would make a huge difference. 

* Between 4.5 and 5.5 the women look entirely unremarkable. I feel like the 5s have the most balanced of faces but beauty requires more than that. They are not exceptionally feminine or striking but there isn't anything wrong with their proportions. 

* 6 really gives off the girl next door vibe! I think its the tan and her smile. She looks so open and approachable. You should look at my comment to /u/littlegoosegirl to see some cool charts showing how different facial features are associated with different personality traits. 


I agree the Miss Universe composites are way hotter than any of the women in Hot or Not. The Africa photo is lovely isn't it? I don't think the fuller features would go away completely but I agree with you that they might be diminished a bit if even more women were included somehow. My favourite is the ""finalists"" but all of them are truly beautiful!",2,FeminineNotFeminist
"Yes I definitely wasn't trying to present these images as the be all end all when it comes to depicting female beauty! I think there's a lot to discuss both the areas that the images excel and provoke thought, and also the ways that they may be lacking. I kept a lot of my thoughts out of the post so that I didn't bias anyone, so I appreciate you bringing up this point! ",1,FeminineNotFeminist
"From what I understand Hot Or Not catered to a demo that was overwhelmingly middle class and below, and the people participating are mostly under 35. I think that makes the composites useful references for the average person curious to learn what people find attractive. Almost all women hit their peak SMV sometime between 16 and 25 and women over 25 are considered more attractive if they look youthful. The ethnic makeup of the site seems to be in line with the makeup of the US population at the time (this is an old image). I don’t get an overwhelmingly Latin vibe but I do see the influence of multiple groups; if you look at the composite image of the “Americas” in the second graphic, you can see that influence as well especially when compared to the European composite. I don’t think that it hurts anything in the Hot or Not composites, especially since the ideal look in America isn’t based 100% on any one group’s features. 

One thing that I think contributes to the perception that some lower ranking composites are more attractive is that the subtle shifts between each square affect more than how feminine or hot the women seem. [In this image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eanhW.png) you can see that bone structure, proportions, and ratios have a huge difference in how a woman is perceived. [They also did the same thing for men here.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TY84l.jpg). To be clear these are composites created after individuals ranked different photos on different traits. I wonder how much our assessments are impacted by subconscious judgements about the “personality” of the woman depicted. 

I completely agree that the paleness of the highest ranked woman is due to makeup and lighting. Her eyes are more defined which lends credence to that theory as well. 

>Honestly, past 8.5 most girls blur together in the ""really hot"" category, and those factors usually hinge on size of eyes and lips vs. size of nose and chin. 

Yep and that’s why I like this chart. It shows how women you’d see on a daily basis stack up. In real life - outside of big cities - there are not drop dead gorgeous people at every turn. The 1 - 10 scale is more subtle. 5-7s are not boring or ugly or undesirable. 8 - 10s  stand out of course but  they look more real here vs what you see depicted in magazines or on film. The Miss Universe photos also seem more realistic. Those women are gorgeous but you can definitely picture them as existing in real life. Perhaps this speaks to the level of editing and manipulation that is done to photos today, that composite images seem more realistic than what is offered lol 



Have you read my post on the characteristics of feminine beauty? I’ve also shared a few links on feminine bone structure and I have plenty more if you’re interested. Don’t want to be redundant if you’ve already taken a look but the end of your comment made it seem like you hadn’t read them so just let me know :)

"Great point! It's probably because Asians are too high achieving and don't really fit their victim narrative. Is there legitimate institutional racism that afflicts certain black populations? Absolutely! But that isn't what most SJWs and feminists care about at all and it's definitely not why most of those contestants were chosen. 

Just thinking out loud right now and connecting some dots between existing theories but I feel like black women are venerated so much by SJWS because black women are pretty much at the bottom of the list when it comes to status in the sexual marketplace and female social matrix.  There are so many factors as to why and that is a separate convo but feminism has definitely always been about evening the playing field between high value women and women with low value. (Obviously there are women of all backgrounds at every point on the ""value"" spectrum, I'm just speaking in general terms here.) If the competition was 100% about looks we'd see less diversity, but the black women who made it would have truly earned it. And leftists seem to be against fairly earning something.

"Ohh okay well I think that the majority of the population would embrace the lowered standards in a more extreme way that what we're seeing now. 

So I was thinking more about this subject last night and I feel like there are so many more ways to signal and and gain status than there were in the past. Because of the variety of outlets and options, I think the power of appearance has fallen significantly in a lot of circles. I see this as being connected to the idea of [""persona striving""](http://akinokure.blogspot.com/2015/11/persona-contests-next-development-in.html) vs ""lifestyle striving"" and ""career striving"". It's not about wearing the best outfits or looking awesome at all times (which would be more career and lifestyle status contests). Your appearance has to communicate the persona, and for a lot of people that means that there is less pressure to look put together in the traditional, mainstream way. Some personas require rejecting those norms outright, or rebelling against them. Others are about looking like you don't have time for anything, or like you can't ""adult"" properly. I'll flesh out the connection in a future post I think the gears are turning but I have more to think about!",4,FeminineNotFeminist

I do a lot of what you mentioned in the OP but a two of my preventative habits: 

*  Limiting stress is so key! I take naps, listen to guided meditation, listen to guided hypnosis stuff, drink wine, take baths, etc. A low stress life is key to staying young at heart. 

* Low sugar! If necessary in a recipe I'll use cane sugar but otherwise I sweeten everything with agave or honey. I'll also add some hazelnut syrup to my coffee but the sugar content there is super low. Not only is this good for your teeth it's great for your overall health and skin.

">I also believe that the simple habits we practice (such as grooming) affect us more than we expect. You know that old tip that says to ""make your bed first thing in the morning""? It seems pointless, but it nurtures a sense of productivity, encourages overall organization, and makes you feel welcome and just plain good when you get home. Same concept.

Agreed! I also think that focusing on your appearance helps develop femininity (in women). Patience, attention to detail, appreciation of beauty, gentleness, discipline, etc are some of the fruits that come from really devoting time and energy into looking great on a daily basis.

"Love this subject! I actually shortened my comment so that there can be more discussion, I definitely have more to say but want to have something more manageable to respond to :)

>Do you agree our personal standards have declined? If so, what would you indicate as the cause of the decline?

Yes the general standards for what is appropriate to wear in various contexts is way more casual today vs in the past. I read (and reread, and study) a lot of old etiquette books and their guidelines for dress reveal just how much things have changed. Of course I’m going to say that prole drift is a cause of the decline of personal standards but I have some other ideas as well:

* Improvements in technology make it easier for different types of clothing to be made and cared for. Synthetic fabrics lend themselves to all sorts of styles and they are cheaper, making them easier to obtain. 

* More variety in entertainment allows people to seek out the exact content they are interested in. This creates a bubble where people don’t have to feel judged for not meeting certain standards. For every possible niche there are online and offline communities and resources reinforcing those norms.

* There is less struggle in general so people are lazier and don’t feel as much pressure to present themselves nicely at all times. 

I agree with the second article when it says that people are primarily focused on their individual comfort and less concerned with other people or what is appropriate. This ties in really nicely with the “cocooning” theory written about extensively on akinokure. I have a particular blog post in mind so I’ll have to find it and link it here. 

>Do you think it becomes a self-fulfilling cycle? How might it affect our culture to hold ourselves and one another to lower standards?

I assume you mean higher standards? If we held everyone to even lower standards I think a lot of people would do the absolute bare minimum before leaving their homes.

I definitely think casual and/or inappropriate dress is reinforced by the media as well as individuals. So many in the public eye dress improperly for the given situation, which signals to audiences that this is an acceptable thing to do. Even youtube gurus promote dressing casually and skimpily to millions of women across the country. I’ve seen influencers slammed for looking “matronly”, “trying too hard”, “stuck up”, etc. just for wearing demure and/or professional dresses and skirts. All of these outside influences affect what is considered cool and normal within social groups, so it makes it harder for individual women to change if they want to avoid criticism or ridicule.

If we held everyone to higher standards I think there would be resistance at first but in the end everyone would benefit. I’m fortunate that where I grew up everyone dressed well, it really impacts how people carry themselves and act. 

>Are there any specific fashions or attitudes you think this has affected for the better?

No not off the top of my head! I’m totally open to hearing the positives though.

>Which direction do you see our relationship with fashion going in the next 5, 10, or 20 years?

I think in the next 5 years the divide will only get bigger between the two camps (traditional vs casual all the time). After that maybe we’ll see a return to normalcy in America as a whole and higher standards for appearance will come with that.

"Great point, there were definitely more attractive white women in the competition than the one who made it to the top 5. In my opinion Ms. Illinois is beautiful but the other minority women seem to only be there for political reasons. Of course pageants aren't 100% based on looks but do those women *really* have personalities so amazing that they beat the other objectively more beautiful women?

The woman who won looks attractive depending on the angle, her makeup, and fashion choices (which are often questionable looking at her instagram). There are several women who look consistently gorgeous, including other black women like Ms. Illinois.

"In a lot of ways my upbringing reinforced traditional values. I spent a lot of time in church (choir) and in dance classes, both activities that encouraged femininity, self discipline, and good character. I also wasn't allowed to watch much TV when young and never had one in my room. These things I'll definitely repeat with my own kids. Also my father is a very masculine and dominant man which is very important for the home.

There will be tons of changes as well, not all specifically aimed at instilling traditional values though.

"* **Skincare Product** - Definitely oil cleansing to remove makeup before using a regular cleanser. I've been doing it for a few years now and won't switch to any other method (unless something truly revolutionary comes out). Can't believe I was relying on makeup wipes for so long! 

* **Vitamin Supplements** - It's cliche but biotin really does help with hair growth, you just have to drink a lot of water when you take it.

* **Hair Care** - Roller setting! Such a great way to style your hair without using a lot of heat. I'm really fast at setting my hair now and I use my computer while under the dryer so it doesn't take any time out of my life really.

* **Makeup Technique** - Starting with my ""darkest darks"" so that I don't accidentally make my face too intense or unbalanced. My eyebrows are essentially black so those go on first, and it gives me a frame of reference for eyeshadow, and doing my eyes before blush ensures that I don't go overboard there either. If I wear red lipstick, that goes on first so that I don't make my eyebrows (or anything else) too harsh. Doing eyebrows, eyes, and/or red lips first also helps me not over apply base makeup because those colours take away focus from tiny flaws I would have fixated on otherwise. And that's how most people see me anyways so it allows me to have a lighter hand and look more seamless.

When I mix it in with my moisturizer I notice a difference but if I do it on its own (underneath moisturizer) it does nothing. No idea why, but I'm experimenting to see if I can get it to work as a single layer. If not I'll definitely use up the bottle but won't repurchase, will have to find an ampoule or similar hyaluronic acid serum/gel to replace it.

* Spraying mist in between different steps really helps my face feel ""full"". Locking in hydration is just so key. I love the One Love Organics Vitamin D mist and I'm excited about exploring the world of face mists! 

* I'm sheet masking more often - every other or every night. I love the Donkey Milk Aqua mask and I'll be getting some Whamisa masks and this one brand I saw on Sephora whos name is escaping me right now (maybe starts with a K...it has peptides).

">So, what are you thoughts about:

>The youtube personality deleting her video and using a new title?

I understand why she did it but I think it was a bad decision both from an ideological perspective and a business perspective. Her original title was the best one to appeal to the target audience. It had key words that would show up if someone did a Google search or searched on Youtube. And women absolutely are searching ""how to look sexy without being slutty"" or a variation of that query. The new title doesn't really speak to what women really want to know. Including the term ""slutty"" made it clear that she would show you the right way to present yourself to prevent others from forming the wrong opinion about you - male or female. ""Naked"" doesn't have the same layers of meaning.

>All the women talking about how 'slut' and similar language is a serious issue?

I don't care about their concerns and don't see why most people would either. As much as they say the stance is about freedom and equality, it really seems to be about hurt feelings and status in the FSM. Those who lead a lifestyle that is considered ""slutty"" by modern (or traditional) standards don't like that their choices are labeled as undesirable. And they don't like that women actively try to distinguish themselves from ""sluts"". They feel left out and they want to try to bully people into giving them higher status.The only non-sluts I've seen arguing against slut shaming are low RMV women who I can only assume look up to sluts because they at least are achieving *some* sort of success in the SMP. 



>Do you think words like slut, skank, and whore shouldn't be used?

Since the main idea against slut shaming is that women should have it as easy as possible in the SMP with few consequences, I can't say that I agree. The words are an important way for women (and men) to influence the actions of other women and maintain a balance in the system. When more women engage in slutty behaviour, it changes male expectations for other women and lowers the incentive for them to commit and/or stay committed. I think it's in the interest of nearly all women to enforce the idea that certain practices are inappropriate.

"I used to have a big problem gaining weight and then it turned out that I have Celiac's! I literally wasn't absorbing nutrients and going gluten free + taking steroids really turned that around. So my advice is to bring up your weight with your doctor just in case there is an underlying medical issue preventing you from gaining weight normally. Not that you have Celiac's but maybe there's another reason you've stalled. 

Maca powder can be added to food and smoothies or just mixed with water and that should definitely help with weight gain.",2,FeminineNotFeminist

"The love languages I prefer to receive vs use differ as well! I express my love through acts of service and words of affirmation but I prefer receiving physical touch and quality time. 

Maybe not everyone gives love in the way they want to receive it but I do think that a lot of women fail to recognise that their men prefer different love languages entirely. For example a lot of women enjoy providing acts of service for their men and they are hurt and confused when their men try to get them to take a break and do an activity with them (quality time). They assumed that the way they prefer to express love is the way their man prefers to receive love. I've also definitely seen women on this sub struggle with the idea that their idea of fun and/or romantic is not the same as their mans. 

Your unique situation definitely seems to have shielded you from these misunderstandings and that is so awesome. Women who find their man later in life have a lot more to adjust and relearn.

">Why would you call someone deliberately trying to wrong you by a neutral or even kind title?

This is such a great question. We have zero obligation to treat people with respect and kindness if they are actively doing something cruel to us. Stealing a woman's fiance (or husband!) has a devastating effect on the wronged woman. Who would expect her to remain perfectly happy at all times? Who would expect her to speak highly of the other woman? These are really unrealistic standards completely at odds with both human nature and female nature. If an individual woman desires to hold herself to this sort of standard cool but to apply this as a blanket rule to all women? 

Maybe we need to do a separate post about how there is a hierarchy of the different relationships we're involved in and each level receives different treatment. To echo your other comment, your SO gets treated better than your coworker, who gets treated better than a random stranger at the grocery store. And that stranger gets treated better than a different stranger who tries to rob you! The only person who should get 100% of your psychological femininity, submission/deference, GOFL-ness, etc is your man.

"This isn't /r/EmilyPost. It's great that you have a clear set of standards for your behaviour, but again, shaming someone for their use of the term ""skank"" in this instance is inappropriate.

Some women choose not to use ""bad words"", others refrain from drinking, and then there are women on the other side of the spectrum. Both types of women (and those in between) are able to use the information on RPW to improve their relationships. 

This doesn't mean that I don't think one should have standards when it comes to word choice.

If you are of average or higher RMV you shouldn't have any problem getting men who are actually available. Why waste time trying to convince someone who isn't on the market? More often than not doesn't the man just string the other woman along, dangling the promise of something more in front of her? And if he does leave his woman, do you really want to deal with that drama and the baggage he will definitely have? Also can you really trust a man who you got together with via and affair?

When it comes to bringing up something your man is wrong about I feel like you have to consider his personality and how important the topic in question is. Does it really matter what the nutritional value of iceberg lettuce is? No, so you probably don't need to correct him. A woman who constantly has to fact check and nit pick her man's statements would get annoying very quickly. 

However if it's something that *actually* matters then you'd have to pick the right timing and method of telling him. This varies from man to man and woman to woman. Some broad guidelines would be not bringing up something that would upset/angry him when he is already upset/angry/stressed or when he is enjoying himself. Also tone, facial expressions, body language, and word choice are key. You'd never want to imply that your man was an idiot for being wrong about X.

A lot of people refuse to engage in debate regarding cultural appropriation and just dismiss any sort of argument as offensive. I think it'd be more interesting to discuss the actual justifications behind various positions instead of just attacking those who disagree. 

Let's look at your response to me and assume that I was in fact asking you those qs instead of using them as a rhetorical device. If someone asks a question about *why* something is offensive, then replying ""can you not see the offensiveness in that"" and ""come on that can't be serious"" isn't the best way to show it to them. You have to make a case. You haven't proven anything except for my point that valid avenues of discussion are closed off when it lefitsts get uncomfortable.

You bring up some great questions regarding ""white feminism"". They are so black and white and I honestly don't think they even consider alternate perspective and nuances before deciding on positions. I think a legitimate criticism of feminism as practiced by white women initially would be the promotion of female empowerment in the workplace which took many white women out of their homes and then homemaking jobs were outsourced to minorities. Nannies, house cleaning services, etc. But I'm not criticizing this from a leftist perspective - I wish that women didn't enter the male sphere en masse at all! That being said I can definitely see the merits to the argument that ""white feminists"" live in a bubble - they do. But so do black women (and other minorities) who have time to be intersectional feminists and/or in BLM. Basically I feel like there is a sliver of truth that they are touching on but I can't stand by the arguments themselves or the proposed solutions. 

>It's pretty interesting how controlling mods can become. Belligerent intolerance is always ugly, even when it's under the guise of tolerance... But I don't think this is restricted to the left. Groupthink is a problem on a lot of forums, and there are a number of ""right"" subreddits that are equally intolerant of commenters that do not toe the line regarding that subreddit's specific flavor of groupthink.

Agreed. There is a difference between having a specific focus to the subreddit and censorship. Some subs are explicitly about positive discussion towards X, like The_Donald and I think that's great because it's clear in the rules and it's literally the purpose of the sub. Their focus is more limited, but even then there are robust discussions and debates within the comments. I do see groupthink on that sub but actually not when it comes to conservative issues - there are a lot of liberal stances that many people assume everyone shares. The presence of these positions within the greater community only underscores the fact that differences of opinion are welcome on the sub. I think anyone who bashes T_D for censorship doesn't read it regularly. I also think there is a tendency for non conservatives to label a group of conservatives who (mostly) agree as a circlejerk, close minded, etc. regardless of the degree of actual closed-mindedness (and then there's an assumption that being ""open minded"" is superior!). In contrast many of the beauty communities claim to be for everyone, people routinely are encouraged to share alternate opinions, but then anything that goes against the grain is punished.

The instagram look (and most noticeable makeup looks) are sexy when done right because they exaggerate signs of sexual maturity. Of course men like it!

Just looking at what you're proposing, I could ask: 

* Why should someone who isn't part of a specific religion should adhere to the rules of that religion? Why should out-groupers imbue objects, symbols, and practices with the exact same significance as in-group members? Why can't they form their own relationship with said symbol/object/practice?

* If an individual chooses not to insult or annoy a specific friend/coworker/neighbor/etc but otherwise wears whatever would be considered offensive in a situation where no one is around to be offended - does it matter? Can something be inherently disrespectful or does disrespect require the presence of a wronged party? 

* How much of an influence should complete strangers who we'd never interact with have on our wardrobe choices and overall look? Should people refrain from posting photos to social media on the off chance that they'd offend someone who happened upon their profile?

"Everything that you said is so great I can't even add to it you really hit the nail on the head! I'd love to hear your thoughts after you actually read the comments, some of them are especially hilarious/horrifying. 

>ake a statement like ""cultural appropriation is bad"", then underneath it branch into ""agree"" or ""disagree"". Yes, they engage in debate and take different positions - but it all falls under the branch of ""agree""; they may not see eye-to-eye on their solutions, or interpretations of the issues, or what have you - but they cannot engage with anything that falls under the entire branch of ""disagree"". Anybody operating under that branch of perspective is immediately demonized and labeled as a racist/misogynist/other buzzword.

This part really sucks because I think there are interesting conversations to be had in the ""disagree"" camp. For example questioning the definition of cultural appropriation itself - when is it real, if at all? Another question: how many people's feelings do you have to consider before making a decision about what to wear? I fully understand the desire to appeal to your family, friends, and individuals in your immediate sphere (e.g. office, guests at a party, etc.) but if there aren't any people who would be offended by what you're wearing, shouldn't that be factored into the equation? There was a women in the BGC comments who did not wear traditional Indian dress to an event she was invited to because she was worried about offending anyone. She had the explicit permission of the Indians who would be there, who wanted her to wear the clothing, but she was terrified of going against SJW morals and ""appropriating"" their culture. Why do the feelings of hypothetical strangers matter more than the feelings of people you know and care about? This goes back to what I was saying about pathological altruism + the left.

Absolutely! I'd never claim to be open minded or tolerant but I definitely love exploring ideas and hearing the perspectives of others. I had a lovely exchange with /u/SunflowerHacker in this very thread and we were both able to learn from each other (I'd like to think lol).

>Do I think racism/sexism should be acceptable in our legal processes? Absolutely not. I used to cite many statistics and studies (without reading the actual studies and how they were conducted) and was convinced that systemic oppression was rampant in this country. Then I took a closer look at how certain organizations arrived at those numbers, and things began to fall apart.

It's always good to challenge our beliefs and do first hand research instead of just believing what we hear. I think there is systemic oppression but not in the way that leftists argue. One example would be the treatment of poor blacks - the welfare program, Hollywood, music industry, and prison system all contribute to a terrible culture that really reduces their chances of advancing and succeeding through legitimate paths. Another example is the way the IRS is used to target conservatives who are a threat to the Establishment. 

I'm with you not a fan of too much centralized power, but I'm so glad the tide seems to be turning after this most recent election. I want American culture restored!

>People can be rude, but just skim past those posts and move on, no need to over think it..

I feel like you're misinterpreting my mood and intentions when making this post. Seeing the type of interactions that I mentioned in the OP is off putting to those who don't agree with the intersectional feminist stance on the subject. Multiple beauty communities are pushing women away and labeling differences of thought as hatred, racism, oppression, etc. Even women who are on the same team aren't safe from this. My post is using the once incident to show the bigger picture. I wanted to discuss something that bothered me with a group of women who would get it. And note that when I say ""bothered"" I don't mean that I am personally hurt or offended by anything; this is about ideology and culture.

>Some things though do need to be brought up, some people live in isolation with other people just like themselves, here in an open online forum, there's many people from all over.
>Where's a better place to learn then here?

Sorry I'm not sure how that ties into anything? White women who asked how they can learn what to say vs not say were yelled at. The main line of thought presented was that minorities are not obligated to teach their oppressors how to not oppress. 

The internet is so great because of the way ideas can be exchanged but when subreddits that are supposed to be about a non political subject infuse all sorts of politics into everyday conversations, it's only natural that those who are mistreated for expressing disagreement/alternative thoughts create their own communities. Which again is why I am very grateful for this subreddit. Sometimes I just want to talk about makeup or fashion and that's it! And if I want to talk about something political/ideological, I'd rather not get tons of downvotes, insults, PMs, etc. 

Hope that all makes sense!

LOL! ,6,FeminineNotFeminist
"My post is specifically about how real world issues are affecting online spaces that aren't supposed to be about those real world issues. The whole point is that while women are invited to ""post any thought that pops into their heads"" those who express certain ideas are then downvoted, argued with, insulted, and even have their posts removed. I can take issue with this and I can also take issue with the ideas and word choice used by women on the other side of the aisle. 

>IRL if someone said something they didn't know was racist, I'd ask them ""what do you mean"" (with a smile), I'd draw them into discussion and have a worthwhile conversation. On the internet people don't do that.

You might do that and that is fine. Not everyone would but fortunately I don't live in an area where I have to interact with those types of people. And I pretty much always patiently engage with whoever comments to me, regardless of our differences. That's not relevant though, I can state how I feel about what I observe regardless of whether the incident in question is online or offline. 

>Don't take the internet for real life.

The people who submit content to reddit are real people who believe what they say. Their words have an effect on those reading, they don't exist in a vacuum. If you read the thread there are women who are legitimately distressed; the women championing for intersectional feminism certainly don't think that their actions exist outside of real life. 

2016 and 2017 have shown exactly how much of an impact interactions on the internet can have on the physical world. I don't think you can draw such a harsh line to divide the two anymore. ",3,FeminineNotFeminist

>All atrocities committed by civilizations of races/cultures other than white people are normally not up for discussion. That would be racist.

The fact that this happens really makes it clear how leftism is more about being anti white and anti Western civilization instead of equality, brotherhood, and other liberal values they proclaim. 

>This is just me venting now, but what's up with the ""white people have no culture"" meme? ...I swear to God, I've seen people who unironically say this all the time, then plaster my facebook feed with pics of them backpacking all over Europe on their (oppressed) parent's dime.

Hahaha right?! This is a real problem though and I hope that people start arguing against this terrible line of thinking. The idea that white people are neutral/nothing really bothers me. We see it in terms like ""people of color""...everyone has a color. Or when minority groups are referred to as ""ethnic"" e.g. the black hair section of the beauty aisle is labeled the ""ethnic"" section. EVERYONE has an ethnicity! You can't have more or less of an ethnicity! Haha guess I needed to vent along with you :)

* This is 2010s but in college I followed all the Southern Prep trends that appealed to me at the time.

I've always been a big believer in investing in skincare especially when it comes to treatments. Having single ingredient/purpose products is a great idea in theory but I don't think The Ordinary has formulations that can compete with other brands. A lot of Asian skincare brands have a similar approach but their formulas are better for some reason I haven't investigated the specifics.

"This write up is phenomenal! I don’t think I’ve ever read a more in depth analysis of the Disney princesses - and this is only part 1! So excited for future posts within this series (or the sequel if there’s just one more left). 

The part I found most interesting is just how well each princess conforms to the ideal woman of the time period the film was released in. It’s when you not something I ever picked up on but your photo and video/audio comparisons make it abundantly clear that this was an intentional choice by Disney. It’s actually brilliant how well they married the aesthetic of the fictional setting with contemporary trends. I especially enjoyed hearing the similarities between Snow White and the real life singer! The vibrato in both of their voices is a treat to listen to, thank you for sharing that :)

What I noticed when comparing the “realistic” drawings to the animation stills is that none of the princesses have pronounced noses! When the artist(s) added noses it really changed the faces, often making the women seem more mature since larger noses = more yang. I think Belle and Jane had the best nose illustrations out of everyone; but in the films those two had more visible noses than say, Snow White. 

With this post you’ve essentially proven without a doubt that the Disney women are not all carbon copies with no personality. I really hate that complaint and feel like the women repeating this myth are just lumping all attractive women into the same box. As much as these types of women claim to love diversity, they fail to notice the very real differences between each character. One thing that does make the women seem similar is the fact that they all have very feminine features and ratios, regardless of Kibbe type. I don’t think this is a bad thing at all. Why should anyone be upset about having a visually pleasing main character/romantic lead? 

The animation artists did such a great job translating each woman’s personality into her appearance, movements and expressions. I really appreciate that you took the time to collect all of the gifs and images. The comparison between Ariel’s hair and Pocahontas’ was a great way of highlighting the attention to detail that went into the design of every princes. I agree with you that the hair is almost like it’s own character!  

I’m really honoured that you included the Kibbe categories from our discussion on the subject earlier. Your point at the end about how the ability to type them means that these women aren’t too far off from real women is eye opening. I also feel like it underscores that Kibbe identified underlying patterns that are universal across women. Certain features just go together and create a specific look.

I agree with you that the hair is almost like it’s own character!  

I’m really honoured that you included the Kibbe categories from our discussion on the subject earlier. Your point at the end about how the ability to type them means that these women aren’t too far off from real women is eye opening. I also feel like it underscores that Kibbe identified underlying patterns that are universal across women. Certain features just go together and create a specific look. 

This entire post was really fun to read through and now I want to watch some Disney films haha! Thank you so so much for sharing this with the community <3

"Yay you took the test! 

I totally see the B influence, I feel like if DC ends up not working you could be in the Natural family (since B = blunt/broad yang). A lot of women end up choosing C or D because it's hard to tell traits apart and those two feel safer/easier/more inclusive. [This collage has women who are DC](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fe/dc/f8/fedcf8c2bce1260eb29b5813cbf64bd0.jpg), personally I think they're a bit more angular than you, but I only have the 1 photo to go by so please don't let me change your mind if you're really happy in DC. There are at least 4 women that look similar enough to you so perhaps the angularity of the more recognizable DCs shouldn't be our main metric. 

Here are some [Naturals](http://getthelook.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NATURAL_twarze1.jpg) I think these women have similar ratios to you! What do you think?",5,FeminineNotFeminist

It wouldn't be surprising if you were a soft classic, look at how many Cs you have. Are you sure all of your Ds are accurate?

>I'm getting curious as to how this can dictate styling... do I make myself look like what I am, make my favorite features look like what they are and try to make my less favorite features look the way I would prefer?

[Have you read this post yet?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FeminineNotFeminist/comments/5saqva/how_to_choose_the_right_type_of_clothing_based_on/) Kibbe basically groups people with the same features and builds and then the suggestions are about highlighting the assets and avoiding unflattering outfits. The suggestions that Kibbe gives are in line with the post I wrote but he has great insights for each family that go beyond my post (since that one has an individual focus). Essentially your wardrobe, hair, and makeup choices need to harmonize with your features. So if you are very yin and low contrast, your clothing should be yin and low contrast. If you are high contrast, mostly yang, then your clothing needs to be the same. In the next post I'll talk about yin vs yang and contrast vs blended when it comes to your wardrobe choices. Everything from necklines to patterns can be assessed in terms of those factors. 
",2,FeminineNotFeminist
"Love every single one of these suggestions!! I really can't stress enough how important it is to write down your answers. It definitely matters *which* features are more yin vs yang, not just the total amount of yin or yang in your entire body. 

So glad you enjoyed the post, thank you for commenting <3",2,FeminineNotFeminist
"When you PMed me about being an SG I immediately rejected it because I 100% remember seeing yang within your face and SGs have more delicate features. This is why I thought SN, it mixes blunt yang with yin. But then as I was rereading my post last night, I looked at Tina Turner and Liza Minelli and I feel like you fit in with those gals better than the SNs. FGs have yang and yin of course since Gamine is all about combining opposites. It also works very nicely with you being DYT type 4 (so did SN for the record) and I think your secondary is probably 3 but it could be 1, definitely something more high energy to go with your Gamine status. There will be a DYT + Kibbe post eventually. 

I'm going to write about this in the next post but there are 3 aspects of Kibbe types. The most important is the actual body type which is determined based on the ratio of yin to yang and contrast vs blended. [I wrote in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FeminineNotFeminist/comments/5saqva/how_to_choose_the_right_type_of_clothing_based_on/) about how to identify the nature of your features and dress them. Kibbe basically takes the traits I discussed and puts women in different boxes based on similarities. I feel like 80% of women in any given type are going to align with the persona that goes along with it. And then 80% of *those* women are going to align with the style that Kibbe describes. Even though the majority of women will fall in line completely with Kibbe's descriptions in every way, the only requirement to be a certain type is having the right features, ratios, and proportions. 

An entire community has developed around Kibbe and women have been expanding on his ideas and some new systems have even been invented trying to change/improve Kibbe. This coupled with the fact that a lot of info online about Kibbe is very dated (e.g. lookbooks from the mid 2000s) makes it harder to parse out what is mandatory/real/official vs what is personal opinion vs what is completely wrong. 

Like I said before you can have any style regardless of your Kibbe type. Audrey Hepburn and Tina Turner are both FGs. Because they are different people they are going to gravitate towards different looks. There are a lot of factors other than Kibbe type that contribute to what looks good on someone and I feel like there is some female solipsism at work in the wardrobe community that prevents women from seeing the variety and diversity within each type. It's also just easier to stick to stereotypes and shorthand. Naturals aren't all hippies but if you look at some sites it totally looks that way! Just like how SGs can seem like overgrown children haha

I hope this helps but if I can clarify anything else please let me know!",3,FeminineNotFeminist
"Even celebrities who look really similar aren't in the same Kibbe type, and it's hard to pin down some modern celebrities because there are tons of factors that go into why their wear a certain look. They are never purely seeking to flatter their natural features. Kibbe has not officially said anything about either women that you mentioned but the consensus (from my brief online search) is that Emma Watson is in the Gamine family. And Natalie Portman is either a Classic or a Dramatic Classic. Like I said in my earlier post, you may in fact be a Classic. It all depends on which features you picked for A and E, it's not only about the final tally. At the moment I can't think of a similar, modern celebrity who is a Classic other than Kate Middleton but maybe that helps you? Make sure you took the test accurately - use a mirror! Sometimes our mental image is off a bit. ",3,FeminineNotFeminist
"Thank you! 

So I kind of remember what you look like and you absolutely struck me as part of the Natural family. You can't be halfway between Gamine and Natural that doesn't make sense. What do you mean your style is more Gamine? The necklines, lengths, construction, patterns, etc? Or do you mean the stereotypical Gamine style, which isn't tied to the Kibbe type? Also I thought you were DYT type 4? Id be very surprised if you were one of the gamines and Type 4 - what was your secondary DYT type? 

I'm looking through this blog post now but right off the bat my first impression is that this idea is retarded. I hate when people over complicate and add on to the Kibbe system. I'll have a longer response once I finish and dissect the post - it may even be it's own post actually since I wrote another comment about a specific add on to the 12 types (ingenue).

"You're definitely a Gamine but don't forget, the personal style aspect can be seperated from the Kibbe type. Not all FGs borrow from the boys, and SGs don't have to be really twee or vintage inspired! 

As far as your edit goes, you are a combination of opposites which is reflected in the A, C, and D responses (assuming you answered accurately, based on my memory of you it should be A, D, and E, with some Cs). This is why I like for people to write things out, they can see how their features relate to one another. A is sharp yang, B is blunt yang, C is balanced, D is like small/petite yin, and E is like lush yin. You have both yin and yang in equal measure and you are high contrast (which we know just by looking at you). So that means you have both strong yin and strong yang features throughout, not middle of the road features. Does that make sense?

P.S. TRs don't have Yang bodies, they have slight Yang bone structure but they are thoroughly Yin, and therefore in the Romantic family. It might sound like semantics but I don't want anyone to get confused and I can't imagine why the person who typed up the test would be so general like that. ",2,FeminineNotFeminist
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!,2,FeminineNotFeminist
"I was saving this idea for a future post but I really really hate the Ingenue category, as well as all the other “corrections” people have made to the original Kibbe system. 

First, let me tell you that if you answered mostly D and E with some As then you are either a Romantic or a Theatrical Romantic. I encourage women to write down each answer so that they can really see how their features fall on the spectrum of yin, yang, contrast and blended. You have mostly yin and lower contrast - which is in the R family. Whether you are an R or a TR depends on which features you marked as A, but everything that you shared about your style seems squarely in the TR camp. 

There are a few reasons why I hate the Ingenue type as a concept:

* It ignores the variety and diversity that is present within each Kibbe family. Audrey Hepburn looks nothing like Tina Turner but the are both FGs. Some Romantics are going to have fewer As than others, some might even have Bs or Cs thrown in - that doesn’t mean they’re in the wrong category. 

* It conflates personal style and body type to an unreasonable degree. Even though there are personas given with each Kibbe type, you can have any type of style no matter what you are. Michelle Dockery is constantly mistyped as a Dramatic Classic because she has a more “classic” style. Scarlett Johansson is a Soft Natural but her personal style is very sensual and so she gets mistyped as Romantic. Drew Barrymore is apparently a Romantic but many would have pegged her for some type of Natural. Ingenue seems to be used by people who want to be extremely girly in their style, not realising that they can choose the colours and cuts that give this impression if they are SG, TR, or R. 

* It reinforces the misconception that TR is always super sexy and intense. I’m a TR myself and I get really annoyed looking around the wardrobe planning community and seeing things that are more “theatrical” and completely ignoring the romantic part. You don’t need a different Kibbe type to have “fitted skirts, defined waists, pencil skirts with ruffles, bow details, more delicate jewelry and slightly toned-down sex appeal with slightly rounder, ""cuter"" features”. This is literally part of the definition of TR (again I was planning on going into fashion in a future post but [here is a great resource](http://www.seasonalcolor.yuku.com/topic/1988/Kibbes-Theatrical-Romantic)).

I have a few more abstract points but I’ll save them for the next post :)

",2,FeminineNotFeminist
"Yeah you definitely have to write down every answer so that you can see how your features relate to each other. Being petite shouldn't throw you off too much - you have to compare yourself to other women, not to you at a larger weight. If you look at yourself and look at other women, how angular are you? If your hands are narrow and dainty then that's what they are...""but they are also small because I'm small"" doesn't come into play. You have small hands lol! There are plenty of short women who don't seem short in photos, ask around if you can't assess that aspect of yourself objectively.

"That's what the test is for! I just put all the explanation before the test so that women don't just zero in on their type.

"So glad you enjoyed the post!

I don't think that ""working backwards"" is an effective way to type yourself for several reasons:

* There is a lot of overlap when it comes to what each type can wear (or not wear). With seasonal colour analysis, every colour is definitively in a specific palette. This doesn't apply to Kibbe. The same shirt, dress, or necklace, could be worn by different Kibbe types, and flatter them. There are too many factors to definitively say that X neckline *only* works for Y type. 

* It is easy even for an untrained person to tell which shades work for them when they are being draped/have the colour next to their body in some way. If a woman has no idea about fashion and tries on a dress but thinks she looks bad, she isn't likely to understand *why* it looks bad. Is it the length, waistline, construction, materials, texture, sleeve length, pattern size, pattern definition, pattern type, neckline, a combination, etc? 

* It is harder for a lot of people to differentiate between personal preference and genuinely unflattering items. If you hate tulip skirts you might think they are unflattering, and rule out Theatrical Romantic. The reverse applies as well, you could be really into a specific style or clothing type and not realise that it looks unflattering!

But even if we assume that a woman is able to specifically identify the exact cuts that work and don't work for her - with the proper terminology and everything. Is this same women unable to look at her body and accurately answer the questions on the quizzes I linked? Can she not determine if her eyes are large or small? Or the length of her arms?  

The only time I think that using clothes works is if you are stuck between two similar types. For example if you can't figure out if you are DC or C, trying on clothing for both can make it clear. This works for different families too - SD vs TR, SN vs SC, D vs FN, etc.

"Fun question! 

Apparently skinny jeans aren't cool anymore? I will literally never wear any other type of pant! I've been wearing them for about 10 years now and cannot imagine any other cut.

I also really love bustier style tops. These were in style one year but I've been wearing them for ages, they just really flatter me and don't look hyper sexual if you pick the right material, cut, colour/print, etc.

Finally I'd say that the way I wear my blush isn't in style at all but it's what flatters me the best.

"My point about high profile MUAs, fashion editors, etc. wasn’t about skill vs no skill (which is their claim) I was speaking to the larger power struggle that is happening. So many women are seeing their influence diminish as the instagram and Youtube stars take over. They retaliate by pointing out the lack of knowledge and talent, but this is their method of trying to gain back status. They want audiences to judge beauty gurus through a lens that will make the old guard appear superior. I see the criticisms against the baddie look as a similar way for them to assert their status. If they strongly oppose the look it signals that they have taste and know their craft, it also gives them a stake in controlling the narrative. I think the cultural appropriation claim is a specific way to shame and assert dominance over the competition. How does anyone who buys into leftist morality defend against that? Now I don’t believe that every single woman (or man) is intentionally carrying out schemes, just that their subconscious urges and jealousies are contributing to their actions.

"Are the women being marketed to actually in hard economic times? I think it makes sense for companies to promote these trends. It takes WAY more products to look like a baddie than it does to look subtly enhanced. Please correct me if I am wrong but this trend seems to be aimed at 15-25 year old middle class and upper middle class women. So their budgets are a bit freer due to not having children and these are women who use social media and are more likely to go out to bars and clubs. You definitely need to do your makeup differently when you are being photographed, and a lot of the baddie techniques help with longevity as well. There is a really strong hip hop influence in the clubs in major cities so it makes sense that this would carry over into the makeup looks.All of this is just off the top of my head I think you posed a very interesting question! To sum up my answer: I don't think it's unethical of companies to identify a need and fill it. I do think they are creating a need as well and while I'm not a fan of prole drift, the market clearly is in support of these trends (or was, since as you pointed out it's going out of style!).",3,FeminineNotFeminist
"I do not think that white women are intentionally setting out to copy the features of other ethnicities. I think that they are using makeup and fashion to play up sexual characteristics that are more noticeable in other groups due to either biology or cultural differences. 

As I said before, all the features are indicators of sexual maturity and availability. It’s not about copying any other group specifically and really no one group owns large butts or plump lips. There are so many different and unrelated types of women who can have these traits, you can’t lump Western Asian, northern African, and Latina women together just because they aren’t white. The world isn’t white vs everyone else. Also there are *plenty* of white women who have extremely feminine features (both of the sexually mature and neotenous varieties). This goes back to what I was saying about the way that the reality of white ethnic groups and cultures is either denied or demonized. 

As you go down the socioeconomic ladder it becomes more acceptable to be overtly sexual with your appearance in a wider variety of locations. Upper middle class and up adult black and latina women do not have their bodies on display on a regular basis, and they do not wear the makeup techniques that are popular on instagram. These aesthetic codes are the result of class not ethnic background.

Further evidence that it isn’t about stealing definitive traits of minorities - white women aren’t giving themselves monolids or making their noses look wide and flat. They aren’t growing their hair down to their knees or rocking afros. None of those things are about looking sexier and/or cooler, so they don’t catch on!

>I am not sure how I implied that these looks have to be restricted to certain women. 

You’re entire argument seemed to be that white women should not wear anything close to the “baddie” look because it was cultural appropriation. “This type of look is extremely flattering for women of some ethnicities, and that is who it is meant for.” < - Direct quote from your blog post. I disagree with the idea that the look is “extremely flattering” on anyone or that it is “meant for” anyone! I have zero problem with women of any background wearing their makeup like this, they’re just going to look low rent lol.

>The point I was trying (and apparently, failing, lmao) to make is that I think it is disingenuous to the self to try to force yourself to look a certain way just because celebs do it or just because it's on Instagram when either you dislike it, or it just doesn't work for you. 

You can make this point without dragging race into the discussion though. Plenty of people within the beauty community make the claim that the trend is cultural appropriation, and everyone agrees with those people. But they are perpetuating a leftist myth! Just because enough people say it doesn’t make it true. People on the left love to make everything about race and oppression. They also completely deny the biological differences between race and gender so I’m not even sure that it would occur to them that dark lashes + plump lips + duskier skin = sexually mature. They also don’t seem to remember all of the times throughout history where it was perfectly normal for white women to do things like contour, have heavy eye makeup, etc. and it was *never* considered racially motivated. It’s also really taboo these days to mention class if it’s about anything other than the oppression of the poor by the elite.

>In all, I really wanted to encourage some to step outside what is popular at the moment, and embrace their own features - I repeatedly see women looking, well, not so great due to them attempting to embrace this trend and it just not working.

This is a valid discussion to have, but shaming people for cultural appropriation is a terrible way to go about it haha. Poor skill and lack of knowledge are absolutely issues that should be addressed. Although most women will have to take steps to look more feminine and it does involve making their lips look larger, or altering their bone structure via creams and powders. As far as what you said about women not thinking about things in biological terms, nearly every youtube tutorial talks about how sexy the look is so it’s clear that they implicitly understand the overall effect.

Re: Glossier, I have a love/hate relationship with Into The Gloss but I absolutely cannot stand the makeup brand! I agree with your criticism about their ingredients and brand philosophy and I think that the majority of the fans try way too hard to seem ~cool~ and ~effortless~.

------------------------------

>Why do you feel most women are incapable of determining this? Do you believe that biological instinct has faded, or that people ignore it? 

I could write a whole book about this there are too many answers haha here are just a few off the top of my head:

* There is less pressure to put effort into your appearance due to how casual things are today. Not just in terms of dress code but the way people interact, the lifestyles women lead, the more open and fluid sexual market place, etc. 

* Leftism has changed people’s values. Subjectivity and emotions trump objectivity and reason. Beauty is considered either irrelevant, oppressive, or up to each individual’s judgement.

* The internet makes it easy to stay in your bubble and so if you aren’t interested in fashion at all it is easy to avoid learning how to dress yourself attractively. Additionally the internet shortens the fashion cycle, it’s all about trends and staying current not about developing a unique and personal look.

* The [cocooning phase](http://akinokure.blogspot.com/2013/02/cocoonings-web-of-mental-dysfunction.html) that we are in now [encourages attention seeking behaviour](http://akinokure.blogspot.com/2012/01/getting-attention-vs-being-popular.html) which prevents actual introspection and growth.

* [The erosion of the nuclear family and local community](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/) prevent tons of women from being guided by their parents and other adult role models. These adult women aren’t able to pass down their wisdom when it comes to beauty.

* Adult women are divorcing and/or not getting married and/or being cheating sluts and are on the market and not reinvesting into the female community as described earlier.

* Middle class women have more income, free time, and information at their disposal but they do not have the ability to synthesize and act on the beauty advice and information they absorb as effectively as they want to. This is due to lack of confidence, lack of practice, and lack of existing examples. For example I have a theory that tons of women on reddit are at a loss at how to dress professionally because they didn’t grow up watching their mothers get ready for a business professional job environment or formal events.

* Technology removes a lot of the pressures that caused us to develop our biological traits and instincts, so it makes sense that we’d lose touch as we get further away from primal existence.

>On the subject of ""Insta baddie"" I think this is not a beauty standard but only a trend

I think it’s a beauty standard for proles and a trend for non proles. I also think that women who were “baddies” prior to it being popular may feel that it’s about race because they don’t see the bigger picture. They also would not be familiar with the term “prole drift”. They don’t like that something once mocked is now cool, it makes sense.

"I'm actually starting a blog soon that will mostly be about beauty, class, and the female social matrix (both individually and all the ways they intersect) because I have SO MUCH to say on these subjects! Prole drift is definitely one way that ideas, customs, and trends spread across society, but you're right that lower classes emulating higher classes occurs too. Each level in the hierarchy has it's own standards, codes, values, worldviews, etc. so it's not like everyone at the bottom is desperate to be exactly like those at the top. Often people borrow from other classes as a way signal to and gain status amongst their peers (instead of trying to climb or descend the ladder). It's really interesting to look at how trends and styles change over time and which direction things move and why.

"Thank you! I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on my comment as well, there isn't nearly enough honest conversation about class in the beauty community. ",2,FeminineNotFeminist
"I agree with you that there are a ton of people within the beauty community who vilify those that wear the baddie look, I just also disagree with a lot of their criticism even though I don't like the look either. It's difficult to have conversations about the subject when everyone isn't on the same page and has their own biases and beliefs. There are tons of instances of people within the makeup community voicing their dislike of the trendy instagram look however if you examine what they say and who they are, you'd see all the other factors at play.

There are so many conflicts wrapped into the discussion. A big one is older generations vs younger generations - what is trendy today isn't understood by a lot of people over 35. And then there is the ongoing battle between professional makeup artists and women who are popular without any credentials. I've seen a lot of really great concerns raised about the way youtube and instagram gurus are changing the beauty community in a way that disadvantages professional makeup artists. Proper theory, techniques, and methods are disregarded and personality is elevated over skill. This is also connected to the generation battle because a lot of women are losing their place in the hierarchy since younger, trendier, women are more popular. I will have to find it but there was this piece in Vogue (I think) that was belitting fashion bloggers and instagram models and saying they don't compare to the contributors to real fashion magazines. While I agree with that sentiment the insecurity of women who see their influence slipping can't be ignored. 

Going back to cultural appropriation, I think that making things about ethnicity complicates both the actual issue and our ideas about race in general. The argument that so many make is that because black women wore the baddie look and now white women are wearing it, white women are in the wrong and **black women should be the only women wearing it because it is meant for them.** I see so many people are quick to tear down white women but it's apparently not okay to say that you don't like this look AT ALL or *especially* on black women/minorities. 

So we can say that white women look slutty, trashy, masculine, ugly, aggressive, stupid, ridiculous, like trannies, etc. but if it's a black woman all of a sudden she is ""fierce"", ""empowered"", ""expressing herself"", ""staying true to her culture"", etc. Any of the negative words used on white women are considered racist if applied to black women, and if someone says what everyone is thinking - that it looks ghetto - everyone freaks out! Black women should not be above criticism anywhere but especially not in the beauty community.

All of these things go back to what I was saying in my other comment about class and prole drift. The Glossier look is an upper middle class and up look that is trickling down into the MC, the baddie look is a prole look that has trickled up. 

Tagging /u/BellaScarletta and /u/littleknownfacts to hear their thoughts too!",3,FeminineNotFeminist
"Before I start I just want to let you know that you’re one of my favourite contributors to the sub! So please don’t take my comment as anything other than a desire for in depth conversation. Also /u/littleknownfacts I’d love to hear your thoughts on my comment too. I’ll start with the blog post first and then move on to your reddit post. 

A lot of the “baddie” makeup trends you listed are in fact feminine they are just about enhancing sex appeal. I wrote about this in my post Characteristics of Female Beauty (not currently on this sub b/c I have to redo the albums) but basically dark eye makeup + duskier skin + shaper bone structure + long lashes + heavy blush + plump lips = “I am sexually mature and currently ovulating and ready for an alpha to fuck me” hahaha. And men absolutely want to sleep with these women in the right contexts. Some of these techniques have a masculinizing effect because as women mature they do in fact look more masculine. But in order to look sexy you have to look mature (from a biological standpoint) so it’s just not accurate to say that the current trends are completely unfeminine. I do agree though that some women are unskilled and take it too far, or they don’t think about their own features and exaggerate their existing masculinized bone structure. Also there is a certain aggressiveness that can be felt coming from a lot of the women who use these techniques but I actually think that ties in to my next point. 

I don’t think the adoption of “baddie” makeup is an example of cultural appropriation but rather further evidence of prole drift.The looks that you complained about are not limited to one specific ethnicity. Poorer women of all backgrounds have worn things like that for a while - blacks, hispanics, italians, other white groups depending on the location. Their look heightens everythign sexual about women at once, this used to be considered vulgar now it is cool. It is now trickling upward as so many trends and practices have over the decades (and centuries really). There is an illusion that this is a race thing because the people going all out on this trend are mostly middle class and up white women. I actually want to write a whole post about prole drift in the beauty community because it really bothers me so I won’t say too much right now but hopefully you see what I’m driving at? 

To speak briefly on what you’re saying about cultural appropriation, I just completely disagree with the idea that makeup looks have to be restricted to certain groups. Each individual component was not invented by or perfected by the proles who popularized the “baddie” look. And there are plenty of white women who look objectively HOT wearing that makeup. Now I *personally* am not a fan but I don’t think the subject is as black and white as you’re making it. And I especially don’t think there is a moral issue with white women (or anyone) adopting this look.

Next I want to talk to you about Glossier and a cool idea that I read on a different sub. I don’t have the link but this person differentiated between three types of makeup looks. “No makeup makeup” as it is traditionally used refers to when your final result looks like you have as little makeup as possible, even though it took you several steps to get to this point. There is no restriction on the amount of products you can use to look like you’re not wearing much. In contrast, Glossier is all about looking great without makeup (through skincare) and then adding a few products to enhance your natural beauty. They believe that less is more. And then finally there are brands like Milk makeup where the goal is to look like you spent as little time on your makeup as possible, but it is different from Glossier in that you can use bright and unorthodox colours. It isn’t about natural beauty at all just looking effortless. I agree with these distinctions and I think it’s important to separate Glossier from “no makeup makeup” because the philosophies are very different. 

I’d also like to challenge the idea that both “no makeup makeup” and the Glossiser look are flattering to everyone. They are certainly not flattering for me! I have a different posts coming soon about that so I’ll keep this comment from going on forever haha

I’m almost done but I want to single out this phrase from your post on FNF “it isn't flattering unless you're ethnically diverse”. There is this awful idea ingrained in the West that white people don’t have an ethnicity or culture. Phrases like this really highlight how whites are lumped together and cast aside as if they are neutral and/or don’t count. There are white ethnicities just as there are black, latino, and asian ethnicities! And there is diversity both between the white ethnicities and within them! 

And finally, beauty standards are not about our personal preferences. They are external pressures and expectations that come both from biological instinct and the tastes of the men and women at any given time and location. Most people are incapable of determining what flatters them so I don’t think that encouraging women to solely use her own judgement is the right course of action.

Exactly so glad you get it! I feel like people should either save their money and buy the real thing or get something that suits their needs within their budget. Nearly every possible type of makeup product exists for under $40. I seriously don't understand how these knock offs are appealing - where is the pleasure coming from?

"I absolutely love department stores, niche online beauty shops, and Sephora. At all three you have a more personal experience and the settings are clean, organized, and visually appealing. I really like to take my time and look at packaging, read boxes, and browse without pressure. I do so much research online but nothing beats the in person experience. For example I spent tons of time reading up on this Caudalie moisturizer and I was so pumped to buy it. I went into Sephora and the container was so tiny! Not one photo or video made it look as small as it really was. 

For anyone who is into clean beauty, my go to online shops are: Integrity Botanicals, CAP Beauty, and The Detox Market. Pharmica also has a ton of stuff but their selection is more like the drugstore and midrange equivalent. Thankfully both Sephora and SpaceNK are expanding their clean beauty offerings!

"I've read so many discussions on the issue across reddit's beauty community and it's really disappointing to see women dismiss Kat Von D's point.

Not only do they diminish the hard work that went in to creating the original, they reinforce a sense of entitlement within the makeup community. If you can't afford a palette then you can't afford it! You are not owed a product just because you want it.

There is a huge difference between products that have similar color and formulas (the normal use of ""dupe"") and products that are created to look and feel exactly like a more expensive product. It is really gross (to me) that the latter happens. And yes I am 100% against knock off fashion as well. It is just so tacky to use a cheap imitation.

"My approaches to skincare and wardrobe organization have reversed! I used to like mixing and matching clothes and trying out different looks and styles on a whim. In contrast I wanted one set routine for my face that I adhered to strictly. Now I'm totally the opposite - I want a signature look, and I want to be able to pick and choose products based on how my skin feels that day. 

Personally I define ""signature look"" as a separate from the concept of a ""personal uniform"". Not everyone does this so I'll explain how I see it! To me, a personal uniform involves wearing roughly the same items every day. Your colors, items, silhouettes, etc will be almost identical daily. Tons of women prefer this because they don't have to think about what to wear - they know it'll be a white top and black pants, or a skirt suit, or whatever other combination they like sticking to. Personal uniforms seem very utilitarian and dependent on accessories to mix things up. 

On the other hand, ""signature looks"" are all about leaving a consistent impression (to me). I plan on staying within the boundaries of my style guide which means the same silhouette and color scheme always; but the individual outfits and combinations will change. It's one step more limiting than having a defined style, there will definitely be less room for experimentation. For example even if I come across a jumpsuit that I like and it checks all the boxes for my personal style, I wouldn't wear it because it doesn't match my signature look. I could look fabulous in it but attractiveness isn't the only factor here. I want people to have a specific image of me in their head even if I don't literally look like that all the time. 
 
When it comes to my skin, I think I've changed positions because I've solved most of my immediate problems. In a month I'll be able to just focus on maintaining great skin in the present and anti - aging. This means I can have more fun and flexibility since there won't be hard goals anymore.

>But this accessibility of androgyny/gender bent expression in a way makes this look book almost pedestrian and less high fashion.

Excellent point! I do believe this is the intention though - normalising non-heteronormativity. Even H&M has androgynous clothing, it isn’t elite in the slightest. But it does have some edge still due to how unnatural it is. The taboo aspect makes it feel cooler than it really is. 

>And while I love rocking an accentuated waist, red lipstick and done hair on most days, there's something about my blazer and brogues every now and then that, although a masculine style, somehow underscore how masculine I am not, making me feel all the more feminine.

I remember “borrowing from the boys” being a trend not too long ago and it was about this very idea. A woman wearing menswear/menswear inspired clothing in a way that heightened her femininity. I remember seeing some really cool photo shoots that played with this idea but you never got the vibe that they were promoting actual gender bending you know? That sort of exploration is something I can get behind (not personally but it certainly is visually interesting).

>Overall, I'm excited about it because it means options for everyone, and that makes me feel good about the world I get to live in….I think it's great, harmless, exciting for artists, and wonderful if it presents opportunity for practical innovation.

As a believer in free market capitalism I do support the right for everyone to purchase (and wear) what they please however these collections aren’t just about clothes. They are one more component of the larger agenda to blur gender lines, destroy the nuclear family, and many more things that spell disaster for the West. /u/PhantomDream09 made a post today that touches on some of these ideas. I also speak about this more in other parts of this comment section.

>If anything, that title makes it easier for people on either side to decide if it was worth their time.

Agreed! I said this in a different comment but my issue with the title is how it falls in line with the general celebration of degeneracy that is common today. Art used to be praised for its beauty, goodness, technical skill, perspective, and all the other intangibles that make something legitimate. For many today the most important standard is how “evil” it is. So it’s not just about morality in my case but the overall change in standards for judging art (above a certain class level). 

So glad you joined in the conversation!

"Pretty sure you didn’t read my stickied comment which explained why I posted the article and the focus of the conversation (as well as discussion questions). I’m also willing to bet that you didn’t look at any other comments prior to posting because there are discussions about the larger implications of runway collections. The blog post I shared used hyperbolic language to emphasize how terrible it is that *so many* designers are rejecting the concept of masculinity itself. Your literal interpretation of the post and hyperfocus on the one designer mentioned is causing you to dismiss a really serious issue. /u/PhantomDream09 submitted a very informative post earlier today that goes into more detail about the cultural impact of seemingly trivial things. 

I’m not convinced that you’re seeing the bigger picture if you’re dismissing these collections as “just art” and the viewers as pretenders. Many designers and thought leaders have explicitly stated their vision of turning gender on its head. This isn’t just an attempt to be different or make headlines. I go into this more in all of my other comments so do take a look.

"I am in LOVE with this!! So glad that you’ve collected a lot of examples that show the way that media can influence society on every level. I agree with you that many don’t seem to see how everything is connected; what is fashionable today is not an accident! Let me answer your qs and then after you respond I’ll share more thoughts (so that this comment isn’t too long).

* Obviously I’m not a fan of the androgyny aspect of the collection but I dislike it from a non ideological standpoint as well. I’ve never been a fan of normcore or minimalism so the clothes do nothing for me. I think the models are both attractive and I can see that they were trying to seem cool, effortless, modern, tough, etc. but the clothes just seem like something LMCs would wear in the 90s.

* This one is tough because there are so many to choose from! Something I wasn’t old enough for but I’m sure many people here remember: women getting their hair styled like Rachel on Friends. When I was in high school (500) Days of Summer came out - love this film - and everyone wanted to be a manic pixie dream girl who listened to The Smiths haha Sex And The City is one show that has had an enormous impact on women in terms of fashion, dating, friendships, and self esteem. Makeup looks from runway shows always trickle down into the mainstream beauty community. Bold brows, intense highlighter, pale nude lips, etc all were buzzed about after shows and in magazines before I saw them in real life or even on youtube.

* Yes I am very concerned about the war on gender. Not for myself or anyone in my immediate sphere, but I worry about Western civilisation as a whole. We have been in decline for so long and blurring gender lines will only further set us back. I completely agree with your points about how bad  many are at dating today. How are nuclear families going to form if people are too socially awkward or non conforming to actually have a proper date? I don’t believe that women will be satisfied with androgynous or feminized men, regardless of what feminists claim. What incentive would the men who can resist the media programming have to commit to women when his options are whores, sjws, fatties, and the mentally ill? 

* Celebrities might have money and influence but I don’t think most have the cultural capital to justify them attending exclusive events centered around politics or the economy. Their opinions aren’t newsworthy (with a few exceptions) and any statements that they make should be covered by specific media outlets like E!, ESPN, tabloids, lifestyle magazines and websites, etc. not actual broadcast news networks or respected papers. I think bringing in politics into awards ceremonies is a bad idea but I’ve never watched any so maybe everyone else enjoyed it? I just feel like anyone who isn’t inherently cool and interesting should shut up but the mediocre and lame seem to be really desperate for fame.

I've been using this for two weeks and I'd give it a solid B. I totally broke my usual rule and bought this without any research. I just spoke to a very nice saleslady at Sephora and tried on a bunch of different moisturizers on my hand (yes I read the claims on the box but normally I'm super thorough before purchasing skincare). I went in looking to buy something from Caudalie but I didn't realise how tiny those products are! 

The actual feel of the Sheer Transformation Moisturizer is amazing. It is very light and soft and it definitely softens the skin as it claims. I haven't added any additional scar removing products and my scars continue to fade - I do alot already though so I can't say for sure if this is effective at evening out the skintone. It hasn't broken me out and it wears well underneath makeup. That being said I find that it isn't enough on its own. I layer a pump of this [Damascus Rose Antioxidant Facial Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Badger-Balm-Damascus-Antioxidant-Certified/dp/B0063NKM6K/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488509074&sr=8-1&keywords=badger%2Brose%2Bface%2Boil&th=1) and my skin feels perfect after that. I'm sure Sheer Transformation would be fine alone for women with oily skin. 

Product #2 I love!

They aren't feminine they are *feminized*. Certain elements are more feminine than masculine e.g. a closer fitting pant vs a straight cut or even slightly loose. ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
"Different subcultures will have different norms and I don't think we can apply mainstream standards to those subcultures in the exact same way - even though they may still come into play. The first example I'll use is your rockstar question. Within the niche of whatever genre the man is part of it may be perfectly normal if not required for him to wear nail polish. If these men are wearing nail polish as an aesthetic choice seperate from gender then we have to take that into account. I'm not familiar with the reasoning behind why certain performers wear nail polish and I'm on the phone so I can't look it up easily while typing this response. If the hypothetical rockstar is presenting exactly like all other men then within that subculture he isn't androgynous (assuming of course that they aren't trying to be androgynous). However women outside of the subculture are probably attracted due to other aspects of his appearance, status, and talent. 

Another example: black men wearing cornrows is accepted within that culture whereas in the mainstream US culture men wearing braids is gay. It isn't androgynous at all for black men to have their hair braided. So many decisions related to presentation  have different significance in different groups within the US. 

That being said someone could certainly be objectively androgynous or feminized regardless of their intentions or subculture. They'd have to pass a certain point on the spectrum of gender presentation via the combination of clothing, hairstyle, accessories, etc. I'm imagining that the standard here would be based on biology. 

This is just my personal opinion and I hope it makes sense I'm off to bed now!

"I definitely agree with you that this post didn’t have enough context for those unfamiliar with the subject. It’s totally solipsistic on my part to have not considered this - I read the post and liked with it because I saw how his argument fit in with my observations. Anyone who doesn’t read magazines or keep up with the fashion world in general can’t be expected to have the same response. I really appreciate your thorough responses, and the fact that you point out the areas you know less about. Conversations like this are part of what make reddit great :) 

To clarify, yes I mean the realm of fashion. There is definitely a lot to criticize about the modern fashion industry so it’s not something I’m holding against him! I found his comments pretty funny so I do think our interpretations are the result of differing degrees of familiarity with that world. Since this post was a critique of something very specific I don’t think that it’s necessary for the author to show the other side or mention the positive things about runway shows or magazines. It would only detract from the main point. Imagine if someone on RPW ranted against a post about how modern “career women” weren’t “wife material”; if their comment said that the post was bad because it didn’t talk about all of the positive traits that career women have that allow them to succeed in the office, that wouldn’t be a good argument. 

I didn’t get an SJW vibe from his comment about emaciated models but I can see how you did. SJWs don’t hate the emaciated models because of the gender bending though, I’m not sure if they can even perceive that this is occurring. Any argument I’ve seen has come from a pro fat/ “real woman” stance that argues models are too thin because of the patriarchal standards for female perfection (or something like that). I can definitely imagine TERFs criticizing the gender bending/catering to gay men aspect though.

>That said, if the author is talking about ‘high fashion’ and Vogue no longer fits into that category, why is it being quoted?

US Vogue is regarded as elite by the middle class, some new money, and celebrity wannabes. It is totally coasting on the brand image and it still has a ton of influence due to its longstanding position in the industry. The magazine is a reliable method of seeing what the mainstream attitudes are even if it is not as cool as it once was. As an analogy - CNN is totally coasting on its reputation as an unbiased, popular news source. In reality it is pure propaganda and its numbers are dwindling. Nevertheless looking at what CNN is reporting and the opinions of its viewers can often be a legitimate way of gauging the pulse of the population on certain subjects.

From what I can tell everyone else liked the show as well, [here is a review on WWD](http://wwd.com/runway/mens-fall-collections-2017/new-york/palomo-spain/review/) - very positive. You can also see more pictures from the show. I think the clothing itself is pretty interesting but I hate that it’s for men and the intent behind it all is disgusting so I can’t see it as anything other than terrible. 

>When you bring in the lens of “does this normalize and damage what it means to be masculine and feminine in our culture, will this translate into even more radical trends for young boys?” Then the conversation changes completely for me.

Yes I posted a comment immediately after submitting the article that gave discussion questions but I don’t think that anyone actually read that prior to commenting themselves. That was the conversation that I wanted to have, next time I’ll do a self post to further shape the conversation and avoid confusion.

>I don’t follow fashion, I don’t read fashion blogs, magazines, or watch runway shows - I’m entirely ‘blind’ to how the fashion elite drive culture.

I also expected that women who responded would in fact be familiar with all of these things. Perhaps we can have more conversations as a community on this topic, it would be useful for future discussions on culture if everyone is on the same page. 

>I don’t think people should allow media or entertainment to warp, twist, push, pressure, or influence them beyond the morals, values, and interest they personally define for themselves.

While I agree that people should be strong enough so that their values aren’t warped, twisted, pushed, or pressured, I think that the best TV shows, films, songs, and art in general will have an influence on your worldview. We can’t experience everything ourselves so the media is often a source of information about the world and about humanity. The key is exposing yourself to the right things, and critical thinking (in my opinion).

>I agree that it’s a far more interesting discussion (and a worthwhile one) to talk about the overall agenda to confuse/erase/invert gender roles, presentation etc. 

Me too! I’ll probably start another thread in a week or two unless this one picks up with more discussion on this subject specifically. 

>I do enjoy the speech by Streep in The Devil Wears Prada and I absolutely see her point - I know I’m the clueless Andy for the most part 

LOL <3

>I also think it would have helped the author to point to multiple examples other than the fashion show. 

I saw the article as one piece of a larger conversation, using one specific moment as a jumping off point. I agree that it would have been more accessible if more examples were used. I still feel like conversation is possible without in depth knowledge of high fashion. You yourself said that you get the Meryl Streep speech in The Devil Wears Prada. That’s basically all you need to know to answer my discussion qs - which I will now sticky for the benefit of future post readers.

This comment is so long already and I didn’t even get to talk about the meat of the discussion. You already know how I feel about the subject though and I’m glad to see more of your perspective!
",1,FeminineNotFeminist
"Thanks for such an in depth response!

I don’t think that an understanding of the world of high fashion is necessary for this comment section because I am interested in discussing the larger impact of runway trends, not the runway shows themselves. As I said in another comment I disagree with the author’s negative opinion of high fashion but agree with the main argument of the post. I think that outright disliking that realm - or any broad category - is totally fine, everyone can have their own interests. His perspective as an outsider allows him to make points from a different angle. I appreciated the critical tone of the post and enjoyed the hyperbolic statements that the author made, it was entertaining while still emphasizing his points. I didn’t take things as literally or seriously as you did, some of your takeaways from the post were entirely different than mine. 

For example the statement about modern art being transgressive and for lunatics. This was definitely a joke designed to make a bigger point. That being said, in many circles modern art absolutely is about being transgressive. The definition that you copied is one that many who create and enjoy modern art would agree with. I didn’t take the statement to mean that every single designer was a lunatic trying to be the most transgressive. 

I’m also not sure why you thought he was saying that Vogue was the origin or sole publisher of skinny models. Again I found his description quite funny! There are skinny models (the result of designers and photographers selecting for androgyny and women who look like teenage boys) and there is celebrity gossip. Both of these things can be criticized, it doesn’t matter if it is the norm. 

Also I wouldn’t compare modern Vogue to how it was in the past at all. The magazine has declined so much over the years and so many people who are into fashion have given up because it has basically turned into People magazine. The Kardashians have been on its cover. They are the exact opposite of high fashion. If you look at fashion forums or blogs of women who are really into fashion US Vogue isn’t held in high regard like it used to be. It’s basically a cargo cult. I just feel like you read a lot into his statement that wasn’t there and argued something that he wasn’t even talking about. 

If you read Vogue (or Harper’s Bazzar, Porter, or any magazine that covers high fashion) you’d see photoshoots and articles that encourage women to embrace androgyny and masculine presentation. This is considered cutting edge but it is presented as more than being “in” it is about rejecting heteronormativity. The relationship between runway shows, the media, and everyday people is definitely something that I wanted to discuss with this sub. The article was just a clear example that shows one aspect of the issue. 

Yes the reviews in the magazines are not 100% literal but the point remains that they *are* promoting feminized men, not just as a fashion statement. And the way that they choose to discuss these shows is by using language that highlights the degeneracy. There is a strong relationship between the left and the celebration of ugliness, chaos, and death. 

I said this to another commenter but the point about changes in men’s fashion throughout time isn’t equivalent to what is happening here. What we are seeing on the runway is a reflection of the changing definition of what it is to be a man at all. The fact that “technically” X group wore Y item that is stereotypically feminine today is really just a distraction. A man who wears a kilt due to Scottish heritage is not challenging gender roles because in that culture *men wear kilts*. In mainstream US culture, it is *abnormal* for men to wear clothing with feminine characteristics. The designers and stores who carry new clothing are not just trying to be different or bold, they are intentionally trying to change the way that men and women define themselves. This isn’t a conspiracy it is stated boldly in magazines and online if you read about the inspirations behind various collections. 

>Furthermore, if anyone looks to movies, fashion, or music as moral guides....I think that's the bigger indication of lunacy.

I completely disagree with this. Not only do the majority of people take their cues from the media, it is understandable because a) it is human nature to both look for authorities and follow the herd and b) the lack of religion creates a need in a lot of people’s lives for a new standard. It may seem ridiculous but many people form opinions about the world by looking at what others say and then cobbling together what makes the most sense to them.

"I get what you were saying about men's fashion in the past and it lines up with my point about how some designers today have completely different intentions. It's not just about being different or new for them. 

You keep going to extremes with your examples but the effects of these designs are subtle and widespread. Even men who don't actively follow fashion are still going to be impacted by the overall changes. For example slim fitting tops, pants, and even suits are increasingly considered more fashionable than the more standard cuts.  [Here is an easy example that shows the differences that I'm talking about.](http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0073/8132/files/Slim_Standard_and_Loose_Fit_Suit_or_Shirt.jpg?1236) Another example is skinny jeans, a look that has been trendy for men for a while now. [Here](https://www.thetrendspotter.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Wear-Men%E2%80%99s-Skinny-Jeans-3.jpg) and [here](https://www.thetrendspotter.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-to-Wear-Men%E2%80%99s-Skinny-Jeans-2.jpg) are examples of men wearing them in a variety of styles, showing that the look isn't confined to one group. If you look at the media aimed at men - magazines or even the male fashion advice sub, you'll see similarly feminized looks. Not saying every look will be feminine, just that the idea is present in nearly every level of fashion today. 

The people who decide on the designs to make and/or sell at their store are influenced by trends and make choices based on what is currently popular. In many stores this means that more androgynous or feminized clothing will be on display because that is what is ""in"". It will not be marketed to straight men as a super rebellious or gay way to dress. So while the number of people intentionally subverting gender roles through their clothing choices is low, overall we see men dressing differently due to the larger shifts in the way people think about masculinity and femininity. This doesn't have to be a conscious decision on the man's part, but it is a conscious decision on the part of the designer and the fashion buyer.

"I don't think that individual designers are masterminds behind any of the cultural decay we're seeing but they certainly are assisting in that decline by pushing their own messages through their work. The concepts of androgyny and rejecting heteronormativity aren't exclusively being promoted to people under 20 or those who are SJWs or ""edgy"". These ideas can be found in magazines aimed at adults such as Vogue, Harper's Bazzar, and Porter. There is a difference between people who naturally aren't as masculine/feminine as the average man/woman and the promotion of intentionally rejecting the concept of gender via fashion. Maybe you haven't seen it but the sheer excitement that many adults in the fashion industry have towards the idea of tearing down the traditional understanding of masculinity and femininity is concerning. ",1,FeminineNotFeminist
"The issue is that high fashion affects ready to wear collections, magazines, tv shows, the choices of celebrities, and ultimately the everyday person. Runway shows don't exist in a vacuum. Many actively turn to these looks in order to determine their own personal style and those who don't will still be impacted by the overall changes in the mainstream. High fashion is art yes but it also is a reflection of the times and a source of cultural change.

What the article is arguing is more than just men's fashion changing over time. Sure in the past men wore tights and heels but there was a very clear understanding that men and women were different. Men weren't wearing ""feminine"" clothing in an attempt to challenge heteronormativity. The designers of the time were not attempting to be as depraved as possible nor was being ""evil"" considered a badge of honor. 

So many men today are embracing the trends of androgyny or outright femininity. No it isn't as extreme as the outfits in runway shows but that isn't the best metric to assess how well any designer's ideas have permeated into mainstream pop culture. Additionally these shows shape the tastes of the women consuming these images. It will be interesting to see how the concept of the ideal man changes as androgyny and gender flipping continue to gain popularity.

"I actually find all three of those looks interesting and appealing, but I understand why someone who isn't familiar with the realm would be confused. As I said in my other comment I wanted to have a discussion about the cultural implications of the latest trends.

Additionally there is a difference in the way the designer's vision is discussed and promoted to mainstream audiences. I for one am not a fan of the race to the most depraved and subversive. Hailing a show for being ""evil"" just doesn't sit right with me. I'm all for questioning the status quo and presenting something novel as art, but there is clearly an agenda that extends beyond mere expression.

"Now I actually enjoy high fashion so I don't share the same negative attitude towards the entire field like the author, but I agree with the overall issue presented in the post. Obviously if you aren't religious ignore the religious paragraph at the end. The point remains that those who are in charge of shaping the tastes of the country are pushing androgyny and the inversion of gender roles. Even if the runway versions of the looks are more extreme, the concepts trickle down into ready to wear lines and influence magazines, tv shows, and celebrity choices. All of this influences the everyday person. 

Of course not every man will start dressing in this manner, there are plenty of subgroups that are insulated from the feminization of male fashion. I'd love for us to discuss these trends as well as the effect it has on women's fashion. 

* Have you all noticed the push for women to be more androgynous and/or dress in menswear? 

* What do you think about runway shows where men wear traditionally female articles of clothing? 

* Are you comfortable with titles such as “Palomo Spain: “The Most Amazing, Beautiful, Decadent, Evil Thing’ at the New York Men’s Shows“. ? 

Let's talk about anything else that comes to mind :) ",1,FeminineNotFeminist
What a well written and informative comment! I agree with all of your points especially the distinction between learning about a culture through the lens of that cultures values and perspective vs glorifying and normalizing their beliefs and practices.,2,The_Donald
"People don't just use one singular source when discussing the wage gap - on either side of the debate. I have seen several blog posts and articles that reference statistics gathered both from hard data and self reported surveys and polls. Additionally when women discuss the subject using their own personal experiences and observations, the risk of overestimation of hours worked comes into play. The concept of the gender pay gap isn't as narrow as you seem to believe. Real life conversations that happen surrounding the subject aren't limited to one report or type of study.

"I want sweater #2 so badly where did you get yours?! The color doesn't look right in the photo but that may be lighting or the lack of makeup, not sure. I definitely prefer it to sweater #1, although I feel like different pants would work better. The lighter wash and whiskering of the jeans draw the eye to the place where the shirt ends which creates the illusion of the top being slightly too short. Or maybe it's just me! I know I prefer the darkest, most even, wash ever for jeans so I'm probably just biased haha :)  ",5,FeminineNotFeminist
"I don't think you understand the point that she was making. Overestimating is not the same as lying. It involves miscalculating how long something took you to complete. It is a mistake, not intentional fraud. 

If you ask someone how long it took for them to create a report, if they didn't keep a precise log they have to rely on their memory. When they think back on the process they may remember the pressure and stress that they felt and the research they did, and they may recall sitting at their desk for a considerable amount of time. Taking all of this into account, as well as possibly the length of time of previous projects, they may say it took 6 hours. Well it may have actually only taken 4. Or perhaps they did spend 6 hours working on it but they were multitasking both with other projects and personal tasks/conversations. 

If women respond to a survey asking how long they work each day, it isn't implausible that some women would over estimate their hours. ",6,FeminineNotFeminist
"I agree that everything you listed contributes to the ""wage gap"" and want to note that most people who disagree with the concept of the wage gap are disagreeing with the idea that men are intentionally paying women less to keep them down and paying other men more because of the patriarchy. Feminists use the term to describe the same scenario, and if they do mention things such as a woman's inability to negotiate her salary, it is still used as evidence of the evil patriarchy and other feminist talking points. 

Many of the factors that contribute to a difference between male and female salaries are due to the choices of individual women. Whether it is their choice of job, their decision to have children, their choice to accept the first deal offered instead of negotiating, etc. The issue isn't that there is a gap, the gap is indicative of how incompatible most women are with the male workforce. Feminists don't seem to be able to accept responsibility for their position and constantly blame others and outside forces. 

In my opinion private employers should be able to make their own decisions when it comes to hiring, firing, and paying employees. So if there are male bosses who actively choose to pay their female employees less (or more) it doesn't bother me. When it comes to government institutions it makes sense to have regulations in place however we will still see a difference in the average male and female salary due to all of the factors we've been talking about. 

I just can't get up in arms like some people can when discussing the subject.",2,FeminineNotFeminist
"Managers and executives run businesses with the goal of making money. The reality is that women who are pregnant, have children, or are soon to be pregnant cost the company money. Maternity leave, reduced hours in office, emergencies with their kids, etc cannot be ignored. Why would the person in charge of promotions choose the woman who is about to leave for months, or constantly puts other things above her job, or worse struggles to manage the work/life balance appropriately? If there is a man who shows up every single day, doesn't leave or bring his kids in, won't need extended months off of work, doesn't feel the same sense of stress or even depression about being away from his family - isn't he the better choice. Many women **choose** to have fewer hours and arrange their schedules so that they can spend less time at work and more time with their families. This is fine, but its not economical to hire and promote people who aren't as committed to the job. This doesn't mean that *all* women do this, but any prudent exec will be aware of the statistics and probabilities. 

You have a lot of other ridiculous points in your comment but I'm not going to get into them because this is not a debate sub - our rules can be found on the sidebar and on our wiki. We are an anti feminist space and don't want to waste time defending basic concepts especially when they aren't related to the post in question.

"Nice find! I really like his point at the end about the potential future without chemistry between men and women if things continue as they are (or get worse). 

I definitely think that a lot of people conflate femininity with a specific type of personality when there are a variety of ways that true femininity can be expressed. I've seen the concept of ""yin"" and ""yang"" being used to describe women's personalities and features to differentiate between masculine and feminine. In fact I'll be writing about two of these systems in the near future for FNF.

There are plenty of female traits that are more ""yang"", not masculine in the slightest. For example imagine the archetypes of a ""femme fatale"" or a warm but strict older black mom. Both of these women have a feminine energy, it is just different than the ""introverted, quiet, giggly, loves bunnies, doesn't drink, or curse"" stereotype. 

My hope is that we can avoid an overly narrow description of femininity within this community, so that all members can celebrate what makes them awesome women!",5,FeminineNotFeminist

"It actually seems like they are mostly targeting ""open minded"" women who also believe that men should wear makeup. These women want to align themselves with a brand that is progressive and edgy, two things that don't usually come to mind when you think ""Covergirl"".

I think black eyeliner is different than concealer because defining the lashline makes you look more feminine whereas concealing a blemish just makes you look normal. Plenty of women would be uncomfortable knowing that a man wears eyeliner (I know I would!) whereas they'd be sympathetic to a man concealing a blemish. ,2,FeminineNotFeminist
"Love all of your points! What was really annoying this rewatch was the amount of times Andy said that she ""didn't have a choice"". She totally acted like a victim without agency. The part where she misses her boyfriend's bday stands out to me as an area where she messed up but not in the way the movie portrayed it. I feel like it wouldn't have been hard for her to communicate clearly about why she wouldn't be there, and send a text or two during the party. What we saw was her promising to be there and then silence for hours and then showing up to apologise. If she stopped giving people false expectations they wouldn't have been as disappointed.",2,FeminineNotFeminist

">I would have to say being delicate, which to me entails grace, speaking lightly, being gentle.

While this is definitely one example of inner beauty I feel like a lot of people act like it's the only way to be feminine when that isn't the case. You can have a vibrant or bold personality without being ugly on the inside, or masculinised. Do all women master this? Of course not haha you're right that many women are cringey, but I don't think that being delicate and gentle is the path to inner beauty for all women. 

>I definitely think we're TOLD to value our inner beauty, but I don't think it means the same thing to many non-RPW. Today's inner beauty seems more ""you go gurrrl"" and ""you be you"", instead of actually taking the time to evaluate whether you even have good qualities to offer anyone.

Agreed! This selfish mentality is definitely not part of inner beauty. Generosity, compassion, support, etc. are all some good traits to have instead don't you think?",2,FeminineNotFeminist
"I believe ""inner beauty"" is a distinct characteristic that measures a different set of traits than ""value"". At the most basic level, ""beauty"" is a quality dependent on the person/object in question having a combination of attributes that pleases the observer. If you look at this definition alone it seems interchangeable with “value” but both words mean so much more than this definition. 

Throughout Western history we have mostly agreed (whether formally or instinctively) that the truly beautiful meets these two requirements: 

* The object in question must excel at being that object. When judging anything we compare it to all other things in that category, as well as the platonic conception of that thing. Often the most important factors for judgement are the traits that define and separate the thing from all other objects. A beautiful painting isn’t beautiful because of the wooden frame used to make the canvas, and it wouldn’t be a “beautiful painting” if it was actually a photograph. It also could not be beautiful if it was a failed attempt at a painting, or if it violated every single principle of art and visual theory. 

* The object in question must be exceptional. It must stand out from objects just like it and have an impact on the observer. It must be deeply satisfying in a way that is nearly indescribable. 
Both of these qualities are easily seen when considering physical beauty but that doesn’t mean that the term is limited to assessing the aesthetic. I believe that the most important element when determining beauty is the impact on the observer. An item can check all the boxes and excel without being beautiful. 

Humans have multiple dimensions to our being - we are more than our appearance and therefore there is more that can be assessed. We have many intangible aspects that combine to create impressions and leave impacts. Additionally there are standards both for humanity as a whole and for our gender that we can either meet or fall short of. We are capable of excelling as humans (and by this I mean eudaimonia) and we are capable of having a pleasing, deeply satisfying impact on others. 

Is “inner beauty” the exact same as “beauty”? Of course not, that is why there is a modifier in front of “beauty”. It further defines what is being discussed - mostly the personality and demeanor of another person. When women discuss “inner beauty” they list traits that are examples of excelling at the uniquely feminine e.g. grace. This ties into another thing I want to talk about later - women using the term “feminine” as a synonym for “good”. There is a subconscious understanding that being a good woman = being good at being a woman. Both inside and out. 

But onto “value”! While “beauty” refers to the state of the object itself and the emotional impact it has on the observer, “value” is a measurement of worth. This could be intrinsic or it could be something exchanged/used for other benefits. I believe that beauty can give value to something, but something can have value without beauty. And people can have value without inner or outer beauty - just a different type of value than those with both. To connect with your comment, my idea explains why attractive people have access to more opportunities as you noted in your comment. They exchange their appearance for benefits. There is value in their beauty - two separate concepts being used together to advance that person. 

Tying this into “inner beauty” the issue arises when people act like the value given by inner beauty outweighs the value that outer beauty gives, to the point where they disregard outer beauty entirely. And then there are those that see that outer beauty is easily used to obtain benefits, so they discount the importance of inner beauty! To be fair to feminists, the idea of traditional female inner beauty is completely at odds with their standards and goals so of course they would reject them. And so the only avenue many of them have for value within the female sphere is through their looks. Their pursuit of signifiers or male value only makes matters worse but that’s a conversation for another day too! 

So I agree with a lot of what you’re saying just from a different angle.

"This is phenomenal and so true! My mother has an hourglass figure and I spent soo much time with her when she was getting things tailored haha it really makes all the difference in how things look. Love the point you made about how people won't ask you about the size you're wearing. A semi related tip for anyone who has mental hangups about their size/number: when you try things on be sure to get a few different sizes of the same garment. Try on the largest size first and work your way down. This way you avoid the embarrassing feeling of having to go up a size (if this is something that embarrasses you).

"Your no makeup look is great! How many products are you wearing? If you're wearing any sort of base it is undetectable which is awesome. 

CC I can think of - eyebrows may be a bit to sharp/defined and also you could use a bit more concealer under the eyes. Not sure if there is actually anything wrong with your eyebrows or if they just stand out more due to how subtle the rest of your makeup is. It just feels a bit unbalanced in the bottom two pics but not in a way that anyone on a day to day basis would notice. 

For under eyes, do you color correct at all? Or something to depuff? I just watched Briana Stanko's latest favorites video and she sets her under eyes with an Hourglass ALP - maybe you could do the same/equivalent? ",2,FeminineNotFeminist
There really is a hole in the market for a makeup company that is 100% for men to cover their imperfections.

There are all sorts of lip balms, skincare products, non basic hair care products, etc aimed at men.

"Ooh love this! I actually came up with phrases and ideas when I was making my personal style guide for the new style that I am transitioning into so I'll explain that in detail in case it helps others with the process. 

At first my style was called ""Understated Bombshell"" (a name I made up) but then I went down the rabbit hole that is the Kibbe System (will write about this later) and I loved the term Theatrical Romantic, which is my type and I resonate with it 100%. He describes TR as ""Femme Fatale Chic"" which is very close to my UB description: Romantic, Alluring, and Timeless. So I started with both ideas and built on them to flesh out what I want to look like. 

""Femme""/romantic to me meant feminine delicacy. I wanted that aspect of my appearance to be charming, enchanting, flirty, light. I like how Kibber describes ""Fatale""/Alluring as an ""arresting magnetism"". I definitely want to be sensual and stunning. It's why I chose the term ""bombshell"" initially! Finally Chic/Timeless is all about looking elevated but since I enjoy the aesthetics of multiple time periods the phrase I came up with is ""anachronistic elegance"". 

So those are all the words that I use! I will note that the words you use to define your style definitely affect your mindset towards your look. ""Understated Bombshell"" fits but the connotation is that I'm reigning in the Bombshell a bit, where as Theatrical Romantic captures the dynamic and vibrant aspect of my look. I feel more confident wearing things I would have considered bolder in the past. Something to consider!

"Agreed!! I wrote about it a bit in my comment, would love to hear your thoughts! Have you seen The September Issue?",2,FeminineNotFeminist
"So I actually completely disagree with Andy's ""growth"" at the end and the way her friends treated her. 

Now some of her growth was legitimate and necessary. Andy intentionally accepted for a demanding job and this job was even more demanding because of how little she knew about the world she was entering. She made it harder for herself from the beginning by resisting everything and being condescending. When she got rid of her ego, put effort into her appearance, and actually had a handle on everything she was great! Her external makeover matched the internal makeover that was happening at the same time. Loved this transition and seeing a peek into the magazine world throughout the film. I highly recommend The September Issue for anyone who wants more! Not only is it real life, it's about Vogue - the inspiration for The Devil Wears Prada.

Okay so the parts I didn't agree with:


Her friends were totally selfish and not understanding of the pressures of her new job. They expected her to have the same amount of free time, energy, enthusiasm, etc and get mad at her for actually being productive. None of them have the sort of position that Andy did so it's not like everyone was busy but all of them managed except for her. It's understandable that they'd be a bit let down when she couldn't make things but they literally never seemed to accept that she had a new, demanding job, where she thrived. Her boyfriend's issues are more legitimate and I think their relationship struggling is very realistic - it's hard to be a career woman and good SO. 

At the end of the film Andy is horrified by the (awesome) maneuvering that Miranda did to maintain her position. She realizes how fake and cruel things are and decides she doesn't want a part in that world. I get that it's a film and all but she wants to be a journalist. That *whole* field is nothing but alliances, lies, secret deals, heavy information dropped on you without warning, selfish people climbing their way to the top, people who do whatever it takes to stay in power, etc. It's just as fake and shallow if not more in some instances! And of course the fashion industry isn't 100% fake or about gambits, but the idea that she was now going to be ""real"" and stress free any new job is just funny when you think about it. Business is business and if she can't handle people looking out for their best interest and bottom line she should stay at home. Which I would totally have approved of as an alternate ending LOL

"Love this! 

I completely agree that the way that our country dresses is a reflection of our morale, values, culture, etc. While the author brings up a good point about seeming like we've given up, I also think that the way people dress is a result of coasting. Both point to laziness but from different sources. 

America has been #1 for so long that many here take it for granted. This leads to people shrugging off all sorts of standards; effort doesn't seem as necessary since we've already ""won"". Obviously most people aren't consciously, literally, thinking about it in this way but I believe that this idea subtly influences a lot of people. We have prosperity (in comparison to other countries) so there isn't as much pressure from the environment, which will shape the way society organizes itself including our dress codes.

"Agreed these levels really help with discussion. Let me quote myself from a different comment:

>Levels of refinement is different than a dress code because it looks at each individual piece and not the full look. For example a ""business casual top"" could be Level 1 or Level 2; the same could be said for a ""dressy casual"" and ""smart casual"" top. This is because most tops in those categories are either dressed up or down via accessories and the other items worn. Saying a level 2 top is more specific because it talks about the top itself and doesn't rely on the other clothing in its definition.

I hope we can use these terms across the sub!",2,FeminineNotFeminist

Awesome! I love mixing 1/2 for everyday - you feel pretty and put together without being dramatically overdressed or inconvenienced. ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
"Thank you for including photos it will make it easier to discuss the topic! I think the general nature of the categories is important because it allows you to make faster decisions when you're getting dressed or shopping. It also make it a bit easier to analyze exactly why an outfit does or doesn't work (for the layperson). 

Levels of refinement is different than a dress code because it looks at each individual piece and not the full look. For example a ""business casual top"" could be Level 1 or Level 2; the same could be said for a ""dressy casual"" and ""smart casual"" top. This is because most tops in those categories are either dressed up or down via accessories and the other items worn. Saying a level 2 top is more specific because it talks about the top itself and doesn't rely on the other clothing in its definition.

The pearls that you gave a picture of would be Level 2, so it fits with the idea that 2/3 and 1/2 works. The leather makes it more casual, taking it out of the Level 1 group. It's not just about the pearls it's about the entire piece - shape, length, materials, etc. 

Trends that are about juxtaposition only underscore the rule because the point of the trend is going against the grain and matching up things that *aren't supposed to go together*. If there was no underlying principle about what types of clothes matched best, then these trends wouldn't be seen as daring or different. Also most people don't like the trends that you listed specifically because it looks ridiculous on most people in everyday situations. And it looks ridiculous because 1/3 pairings are just extremely hard to pull off - and why would most women want to? 

As someone who's style has been a mix of southern and northern prep for most of my life (with 90% of my friends dressing the same) I can absolutely say that mixing levels 1 and 3 weren't a thing on an everyday basis. The first photo looks like 2/3 to me - just because something is pearl doesn't mean it is Level 1. It's also not a fashionable look, just a trendy one. 

The second photo looks like a mix of 2 and 3 as well but we'd have to know what the clothes are made of to be sure. There is a relaxed fit of the blazer, which is rolled up at the sleeves - possibly indicating that the materials and cut are level 2. She also could have sized up in a regular blazer to get the effect, but that choice still makes it less formal than if she brought a properly fitted standard blazer. The pants are level 3 and we'd have to feel the shirt to know if it is level 2 or 3. Shoes and bags are also 2. Scarf could be 2 or 1. I wonder if having all 2/1 on top and 2/3 on bottom makes it possible to mix all three and look cohesive? 

Often trends are about breaking the established rules and this post is about an established rule that doesn't often get articulated as clearly. Even within these trends there are rules, for example in the casual southern prep image that you linked - there are certain types of tops, leggings, socks, and boots that get worn. You can't just throw together anything that vaguely resembles the outfit and have the same effect. There is a similar principle of balance necessary to make sure you look cohesive and not sloppy. The material, cut, fit, length, color, etc are all part of that and even though the items are casual, they are still far more refined than what one would wear working out. To someone who doesn't dress like this it may just seem like ""leggings"" but I believe that the elevation of those casual pieces allows you to wear level 2 things and look like you are more refined than you actually are in the moment.

"I love this concept and have applied it successfully to my own wardrobe. The clothing shown in the article is very dated, who knew what was in style 5 years ago would look so jarring so quickly?! Just move past it lol :)

Personally I dress in a mix of Levels 1 and 2 and feel so weird if I am head to toe in Level 3 clothing. ""Casual"" for me is wearing all Level 2 items and then if I need to be more formal, it's all Level 1. From what I can tell, the women on reddit (e.g. on femalefashionadvice) mostly wear Level 2 and Level 3 clothes.

"I think there is a lot that separates “storytelling” from other concepts such as “leaving an impression”, “signaling”, “creating a mood”, and “infusing with meaning”.  The first that comes to mind is the desired result. Those four are all about obtaining a specific perception from the observer when it comes to you/your product. For example a woman who carries a Bottega Veneta handbag may be signaling her socioeconomic class and also she may desire for others to view her as sophisticated and tasteful (impression). This is totally me thinking out loud but I would define “mood” as the feeling that you get as a result of the combined elements in a given product/thing, whereas “impression” is the feeling you have *about* the product/thing due to that combination of elements. And then “signals” are often the individual elements themselves. Finally “meaning” is found in the interpretation of one or more of the elements - both intended and not. In contrast, the desired result of “storytelling” is taking you on an emotional or intellectual journey by transporting you from state A to state B.  

>In clothing, that may manifest in simply the form of 'professional' (the working woman), 'casually put together' (the busy mom), 'chic' (the fashionista) - maybe those genres are really the best story achievable by the every day person.

I absolutely think that these archetypes are simple ways for women to tell stories through their clothing without having to be experts on fashion or any other related subject. Of course not everyone is trying to tell a story when they get dressed, some are just trying to signal or leave an impression. More thinking out loud - even if women aren’t trying to tell a story *through* their clothes many tell stories *with* their clothes. To clarify: they dress themselves as if *they* are in a story and the clothes support their character. The archetypes come in handy here as well as they fit into personal narratives.

Western women are so ungrateful for the economic, political, and cultural awesomeness that gives them this unique environment to comfortably complain haha!",20,FeminineNotFeminist
"My thoughts on the concept of storytelling as described in your post:

* I think that when people use the term “storytelling” they usually mean ""communicates a cohesive message that elicits emotion within the observer"". Specifically a message that attempts to transport or expand the perspective of the receiver. Going from state A to B provides the illusion of narrative. We innately desire these sorts of experiences; storytelling has been part of human culture since the beginning of our existence. In an increasingly digital and detached age it isn’t surprising that we’d yearn for authentic human connection. I believe that the emphasis on “storytelling” is a manifestation of something primal. 

* The trend of elevating ""storytelling"" in mainstream pop culture mirrors and contributes to the way we elevate the subjective over the objective. We see this in competitions dealing with anything aesthetic. In many cases emotions and personal experiences are considered equal to if not superior than objective beauty  color theory, ratios, proportion, history, the principles of art, skill, etc. On Project Runway, if a garment looks terrible or has poor construction but it excelled in ""storytelling"" designers won’t even get kicked off. I am not sure if the word “storytelling” was specifically used this past season but Mah - Jing absolutely benefitted from his strength as a storyteller, he wasn’t a good designer or sewer imo. 

I think our ability to glean both information and emotion from inanimate objects is amazing. I also think we can tell stories through any medium. Some obvious examples: a runway show, a symphony, or the mise en scene of a film. Things like meals at restaurants or everyday clothing choices can also tell stories, their small scale makes this less obvious, but the audience is also more targeted. 

Using fashion as an example - the nuances of different brands, styles, combinations, materials, silhouettes, etc. can be lost on those outside of your target audience. Someone unfamiliar with the world of fashion would just see your ensemble as “clothes” whereas those who know the subject in depth would respond on some level to your choices. 

A good example of this is in The Devil Wears Prada. The wardrobe selections and settings for Andy vs the fashion-minded tell her story even without the explicit dialogue. [In one of the best moments Miranda breaks down the context behind one of Andy’s outfits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj8mHwvFxMc). In this scene you can see that Andy cannot understand the stories that they are trying to tell through fashion due to her lack of knowledge on the subject, which is reflected both in her reactions and her own clothing choices. Miranda’s monologue also hints at the way runway collections - like all things - can be in conversation with each other, each building on innovations and adding ideas to the collective body of stories told through clothing.

"Disagreeing is fine but I hope you can understand that the source of the conflict was the approach that you took when disagreeing. Do you know your MBTI? I don’t believe that you were intentionally trying to be awful or anything, I think there were lots of misunderstandings due to our different cognitive functions/ways of processing information. 

Now that you’ve expanded on your statements about her business approach your earlier claims don’t seem so ridiculous but without that context you seemed like you didn’t understand that her website is literally how business is done today. I’m not a fan of the approach either but I don’t think it invalidates her ideas. Whereas you *seemed* to be claiming that *because* she uses X normal tactics, all of her ideas are bad. 

Your first two comments to me gave no indication that you actually understood the argument that was being made in the article or my comments. You spoke about generalisations and how things didn’t apply to you personally. You also brushed aside the issue at hand by saying that people are different and everyone gets stressed. It was not clear that you even understood the idea that male and female nature makes both genders better suited for different things. 

From my (and others’) perspective there is a gap between what you were trying to do and what you actually ended up doing. Your statements weren’t just disagreeing with the article they misconstrued and/or missed the point the point of the article. If you had written a comment sharing your personal perspective but in a way that made it clear that you got the post and just personally didn’t have the same experiences, that would be one thing.

We always encourage women to post what they want and share what they are interested in but there are definitely more women who lurk than submit content. And the number of women who regularly write OC is very small. This doesn’t mean that the subjects aren’t welcome on the subreddit. I personally don’t write about that topic since it doesn’t have anything to do with my life or experiences so what would I even say? I think in general more women here are comfortable having discussions in the comments vs writing full posts.

These women literally need to bite their tongue and practise not controlling every little detail. For someone who doesn't struggle with that issue all the advice can seem extreme but really these women have to retrain their minds and that can only happen if they put in the effort and really think before acting.

This is why I said it didn't seem like you were that familiar with the sub - and I don't expect everyone to automatically know that this is going on! 

The delay on the other post(s) is due to life and also coming to new conclusions about things. I make it very clear in 1.5 that H and L aren't inherently good or bad, but since this is RPW the series is both a general theory and geared towards being applicable by women here in their relationships. H women absolutely need to have psychological femininity and yield to their men which *in general* comes easier for L women. L women have their own set of issues which also get discussed across the community. There is a significant population of H women who come to RPW and need to work on not being controlling, micromanaging, nagging, distrustful, etc. So that is why my series initially focused on that aspect of H women.

"The way that Renee runs her website is pretty standard in terms of bloggers who also have books and services. There is nothing illegal about it, she is not revolutionary or scammy, she is just doing what plenty of other bloggers do to make money. She uses language and techniques that are commonly recommended if you read any modern resource on online marketing. 

It isn’t predatory or shady to attempt to appeal to your reader by identify an issue/need in their life. She is trying to capture her target audience just like any other business. If you’re not part of her target demo the message isn’t going to have the impact that she wants. I don’t have love life issues so I just ignore her calls to action and get the information that I do like from the site. Giving people some information and saving the best info for your larger (monetized) product is business 101. Additionally presenting yourself as an expert on a subject to give people a reason to buy your product is also business 101. She has a specific perspective and is putting in effort to share that message with other women who may benefit from it. I think that qualifies her to do what she is doing as much as anyone else can start a business selling whatever service or skill someone would pay for.

Your initial comment to me gave the impression that you were in fact offended. I arrived at this conclusion because of the way you personalised everything. Every single claim or piece of advice from the article was refuted due to its irrelevance to your specific situation. The intensity of your comment also supported my perception of your offense. Your word choice and overall tone read as emotional, and the way you constantly compared yourself to the hypothetical women described by Renee made it seem like you felt insulted and angered by her words.

Taking this most recent response into account, I believe that it is female solipsism that is preventing you to grasp the purpose of the article and what I am saying. It is possible to recognise that something can be true and useful for others, without it having to apply to you. You don’t seem to be able to understand the extent to which other women process things differently from you which I will expand on as I continue replying to your statements. 

>But, when I read Renee's article, at the end I took away the message ""women can't work, because their women.""

This is a very odd takeaway from the post. She specifically wrote about women who are in the *male* workforce, which is not the same as “women who work” in general. The message that I received, that other women who read also understood, is:

 In general, women do not thrive in the male workforce because it requires a specific set of skills and traits and most women have a different set of skills and traits due to the innate and biological differences between the genders. The male workforce is designed for men and women have only recently joined it in large numbers. Many women who have jobs in these fields are *not* fulfilled by their roles and in fact the environment is draining, depressing, exhausting, and all sorts of other negative things. This is *not* due to everyday stress and burnout. This is because they are ill suited for the role. 

Being able to perform an action is not the only requirement for success in a job. There are specific mindsets, attitudes, habits, character traits, demeanors, and even lifestyles that are necessary for the best performance. Plenty of men can change a diaper and read a book to their child but *hate* the idea of being a stay at home dad who does 24/7 care of their children. This doesn’t mean that they are bad fathers or bad people, they just thrive in different environments due to their nature.  It also doesn’t mean that every single man is incapable of being a SAHD. But we can speak in generalities because there is a bell curve when it comes to how masculine (or feminine) one is and most people are located right next to or near the “average” zone for masculinity (or femininity).

>I do not support the assertion that working outside of the home is automatically masculine.

Neither does RPW, and neither does Renee from what I can tell. I haven’t read every post on her site, just the ones that I’ve linked to RPW so I will only speak about the RPW position right now. 

* Women have *always* worked, there is just a difference between traditionally female jobs and traditionally male jobs. 

* You can be employed without being a “career woman” 

80% of the time when people online in this ‘sphere talk about women working they are talking about “career women” in male dominated fields. This can be inferred by looking at context clues. So many women today are pushed into fields where they don’t really thrive, and they feel bad about being unable to succeed 100%. These women blame themselves and an article like this is important to show that it isn’t a failure on their part.

>The way one approaches having a career can be masculine, but it can also be feminine. It just depends on the mind frame from which you approach the situation.

Sure but this was an article for and about women who are more on the feminine side who feel crushed from their job because it requires a lot of masculine characteristics. I know of at least one post on RPW about being feminine in the (male) workplace and people discuss it all the time on the sub. The article that I submitted is an addition to the conversation, not a stand alone theory of everything. It’s only discussing a tiny piece of the situation and I appreciate that limited scope. 

>Renee makes sweeping generalization in her article. It is not directed towards one type of woman, but to all women.

Yes she does make generalisations but again they aren’t *universal* statements. It’s pretty understood that when you say “men are like X” and “women are like Y” you don’t literally mean every single man or woman with zero exceptions and no nuance. The whole point of a general statement is to be general. They are useful when relaying big ideas.

>Everyone operates in the world differently. Everyone can tolerate different levels of stress. And, different things make different people happy.

Okay but do you understand that there is a *fundamental* difference between male and female nature. And that women who have average to high levels of femininity can struggle in male areas specifically because of these innate differences. You seem to be shrugging off the crux of the article. “Different things make different people happy” is true but we can go a step further. We can look at what types of things make most women happy, and what types of things make most men happy. There is nothing wrong with examining the preferences, strengths, and weaknesses, of each sex. We can look at the trends and patterns and form theories, generalisations, and hueristics. That helps you take the big pile of raw information and make it actionable. 

>I enjoy my feminine role in a masculine workplace. What makes you think I never operate in a support role? Or that I never utilize my nurturing side in the office?

This is what I mean by you misinterpreting. I actually specifically stated that you in fact did thrive in your workplace, something that I only could claim based on reading your own testimony to that fact. Me talking about what other women are like =/= me saying that you are *not* like that. 

>Again, where did I state that I cannot be vulnerable? Or that I need to have direct control of all things, people, and situations? 

Another example of solipsism. If I am explaining the characteristics of a different group of women, I am *not* asserting that you lack all of those traits. Low dominance in women travels with a suite of traits, just as high dominance in women travels with a different suite of traits. That does not mean that it is impossible for an H woman to have L traits or vice versa. H and L women aren’t characterised by those other traits, we are just speaking about patterns and probabilities. The L and H system differentiates between dominance level and *that* is the dividing line, your location on the spectrum just makes you more likely to have other traits. As an example, a high dominant woman is more likely to be comfortable with confrontation. This does not mean that all H women are comfortable with confrontation, it does not mean that no L women can be comfortable with confrontation. One’s degree of comfort with confrontation does not determine one’s dominance level. But we can absolutely look at the traits that one has and use that to infer dominance level. 

>I'm very familiar with RPW ideas, but do not buy into the idea that you can't have a career and a wonderful, loving RPW relationship.

You are familiar with RPW but think that we believe that women can’t work or succeed in the workplace? You realise that most of the women on the sub are employed right? There is a difference between being a career obsessed bitch and succeeding at work. And as I said before there is a difference between a job and a career. Not all women *need* to have careers, and not all women want one even if they are afraid to admit it to themselves. Feminism has made the idea of careers and career women the norm, the ideal even in some circles. It is important to show women that this isn’t the only option. It is refreshing for many to read something like this that tells them that it is okay that they are different. 

The message clearly wasn’t for you but hopefully now you can see exactly what was and wasn’t being said, and why something like this is both RP and welcome on the sub.

"Yes I found this thought provoking as well! 

It actually connected with an idea I've been thinking about: men can improve themselves and become more masculine through hard work, labour, sacrifice, etc. which often includes things that take a physical toll. I think women can improve themselves and become more feminine by doing things like self care, prioritising appearance, cooking etc. These activities require feminine traits and skills such as being patient, having an eye for beauty, taking things slower, being nurturing, etc. It takes discipline and responsibility to commit to regular self care or cooking really well. I think that it's a better way for women to develop the skills that mature adults should have without losing their softness. Basically challenging themselves within the female sphere. Hope that makes sense!

99% of photos on professional websites are photoshopped. How does that make someone a con artist? Plenty of women have go-to poses and end up looking similar in photos, again how is this shady? She likely has success from having a consistent brand and image. Women can remember her if they see similar images wherever she is mentioned - this is standard for those whose identity and business are intertwined.

[You sound like an H woman who is taking offense at a message for L women.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/comments/4ep0xh/relationship_dynamics_part_one_updated_expanded/) Are you aware that there are hundreds of thousands of women who are working in environments that go against their nature, and they struggle and blame themselves, not realising that it is okay to be different than H women? In your personal experience you simply get stressed, deal with it, and move on. But there are women that this does not work for, because they are different from you!

Don’t read her *general* statements about *many* women as *universal* statements about *all* women. **You** thrive under pressure. Plenty of women don’t and a post like this is a relief to them. And when other women aren’t thriving it isn’t always a simple case of “burnout”. And the surrender that she is talking about resonates with L women. It’s not a desire to defer to all men in a romantic way, we just operate within the world differently. 

There are posts about what this means throughout the sub but an obvious way to contrast is that while you personally enjoy your active role in the masculine workplace, a lot of women thrive when they are in supportive positions that require nurturing skills. When it comes to non professional relationships, L women are more comfortable with vulnerability and not being directly in control of all things, people, and situations. This is something that H women tend to struggle with. If you’re not familiar with RPW ideas or Renee’s work then I understand why you wouldn’t know the connotations and larger context.

"Please read[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/comments/5hz4md/female_sexual_strategy/) and the other top RPW posts they'll help you with dating! Also I wasn't around today and I really don't feel like countering every single comment but do look at what I did say about Tinder and similar sites in the comments that I did leave. Best of luck with everything, write a Field Report if something interesting/awesome happens :)",1,RedPillWives
You're fine!,2,RedPillWives
Haha of course <3,2,RedPillWives
This might just be because I'm LH but I feel like a man who would sign up for a dating site where women initiate wouldn't be the best in terms of leadership and dominance. The app just sounds like more female entitlement and I have the same criticisms for it that I do for Tinder in terms of removing the romance and everything else I said in other comment sections. ,3,RedPillWives
"I'm not talking about a ""meet cute"" when I use the term ""romance"". Tinder and similar programs make the entire process of being ""on the market"" and trying to find a man way more clinical, less personal. When it is a major part of your dating strategy it hampers your ability to have real life chemistry in my opinion because you concentrate your energy on doing well online/with the apps which requires different traits than more organic methods of dating. 

It also changes your perspective in terms of your estimation of your SMV and RMV - most guys swipe to approve nearly every woman, or they send messages to multiple women because they are looking for the quickest lay/any chance of success. Additionally having that power in your hand to say yes or no so officially reinforces a sense of entitlement. Also just thinking off the top of my head, it removes some of the need for insecurity because you aren't there face to face when you first talk so you don't have to put in as much effort in terms of connecting/charming them into the date. Text isn't the same as body language, appearance, facial expressions, laughter, etc.

Even if you personally have a good relationship from Tinder, it doesn't mean that the app is a great option for single women looking to get married ASAP and have a traditional/RP dynamic. And I think that this whole comment section is filled with a lot of hamstering and female solipsism. ",0,RedPillWives
"No you weren't being an asshole, and I'm so glad you were here to represent the RP perspective! 

RPW has women at all levels of knowledge and experience and no one will learn or improve if others don't point them in the right direction. Posts like this actually demonstrate why a this sub is necessary - left to their own devices not all women will figure out what to do to get what they want. And how can they when no one in their lives or mainstream culture is giving them the truth or calling them out? Tinder is so normalised and even expected in some circles so this is a valid question for single women to ask. Online dating and dating/hook up apps are a feature of the modern SMP so we can't ignore it - it just takes more than one person to combat the hamsters lol 

I'm not sure if you saw but [I wrote a post on female sexual strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/comments/5hz4md/female_sexual_strategy/) that breaks down the reasons behind what we advise on RPW, feel free to link it to women on this sub, or even PPD if it comes up :)",2,RedPillWives
"Exactly you are spot on as usual! RPW is about female sexual *strategy* and it rarely is *optimal* for a woman to use her time, energy, and resources to try to convince men who aren't interested in settling down, to settle down with her. Beta orbiting is the perfect parallel so hopefully drawing the comparison makes it click for women. ",2,RedPillWives
I'm talking about serious exclusive relationships (so over one year and also living together) and marriage. The most important thing though when it comes to discussion on RPW is how likely it is that a relationship will lead to marriage. I'm sure plenty of people meet men that they date through Tinder. How many of these relationships last longer than 1 year? How many lead to marriage? How many have RP dynamics?,1,RedPillWives
">surely then it'll be more difficult to lock down any attractive guy who has tinder in the first place regardless of how you met him, since the presence of options will make it so that he is less likely to commit to any one option at all?

Yes and the only way you'll be able to lock most of these men down is by giving away your resources (sex, time, attention, etc) disproportionately to his level of investment. It just doesn't make sense for women interested in RPW. You can get RMV5+ men outside of Tinder who are actually looking to settle down in the near future. ",2,RedPillWives
">TBH I think the real motive of this thread is more like ""how do I get the hot dudes from tinder to commit"" and tinder is the place that will landslide the most options in attractive men's favor, making the odds of an LTR very low.

Yes!",3,RedPillWives
"In America Tinder has the reputation of being a place for flings and NSA sex. It is not the most optimal route for most women in terms of getting a man and that is why we don't advocate it on this sub.  

I also don't like it because it completely removes the romance from the dating process. It is way less personal and I think it warps the way people think about dating and relationships. Also I think it's one step removed from a website advertising escorts. You're basically putting yourself out there saying you are DTF when you are on Tinder. It reduces many women to the sex that they can offer, which really is all that some women can offer so it is fitting I suppose. 

A woman with an RMV over 5 should be able to get an man without Tinder, so why even waste time with the app. ",2,RedPillWives

There is a lot to like about this product: it sets my makeup wonderfully, especially my undereye concealer. It doesn't cause my skin to increase oil production and it does a reasonable job at limiting shine. I have normal/combo skin that gets slightly oily in the summer (T Zone), slightly dry in the winter (cheeks). I used to think I had combo/oily skin but it turns out it was just dehydrated! 

The two cons that I can think of for the product: the packaging gets dirty easily, and as a whole it's kind of boring. It performs great I just don't get excited about it.

"Yep Bright Winters can have dark eyes but they'd be super intensely dark. If you can pull off blonde highlights I'm not sure what that says about your BW status. Highlights reduce the contrast between your features and BWs and winters in general are all about contrast. 

The site I'm about to link to I'm not sure if it officially uses the Sci/Art system but it is a very good introductory site that could help you figure out where you belong. [This is their page on Winters](http://www.thechicfashionista.com/winter-color-analysis.html), and [here is their page on Summers](http://www.thechicfashionista.com/summer-color-analysis.html). Maybe you're a Deep/Dark Winter since that contrast level is medium-high?",1,FeminineNotFeminist
Awesome :D,1,FeminineNotFeminist
"The Dark Winter palette isn't actually brown though, it just has more brown in the shades. Not sure how to explain. [Here is DW](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/4c/72/0f/4c720f41e159ee67c1b511909063475b.jpg), [here is BW](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KzzGu_dY4A4/Vvk30h2vQ2I/AAAAAAAAEN0/Q8uf6vfGQGYZXwSPwBfkOVRIANHIPxx8Q/s400/bright%2Bwinter.jpg). See what I mean? If you wear some of the brighter and bolder colours of the DW palette you'll definitely pop. Did you read the blog post I linked about the 4 subcategories within each season? You should figure yours out! 

Also to clarify it's not that it's impossible to pull off other seasons it just depends on where you start and which season you're trying to become. For many you could dye your hair, tan, and change your makeup look and successfully pass. People do this all the time. But I feel like it would be really hard to go from DW to BW especially considering your coloring. 

From both personal experience and what I've read over the years studying SCA when you embrace your palette and find the shades and combinations that you enjoy, you look your absolute best. Even if it looks boring (or in my case intimidating) just try it on and see! If DW doesn't end up fitting maybe you're a [Bright Spring](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ggoM9JTBSa4/Vvk3_fz9iEI/AAAAAAAAEN4/9QMvOuTXQWMMTTKz8h3C9b_GAfV1je-dw/s1600/bright%2Bspring.jpg) after all, which is the closest to BW and could explain why you're drawn to it.

"It might just be the lighting but you read more neutral-cool to me. Either way your dominant feature is definitely Deep and you seem to be on the higher end of medium contrast. Both Dark Autumn and Dark Winter are medium - high in chroma. Let's assume you're right and it's just a lighting issue so you're neutral-warm, also putting you in the Dark/Deep Autumn camp. Since you are drawn to the softer shades maybe that is also indicative of your Autumn status? [Here is the Deep Autumn palette](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/33/f8/34/33f83475c54245723e9884909d47fca8.jpg), what do you think? There is definitely something really subdued about you at least in these photos. If you were to go to a consultant in real life she would drape different colours over you to see which ones look best. Take another look at the clothes you have and see which shades make you look the best! ",2,FeminineNotFeminist
"You're welcome, so glad it was helpful!",1,FeminineNotFeminist
"Nope each type has distinct hair, eye, and skin traits and it affects the types of clothes you can wear (not just the colours but the textures and level of detail). When people dye their hair to a shade within their palette they still look great but if they go outside of their palette they often have to do tons more work to look normal. 

From what I've been reading Dark Winter has a lot of brown in it that Bright Winter just doesn't have. Your pictures definitely confirm this, I have a darker skintone than you do but you seem ""browner"" (and I'm BW). Another big part of BW is the eyes, I'm not sure how that could be replicated by a non clear type.

Excellent tip! Did you read the article I linked about why there are only 12 seasons in the Sci/Art system? I'm curious to hear your thoughts :) ,1,FeminineNotFeminist
You're welcome and wow that's so cool that your wardrobe matches your season already!,2,FeminineNotFeminist
"In the Sci/Art system there is no Deep/Clear/Warm category because that isn't something that is found in nature. Other systems have other combinations and categories that go beyond the 12 systems, but I trust Sci/Art the most and included a great article about why 12 is the best number of categories. 

There are two options that you have to consider here:

Are you sure you are Clear? Based on what you've shared that's the first one I'd question. What makes you think you are clear and not soft? How does your skin react not only to high chroma colors but to pure black and pure white? If you feel like you are medium chroma with neutral - warm undertones, you may be a Deep Autumn. Does that palette match you well? 

I'd also question if you are actually Deep and not Light. While your actual colors are the easiest way to determine your season, a large part of it is looking at how fabric colors react with your coloring. I'm not a professional by any means but I've read enough blog posts and forum conversations to see multiple cases of women who look so different than the standard type. If you are Light, Clear, and Warm, that would put you in the spring category. Since we know that Warm isn't your dominant characteristic, you'd most likely be Bright/Clear Spring. 

If none of that helps, /u/onacasserole gave a great tip in her comment about seeing how the yellows look on you.

I said this in another comment but to modernize the examples think about the instagram/YT beauty guru looks that are popular today.

I don't think anyone here has really asked the OP the right questions to get a better sense of her situation. There are always multiple possibilities and solutions. It's not just ""silently put up with it"" or ""leave him ASAP"".

"She agreed to this dynamic and has been doing 80% for years. Why would her man suddenly want something different just because she does?

"Bashing another member's SO is **not** okay. You are contributing to a mindset of disrespect within the OP - a woman who is not seeking an RPW solution to her situation. She signed up for this relationship and has contributed to this dynamic for years. She isn't a victim and she isn't infinitely better than her man just because she wants something different than he does. 

We should be questioning her judgement, calling her out for wanting to change her man, pointing out her errors in general, and identifying multiple solutions instead of just leaving. You're just taking her at her word and immediately assuming she is in the right and he is in the wrong. 

If the differences truly are irreconcilable and she can't continue committing to a man who she claims she loves and wants to spend the rest of her life with then okay. But you can suggest that the OP move on from the relationship without tearing her man down and inflating her ego. ",8,RedPillWives
"I posted the Rules Revisited link to the sub and added [these thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/FeminineNotFeminist/comments/5tu0do/how_to_avoid_looking_fake/ddozcan/), wanted to give you more context to the post. Basically skilled application of products is what matters, and you can't fixate on the number. ",3,FeminineNotFeminist
"Such a great post! Two things I want to add: 

* In the before and after photos the women are wearing the *same amount* of makeup. The choices are better and therefore the women look better. X number of products isn't automatically bad, but people notice when you've used a lot of makeup poorly. He talks about this in a followup post but I wanted to make sure that everyone here noticed! The reason that the women don't look as good is because the makeup doesn't harmonise with their features so it is jarring. It is possible for them to wear dramatic looks but not in the way that they did in those photos. 

* He has an anti plastic surgery slant to this post that I do not share at all. Plenty of women get work done without anyone even noticing, it's similar to the point I just made about makeup. Two women can have the same procedure done but one can look natural and the other can look fake. It's all about the choices made leading up to the surgery. ",7,FeminineNotFeminist
"I've learned that things that seem unnatural when described can actually appear natural when you actually have it on your face. And at the moment, it looks unbalanced which isn't ideal if you're going for a natural look! 

If you did something like tightlining, an extra coat of mascara, and a subtle light brown in the crease your eyes would look enhanced but anyone looking at you wouldn't be able to pick out why. As for bronzing or contouring, light contouring would keep you looking natural, bronzing would make you look more tan, so it's up to you. Some people can use bronzer as contour so maybe you'll be able to pull that off. All the step requires is a light dusting along your hair line - 7 seconds at the most. 

There's no magic number that defines the ideal amount of products one should use on a daily basis. I use quite more than you do every time I do my makeup because I do what it takes to get the results that I want. [Here is a great post that talks about makeup, effort, and not looking fake.](http://www.therulesrevisited.com/2012/05/how-to-avoid-looking-fake.html)

Some CC: more eye shadow/liner/mascara on your eyelids/upper lashline. It looks unbalanced at the moment. It's possible that the camera just isn't picking up the product but it's something to consider. You could also amp up the intensity on your blush and lip product just a little bit, it would really enhance your features. Do you have any contouring or bronzing products?

Did you know that you can have a free consultation at most department stores? You can tell the stylist what you're looking for and your budget and they'll pick things out for you and you can try them on and get immediate feedback. 

Since mall stores have more focused aesthetics it'd be helpful to know more about your style.

"I mentioned this in a different thread but I always start my makeup application by doing my brows, and if I'm wearing a bolder lipstick that becomes the first step before brows. When I paint I make sure to put my ""darkest dark"" somewhere on the canvas to ensure that I don't accidentally make things that are supposed to be of medium value too dark. Similarly when you apply your brows and/or dark lipstick first it prevents you from going too heavy with eyeshadow, blush, and other products. It also takes focus away from imperfections and reduces the likelihood that you'll overdo it with foundation and concealer. ",10,FeminineNotFeminist
"This is wonderful! I'll be making a wiki page in the near future to spotlight the wonderful original content that FNF members create. This post will totally be featured :) 

I think that while youth is glorified in the mainstream, it is often women 30 - 50 who are hailed as beauty icons in magazines and in pop culture in general. A lot of aging celebrities are clinging to their status and we see their PR teams working overtime to perpetuate the brand of these older women as the ultimate ideal. An example of this would be the various ""hottest women in America"" lists that show up yearly in magazines. There is rarely a celebrity under 25 listed! 

I'm saying all of this *not* to say that women over 30 can't be beautiful or sexually attractive, but to say that a lot of women under 30 are taught that they need to aspire to look like whichever older woman is currently popular. There is this weird thing happening where the older trendsetters are trying to look younger, and the young women copy these older women even though they have *exactly* what these stars are after. It's kind of similar to how women copy drag queens when applying makeup, when all drag techniques are designed to make male faces look more feminine! 

I love the advice that you've given in this post and hope that it is helpful for the younger women reading. I'm 22 myself and love that I can experiment and have fun with my looks in a way that 14 year olds and 60 year old women can't.

"Great questions!

* I wear a full face of makeup every time I do my makeup. Almost every possible category from primer to setting spray with the exception of bronzing and contouring products. I also don't wear false lashes on a regular basis due to having long + curled lashes naturally. 

* I think the word that most YouTube gurus would use is ""natural glam"". It isn't casual or subtle, but it's not avant garde, creative, or even formal. My features are enhanced and it's clear that I'm wearing makeup. I look polished but flirty at the same time. 

* M doesn't know anything about makeup but he gives me feedback if I try something new. He likes cat eyes, smokey eyes, and red lipstick so I definitely do these when I want to look sexy for him. He likes my everyday makeup as well it just isn't as arousing - which is the point lol, not trying to attract people when I'm out and about! 

* I wear makeup to look more attractive to myself, my man, and others in general. I also really enjoy the process of applying it and have fun researching new products and techniques. 

* I am always in search of HG products for every category. I don't care about having a full, varied makeup wardrobe. I'd rather have one perfect product for each thing that I need. I'm not a fan of minimalism at all so don't think that this is about having the bare minimum. I just want to have exactly what I want and no less :) In terms of techniques I definitely want to keep growing in my skills and really maximise each feature on my face.

* I'd lose manicures in a heartbeat, I'm so obsessed w/ lipstick at the moment. Bullet lipsticks are so amazing you guys!

"This is totally because I paint but I always do my brows and then one coat of mascara first because it's like establishing my ""darkest dark"" and I can use it as a guide when doing the rest of my look. It prevents me from going too intense with my eyeshadow because I have a reference point w/ the black colours already on my face. Also when wearing a bold lip I apply that prior to doing my blush and eye look. The same principle applies. If I'm wearing a bold lip I don't want the rest of my face to compete. When I have it done first I can make sure everything else complements it.

Also I find that when I put on the darkest things first it makes the imperfections on my face less noticeable and I don't go overboard with foundation and concealer! ",3,FeminineNotFeminist

When it came to face makeup, I found that completely ignoring the trends and getting a bright berry/raspberry shade and wearing it all over my cheeks was the way to go.

* Body Lines - straight, vertical

* Body Type - skeletal but not extremely so, possibly skeletal/muscular  

* Face Lines - I see diagonal and horizontal lines on the inside, vertical for the perimeter

* Facial Features - eyes and nose are large mouth is small but long, cheeks and forehead also large, but chin is small. This is totally part of the gamine look your features seem ""pointy"" if that makes sense. Since you have both large and small features and also large and close together spacing, you can do a lot with prints!

* Texture - Medium

"Definitely not! When you match your appearance to your demeanor/personality/vibe/essence you look your best. It wouldn't balance you out to dress more simply it would make you look tired, uncomfortable, or some other unwanted thing. 

I was so worried when I started adopting things from all the wardrobe resources that I was reading. I'm a: Bright Winter, Theatrical Romantic, Type 1, mix of vertical + curved + straight lines, skeletal/molded, high complexity, med texture. Those are all very bold, animated types. (I'll be writing about those other systems in the future for sure). When I put on a bright pink floral dress and did more intense makeup to match my high contrast colouring, and also styled my hair in big bombshell curls - I was so self conscious! I thought I looked like a prostitute lol

But when I took a step back I realised that I had reached a level of visual harmony that I wasn't before. Everything just worked so well together and I felt *energized*. M loved it of course and when I go out dressed entirely like all my types I am my most confident and radiant self. 

In the tube my lipstick was intimidating but on my lips it looked amazing. On the hanger the dress looked overwhelming but on my body it looked perfectly natural. The more I embrace all my various types the more amazing I feel. I think you'll experience the same esp if you put together different systems.

A lot of times we add on all these extra standards that while our men do appreciate, they also would be fine with the more basic version. One example is cooking dinner. Plenty of women go all out with ingredients, techniques, variety, etc. and plenty of men would be fine eating the same 4 meals on rotation!

"> I find that his workouts put me off and seem really unsustainable in that there are lots of new exercises being implemented often, and all the time to get it right would probably add up and take far too long :/

I've done Strong Curves multiple times and didn't have this experience at all. The very first time I did it I had zero weight room experience, I was a dancer so that was my main means of exercise). Not only does he explain every exercise in the appendix it just takes a quick google search for any moves you're uncertain about and there are hundreds of videos showing you how to do it. I did not find anything complicated or confusing, just new and something to learn. 

You do each phase for a month so you're going to do specific exercises at minimum once a week, at maximum 2 times a week.

* [Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum](http://www.sephora.com/c-firma-day-serum-P400259) - The hype is real you guys this is the BEST vitamin C serum I have ever used! Lovely packaging, easy to apply, doesn't feel sticky, smells pleasant, noticeable results (have been using it for 1 month), and it seems like it will last a while. It claims to work on your skin for 72 hours so I use it every other morning and it performs better than vit C serums that I was using daily.

It emulsifies beautifully and removes all 400 layers of makeup that I have on haha My skin feels soft afterwards and this has not clogged my pores or lead to acne (which I am prone to so if anyone else has a similar issue, this is a safe product).

"Of course! 
 
To respond to your qs about cultures: I’d have to know what communities these are. Are the people US white (descended from the settlers + first waves of immigrants), US black (ancestors came when US practised slavery), or ethnically of european descent? What religious affiliations? Christianity, Judaism, Atheism, some other thing related to those 3? If what you’re thinking of is *not* part of any of those groups I mentioned,  it is not part of what RPW officially deals with. I may think of a group that I left out so that list isn’t set in stone, but you can get the idea of where our focus lies. Individual women can read and apply RPW stuff to their own personal lives but it is not written with them in mind nor are the ideas based on groups other than the ones that I listed. 

What culture is this? And what ages are these things applied to? Parents have the right to decide if their children can work or go to school (up until 18 unless the child is emancipated) and I also agree with the right of parents to enforce rules about sex and contraception with their children. Are adults forcing adult women to abide by these standards? Are there physical consequences or just social expectation and risk of ostracization? 

I don’t have enough information to speak to the situation that you describe but as a general rule I think that the US law should apply to all cultures equally. Everything that you listed being disallowed/banned is legal so I disagree with adults literally forcing other adults to act in ways they don’t want to. I’m all about free will and personal autonomy. But cultural norms and traditions are not the same thing as force. If people choose to go along with what others want due to a sense of obligation, they may feel unhappy about it but it is their choice. So I don’t think the law comes into play and don’t think the law *should* come into play in those sorts of situations. 

I can’t get into detail beyond this without knowing the culture because I do not believe that all cultures are equal and I have different feelings and thoughts on each one and their place within America. Keep in mind that culture =/= ethnic group, race, individual. I make judgements about values, traditions, norms, practices, etc. and don’t believe in cultural or moral relativism. This does not mean that I believe that any individual people are intrinsically better than others. I am talking about ideas and group actions not inherent value of a person. 

>Feminism, to me, is not the mandate that women HAVE to do both, but rather that she has the choice to do either, both or none. 

[Here is a comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/muacjdiscussion/comments/5rqsn9/red_pill_women_made_their_own_beauty_sub_lets/ddbc8p8/) I wrote to someone else in this comment section about the definition of feminism. It’s more than the idea of equality and choices for women. Also have you read anything by feminist thinkers or heard what even everyday feminists have said, both now and in the past, about female choice? There are absolutely things that feminists don’t believe that women should be able to choose. Many second wave thinkers didn’t even want women to be able to choose being a SAHM! Recently feminists have made it clear that you can’t choose to be pro life/anti abortion and also a feminist. 

I totally get that you are saying that *for you* feminism is about choice. And I am aware that other women also feel this way. To be clear I am *not* saying that you agree with the women I mentioned earlier simply for being a feminist. Just brought that up to hear your thoughts. My objections to feminism are not based on whether or not women are able to choose their own life path while still being under the feminist umbrella. 

>So If you want to be traditionalist or not, that's your choice.

And what would “being traditionalist” mean if one was feminist? It is impossible to hold all of the traditionalist opinions and values and simultaneously hold feminist opinions and values. Many are mutually exclusive especially since a lot of feminism was developed as a rejection of traditional Western values. So what does this statement really mean? If you take away the incompatible parts of the ideology and cultural practices, what are you left with? Appearance, music choices, some relationships, some life choices that don’t affect anyone else. 

This stripped down version is not an example of freedom. It reminds me of how a lot of people on the left claim to want diversity when really they want everyone to think the same and only have variety when it comes to things that are inconsequential in the big picture. Example: to leftists it is fine when black people listen to hip hop, wear street fashion, eat southern food, use slang, etc. But if they deviate from the set of values that liberals hold in high esteem, they are absolutely vilified. Not sure if you’ve seen conservative black men called “Uncle Toms” and “mediocre negros” but this sort of policing also happens to women who deviate too far from the approved list of ideas.   

>So my question to you, is how to you feel about these subcultures, communities where women are not given a choice to think critically or where the choice to be traditionalist/non traditionalist is not given? Do you think something should be done?

As I said earlier it depends on the culture as well as what you mean by “not given a choice”. The education system in America absolutely needs work and I think if that were improved people would be better equipped to make their own decisions. This would be done by returning power to the states and counties instead of having terrible federal curriculums. Outside of a few subcultures women in America actually *do* have a choice and while all paths are not easy they can still go their own way and design the life they want. I think that restoring a lot of power to the local level would incentivise community organizations, churches, and charities to be more involved and these groups could be a good resource for young women as well. Some people are born into shitty situations, but almost all of them don’t have to stay there. There is no perfect solution though, and I personally am not a fan of the government legislating so many aspects of our lives. 

>how does RPW deal with homosexuality/bisexualism, trans issues, etc.

RPW is focused on heterosexual relationships between biological men and biological women who identify and present as their natural sex and gender. We don’t really talk about things outside of this scope because it is outside of the purpose of the community. I do know that there are a few bisexual women who use the information on the sub, and a few poly people as well. There are many aspects of RP that are descriptive about human nature, gender dynamics, and the sexual market place. This information could be useful for anyone regardless of how they identify. I have no idea how useful information for straight women on how to appeal to straight men could be used by gay people or trans and I don’t particularly care about the subject so it’s not something I plan on investigating myself. 

>If your son were to tell you he was homosexual, therefore making it basically impossible for him to form a ""traditional"" family. How would you react?

I would be upset and give him resources about traditional Catholic men who are homosexual but choose not to pursue a gay lifestyle. If that failed I would hope that he was as awesome as Milo Yiannopoulos and I’d encourage it. I would not support him if he also decided he was a leftist. 

>Same if your daughter was a lesbian, if she is not out trying to get a guy at the top of his window...then how would the RPW community and yourself deal with this? 

The same thing applies - traditional Catholic route as first attempt, then I’d just encourage and support avoiding leftist and gay culture. The RPW community has nothing to say on the subject, this is my personal opinion and other members have their own personal opinions. Many of the RPW members are totally fine with gay ppl so they’ll be more accepting than me I’m sure.  

-------

I wrote in another comment why we don’t allow trans women, the main reason is because it would disrupt the cohesion of the community. Here are the points I brought up: 

* Women who otherwise value honest constructive criticism and feedback feel compelled to praise trans women for average or even subpar makeup looks, hairstyles, fashion choices, etc. 

* Women who believe that trans women are not actually women would get into arguments both with trans women and with women who do believe that trans women should be treated as women.

* Content about how to pass as feminine is different than content for biological females who want to express themselves and celebrate their natural femininity.

* We want to have a community and so that means members should be able to get along and get to know each other. We want to share what's going on in our lives and experiences we've had in the past. Trans women do not have the same set of shared female experiences that enable us to bond easier with unknown women.

>What is the thing that you enjoy the most about your relationships that comes from your lifestyle 
>what is the thing from your relationships in this style that aggravates you the most.

It’s not a lifestyle I am just being myself. I never had to unlearn bad ideas to adopt RP ones; I naturally am a traditionally feminine woman who is attracted to masculine men and thrives in a traditional dynamic.

The thing that I most enjoy about my relationship is that I am with someone who understands me and loves me completely. If you were looking for something more unique to RPWs, I’d say that I enjoy the perks of being in the traditionally female role - things paid for me, doors opened, etc.  Nothing aggravates me about my relationship or my dynamic. I wouldn’t choose to do something that wasn’t fulfilling for me.

"""We"" in my last comment actually referred to RPWives not the FNF community. That post was originally submitted to the old sub and had far more than 23 upvotes but when we left the TRP network we (the mods) deleted all of our posts from that sub. I've since resubmitted a lot of what I wrote back then. People on the subreddit link the post and use the term in conversations weekly. It is not a term that I came up with, another mod coined it years ago and we've all been fleshing out ideas since then. I just wrote up a summary for new girls, which is why it used to be called RPW 101. While my personal opinion is in the post it is a summary of one of the basic ideas that the subreddit is founded on. Women who join RPW are introduced to the subject and everyone who chooses to stay embraces the idea. We have a set of concepts, terms, and theories that we agree is the definition of RPW. Hashing out and developing what RPW means is also part of participating on the subreddit. Women write posts and comments about their experiences and thought processes, we talk in the IRC, the main people involved in creating content have known each other for years. I'm not sure why you don't seem to think that I or anyone else who has been with RPW for as long as I have/longer doesn't know what we think. ",2,muacjdiscussion
"There's a difference between traditional relationship dynamics and sexual dominance and submission. And I do think it's different in terms of human nature, we believe in [psychological femininity](https://np.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/comments/4f9pjl/psychological_femininity/) and often use the analogy ""Captain and First Mate"" to describe how most RPW relationships run. 

Yes FNF launched on Wednesday, it is young and growing so quickly! A lot of the women who are on FNF are from /r/RedPillWives so I know what those women think because I've been speaking to them anywhere from 1 month to 3 years, both on reddit and on IRC. And we've discussed how we define femininity. 

>How do you know what the majority of women in r/femininenotfeminist think about ""traditional Western"" vs ""traditional Protestant"" femininity?

They don't have to think about it in those terms to have a definition of femininity that is in line with the Traditional Western version. Although many women do use the phrase ""Traditional Western"" when describing their values. I'm actually working on some OC now that explores different definitions of femininity within the US over time and how the definitions affected the culture (and vice versa). 

>I did read the discussion threads, and I don't recall that being discussed, so I'm not sure where you get your expertise about the dominant views of the community. 

In addition to what I said above, many women submitted a survey that gave additional insight into their beliefs on femininity. Also it is possible to look at the words people use when talking about femininity or things related to femininity and infer which definition people will align with.

"* We are not from redpillwomen we are /r/RedPillWives a completely different community. The OP did not actually check to see where we were from and has not updated her post. RPWives is not related to bdsm or sexual kinks and lifestyles. [This wiki page](https://np.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/wiki/about) gives an overview of what we are about. Traditional dynamics is not the same thing as sub/dom. We are interested in harmonious relationships based on male and female nature, not getting off from role play. 

* Our definition of feminine is the traditional Western definition which is not the same thing as the modern conservative Protestant definition of femininity. The latter equates femininity with moral goodness, being quiet, dainty, non sexual, and similar things. While some users may personally believe this is a good definition it is not the official position of the subreddit nor is it what the majority of the community believes. 

>It is possible to be feminine and a feminist. 

Agreed, and it is also possible to be feminine and *not* feminist which is what our new subreddit is about. 

>Women who describe themselves as ""feminine"" should be comfortable in the ""mainstream"" beauty and fashion subreddits. 

Women who are not feminist do not feel comfortable in subreddits where it is normal for users to insult conservatives, mock those who hold traditional values, rant about the President, and make sweeping claims about the type of people they imagine hold right wing opinions. Several women contacted me after they were insulted, argued with, and harassed by women in this sub and /r/BeautyGuruChat which led to the creation of /r/FeminineNotFeminist. 

> They should feel pushed to weird Red Pill recruiting subs. Some of the mods on there, especially u/Camille11325 [+7], are obviously trying to groom more mainstream women for the Red Pill Women subculture.

RPW is not a movement and we are not trying to ""groom"" anyone. We literally only want people who already agree with us. That is why we repeatedly use the phrase ""like minded women"" and it is why we have rules preventing the sub from turning into a debate sub. We don't want to spend time on the subs defending the ideas of sub or convincing anyone of what we believe and why. We are very clear about what we're about and what is expected if you are a member, and no one is forced to be there or participate if they disagree. 

Some of us who like to debate may go over to /r/PurplePillDebate and argue or try to convince people about things. But that is *not* the purpose of RPW or FNF and it has no place on either subreddits.

" In general men seem to prefer BMIs between 18 and 22. The fat to muscle ratio and the way your fat is distributed are both important factors that could mean that you look good with a BMI over 22.  If you have a dramatic hourglass figure or are muscular you're going to weigh more than average women at your height. 

Waist-hip ratio is also key. If you have a BMI of 19 but a WHR of .73 you're not going to look as feminine as someone with a BMI of 24 and a WHR of .65. If your WHR is naturally higher shapewear and dressing to enhance curves would make you look more hourglass. Also cosmetic surgery is becoming more accessible and advanced every year!

There are two sides of RPW - the descriptive and the prescriptive. On the descriptive side we look at: male and female nature in the abstract, the mindsets and behaviours of men and women throughout history & today, the sexual marketplace, the way that the culture is changing surrounding women’s roles & the significance of marriage, and we look at the consequences both positive and negative of feminism in the West. 

The prescriptive side of RPW is about applying the conclusions and theories based on your unique romantic situation. We stress personal responsibility and accountability, and focusing on what is directly under your control - your thoughts, actions, environment, etc. Since RPW is about female sexual strategy we stress efficient and effective choices that get you from your current status to the goal: a harmonious marriage. I go into great detail about Female Sexual Strategy [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/comments/5hz4md/female_sexual_strategy/). And [Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/wiki/about) is a wiki page I wrote that gives a summary of some of the descriptive and prescriptive concepts we focus on.  

Women come to RPW for different reasons. Some need to work on themselves and be less controlling, nagging, shrewish, or aggressive within their marriages. Others have husbands that they don’t get along with or are not attracted to but they want to save their marriage. There are a number of single women eager marry but unsure of how to obtain the relationship they want in the modern dating world. And of course there are women who live RPW ideas every day and want to help others and discuss culture and current events. We all believe in the three basic components of the prescriptive side of RPW: girl game, traditional dynamics, and good character. 


In terms of the anti feminism element of RPW, we disagree with the first premises of feminism and therefore the entire ideology. This doesn’t mean that individual users don’t believe in things like female education, voting rights, property rights, etc. We reject the idea that these positions are unique to feminism and also disagree with the feminist description of women’s oppression throughout US history. A number of us would also argue that “patriarchy” is synonymous with “civilization” and it is *not* the boogeyman that feminists make it out to be. I’ve been sharing [a chart that contrasts two different views of human nature](http://www.nku.edu/~gartigw/teaching_files/Weaver%20ch%2012%20Handout%20-%20Constrained%20versus%20Unconstrained%20Visions.pdf), and this really is at the heart of our disagreement with leftism as a whole.

"Sorry for the delay in my response, I had your comment and a few others open in a different window and didn’t realise until now!

>Feminism is the ""the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes."" Period.

This is a good summary of the underlying mission of all the various waves and subsections of feminist thought. It is not the totality of what it means to be a feminist however because there are beliefs that you have to hold in order to agree with the succinct statement that you gave. For example you have to agree that there is a such thing as “women’s rights”, you have to agree with the concept of changing laws to advance the socio-cultural status of women, you have to believe in the idea of equality of the sexes, you’d have to believe that the sexes are currently unequal and that historically women were oppressed. One of the most fundamental things that you also have to have in order to be a feminist is an “unconstrained vision” of humanity. [This chart explains the difference between constrained and unconstrained visions.](http://www.nku.edu/~gartigw/teaching_files/Weaver%20ch%2012%20Handout%20-%20Constrained%20versus%20Unconstrained%20Visions.pdf)  One small statement has so much behind it!

>The definition itself does not prove a ""monopoly"" but any person striving for equality between humans is therefore a ""feminist.""

Your definition of feminism is not the same thing as “equal application of the law for both genders”. A feminist could believe in what I said, and those who are against feminism can also support this idea. I know for a fact that I have a different idea of what “equal application” means, and we’d also disagree about what “the law” should be. Notice that my statement talks about equality in terms of the system, not equality of people. I believe that US citizens should receive just treatment since our tax dollars fund the legal system. Anyone can hold this belief without also having feminist values. This is what I mean when I say that feminism does not have a monopoly on the idea of fair treatment under the law. 

I agree that any person striving for equality is in the leftist camp and likely a feminist, even if they don’t use that label. I disagree that wanting a fair justice system = striving for equality because you be unequal economically, culturally, socially, politically, and in all other spheres, but still get the same treatment in court or when dealing with any other arm of the government. Hierarchy, struggle, and competition are all part of nature, and part of human nature. The genders are different and therefore not equal. We have different strengths, weaknesses, tendencies, and shared experiences - and I think this is awesome! I don’t believe that any one group is inherently better than anyone else, but that doesn’t mean I think everyone is *the same*. 

>To me, and many, many people, to not consider yourself a feminist...is backwards or just plain confusing.

I understand why you all feel this way. Alternative systems of thought are not really taught in school or easily accessible. Although I often use the term anti feminist as a quick way to describe some of my beliefs, those of us who oppose feminism don’t just have an ideological system that rejects feminism. My values are not just an inversion of feminist values. As an analogy: being atheist doesn’t mean that the only thing you believe is “not God” and it doesn't mean that you celebrate things Christians consider evil like robbery, murder, etc . You could have any number of opinions on the nature of reality, the meaning of life (or lack of meaning), morality, etc. You could use other labels in addition such as “materialist” but that requires more explanation and everyone has an idea of what “atheist” means. 

I personally have one foot in the traditional Catholic camp and one foot in the Objectivist camp. I think both are well thought out, sound theories that fully explain everything. Objectivism of course requires that there is no God, and I do not think it is possible to disprove the existence of God so I do not reject traditional Catholic ideas (think Aristotle, Aquinas, Augustine). Both are full schools of thought with hundreds of thousands of words written by brilliant minds. 

Moving away from the philosophical/large scale aspect of things, on the everyday level things are often presented as a binary between the feminist position and a conservative, Protestant position. E.g. “sex negative” vs. “sex positive” leaves out a whole range of opinions one can have on sex. Similarly I often see people act like you can either support feminism and therefore want women in the workforce or oppose feminism and therefore want *all* women to be homemakers. Another example: you can either support feminism and women’s right to vote or you oppose feminism and hate women having political opinions. What if you disagree with the current election process entirely? What if you have ideas about alternate ways that people can express their political positions without voting? What if you want restrictions on voting based on something other than merely being 18 years old? These false dichotomies limit people’s ability to explore other ways of looking at the world.   

> It is also completely possible, therefore, to be a feminist that disagrees with many leanings the movement may entail without labeling yourself ""anti-feminist.""

I agree with this, it just doesn’t apply to me! It does apply to some women who are active in RPWives and FNF even if by definition being a feminist and RP are mutually exclusive.

I have no idea if you've even ready my comment or not but I just wanted to let you know that I edited it to add an additional thought that I had. Didn't want you to miss it!,1,muacjdiscussion
"Hey sorry I’m just responding to you now, I’ve had so many tabs and windows open today some messages slipped through the cracks! 

>What made you feel existing subs weren't doing it for you - is it because you want to be able to digress into discussions of what 'feminine' is? 

I’ve been reading the various makeup subs on reddit for years, they have consistently great content, interesting questions, and entertaining discussion. The few times I’ve participated on posts that specifically asked for a range of opinions, I received hostile comments, downvotes, and insulting PMs. I specifically don’t share my opinion much on main reddit subs to avoid these situations because I generally seek to avoid conflict. But when there is an interesting question that asks to hear all sides, I thought I could try it out. I decided to turn FNF into a community for beauty because other women reached out to me and asked me to. They received the same treatment, and some had it even worse. I’ve seen screenshots of harassment on FB by members of muacjdiscussion, towards one of the other FNF mods. 

The benefits of this new sub are:

* Not having to read circlejerks against Trump, conservatives, women with traditional values, women who want to be attractive specifically for men, etc. 

* Not having to apologise for disagreeing, go out of our way to not offend someone, over explain, or hold back. 

* Not having to read posts and comment sections that we disagree with but know we can’t actually participate in successfully. 

* The ability to discuss the problems and situations that we have that are unique to being a woman who is traditional, anti feminist and/or conservative. 

* The ability to celebrate traditional Western ideas of femininity and beauty without being insulted, mocked, harrassed, or looked down on.

I could go on!

>Would you welcome trans women, for example, if they were traditional in their look? 

I wrote in another comment why we don’t allow trans women, the main reason is because it would disrupt the cohesion of the community. Here are the points I brought up:

>Women who otherwise value honest constructive criticism and feedback feel compelled to praise trans women for average or even subpar makeup looks, hairstyles, fashion choices, etc.

>Women who believe that trans women are not actually women would get into arguments both with trans women and with women who do believe that trans women should be treated as women.

>Content about how to pass as feminine is different than content for biological females who want to express themselves and celebrate their natural femininity.

>We want to have a community and so that means members should be able to get along and get to know each other. We want to share what's going on in our lives and experiences we've had in the past. Trans women do not have the same set of shared female experiences that enable us to bond easier with unknown women.

Now nothing is stopping a conservative trans woman who passes from being an active member of the community - we’d never know. But I think enforcing a female space is important. There are many communities on reddit for trans women already. 

>Radical feminists (I am not one) believe femininity is a performance - in The Female Eunuch, Greer wrote about how drag queens were more 'feminine' than cis women could ever be, because they can take all these symbols of femininity and create this new persona.

This is interesting and definitely something I’d love to have a larger discussion about both on muacjdiscussion and RPWives and FNF. I disagree completely but I would love to really dive into this idea with people from all sides of the subject! I believe that gender and biology are inseparable and that femininity itself is not inherently a performance, although drag queens and trans women are certainly performing. They are not authentically feminine. I actually agree with the radfems on /r/GenderCritical on a lot of things regarding trans people, they may not be representative of all radfems though. 

To expand more on my position:

People communicate today largely through signals and symbols, references are so key in all interactions and media as well. In a lot of ways the symbol is more important than the reality. 

An example of this I am going to steal from a post from The Last Psychiatrist. Jay Z has a music video where he is singing about being authentic, from the streets, super real and hood, etc. But the actual images are him going to an Italian restaurant, eating spaghetti, playing cards with the mafia, etc. None of this is actually who Jay Z is but Italian = authentic in the minds of Americans. He communicated a truth about himself by showing a fiction. If he had a video of him in the streets, with guns, being in a black gang, that seems fake, even though it is real. Because aspects of black culture have similarly been reduced to a brand, and that symbol is not in line with the message he was trying to communicate during that song. He would have seemed like every other rapper and therefore unoriginal, not authentic, posing, etc.  

I’m saying all of this to say, that even though people can use symbols of Italian culture to signify authenticity, or symbols of Black culture to signify masculinity, neither “Italian” or “Black” are inherently based on performance. It is genetics that determines your ethnicity, just as genetics determine your gender. Building off of this, I believe that many women today use symbols of vintage, Post WWII America to signal femininity today in the same way that white men adopt hip hop culture to signal masculinity. Similarly drag queens and trans women take the modern symbols of femininity and use it to signal something they are not, to reveal a truth they believe about themselves. 

Hope that makes sense and thanks for reading :)

Edited thought of more!: I see a difference between choosing symbols to signal your values, personality, choices, etc. And choosing symbols to signal that you are trans. One is an expression of your innate characteristics in the manner that most people do today, the other is rejecting your innate characteristics and using symbols as if you were a different group. So it's two layers of performance. And it isn't performance to convey a reality (e.g. a conservative woman who longs for a return to normalcy gravitating towards vintage illustrations) but rather a performance that attempts to alter reality.

"From another comment that I left today:

>The term ""red pill"" was coined almost 10 years ago within the DE/reactionary/manosphere subsection of the internet. TRP was made a few years ago as a reddit forum to discuss the ideas that those websites and blogs focused on. It has since developed its own culture and theories and when we (the mod team of redpillwomen) decided that we didn't like what they were saying at all we left and all of the active women came with us to the new sub.

>We actually reserved the name ""Feminine Not Feminist"" during that time because we weren't sure what name we were going to go with. But we wanted to keep the acronym RPW because it is useful as both an noun and adjective and it would mean that we didn't have to change a lot of posts that we'd written haha plus we like the connection to the original manosphere. TRP did not create RP ideas and it is our belief that they have warped things and also have added in a lot of non RP stuff to their sub.

>You say you aren't anti women, yet you are pro fat shaming and do not believe that overweight women should ""waste "" time on makeup or looking attractive. 

Yes I think that cultural and social pressure are good motivators and when we normalise and celebrate being overweight and obese it damages these women’s lives.  It is unhealthy to be very overweight and fat acceptance and HAES proponents are in denial about this. Do I hate every individual fat person? Of course not. But I don’t like the messages of those movements or the mentality of the women who support them. I *love* women and want us all to look and feel our best! I believe that people have more control over their lives than we think and wish that everyone would value their health and appearance. In terms of being a “waste of time” I feel like it’s misplaced priorities. If an overweight woman wants to improve her looks, she should concentrate on losing weight first before spending tons of money on wardrobe or makeup. [This blog post](www.therulesrevisited.com/2011/09/feminine-beauty-is-highly-controllable.html) explains what I mean, it isn’t an “rp” blog post or anything it’s very objective and accessible (and cool I think!). 

>but if you are not anti women why so much of your sub revolves around ""hating sjw"" hating overweight women, hating x or y thing etc?

Niether RPW or FNF revolve around hating sjws or any other thing. RPW is primarily about relationships and FNF is about beauty. Our communities have different definitions of what it means to be feminine, and what female nature is. Since FNF just started I made a post about unpopular opinions, and there are posts that focus on culture because it is important that women know that they can actually speak their minds. 

There will always be posts about current events and culture on both communities, just as there are posts about current events and culture on muacjdiscussion or beautyguruchat. Both of these subs regularly discuss political issues and express disagreement towards conservative and right wing opinions. Both of these subs regularly insult and mock those who hold conservative and right wing opinions and make jokes at their expense. 

As FNF grows and develops we will have plenty of politically neutral conversations, I’m excited to see what culture we will develop. I made a survey for new members to share what they want from the sub and this weekend I’ll be posting the results and possibly making new rules based on the feedback. 

>To an outsider it seems like it bothers you guys more than necessary.

And from my perspective as an “outsider” to feminist groups I think a lot of things bother you all more than necessary haha! These differences stem from our different worldviews and values and that is fine. I don’t think that RPW  has a higher number of things that bother us in comparison to other groups, it’s just not the same things that bother feminists. 

>If someone is happy overweight, wouldn't that mean that more RP men would be available for you guys? Why spend the energy shaming others who are not your competition?

If by “RP men” you mean the men of the redpill subreddit please know that those guys are *not* who we want at all!! I did a survey not too long ago and I believe around 80% of the women were already married or in serious LTRs and only a few of the subscriber’s men even know what RP or the manosphere even is. 

Just because we discuss amongst ourselves our opinions on various things eg fat acceptance culture, doesn’t mean that we act on these things in real life and try to get people to change. We are all about accountability and agency and focus advice on what we as individuals can do. There is a difference between our personal opinions and what we think others should do. No one spends energy shaming others. Having a conversation with other women who agree with you is not shaming another person. The community is not for fat acceptance proponents, we are not speaking to them, we are not telling them how to live their lives. 

As far as competition goes, that isn’t relevant to my (and other’s) opinion that celebrating being overweight is unhealthy and ultimately damaging for women. Our position has nothing to do with sexual strategy. 

>How do you feel of fetishes like feederism? Women are considered to be the most beautiful as they grow larger and they are attractive to their subset of men. Yet, she'd be obese. Curious to hear what you think.

I think it’s gross but great that the internet and technology allows people to connect that have niche interests like this. Wouldn’t want anyone to not be allowed to do this, but I don’t have to personally approve or support it. I’m all for tolerance, just not forced acceptance. I am also all about freedom but actions have consequences. These women are leading an unhealthy lifestyle. It is their choice. Me disagreeing with their choice isn’t the same thing as me wanting their ability to choose to be taken away. This same mentality applies to a lot of other positions. Many feminists who read the sub don’t realise that we separate what we personally believe and choose from what we think that others should do. 

>Yet do you think that adopting the same name as Red Pill Wives is actually a validation of Red Pill culture? 

The term “red pill” is a signal to other likeminded people. They know what it means and know what they can expect. Anyone who is actually interested in the ideas will take the time to read our subreddit and see what we believe. They are able to distinguish between our community and the redpill sub. We absolutely agree with “red pill” ideas from the early years of the manosphere and we are not ashamed of the term red pill. People who disagree with us have a negative association with the term. We do not have this same negative association so it doesn’t bother us. We’re not interested in changing ourselves to appeal to groups that don’t want us to succeed. 

>I's like I can explain to you what feminism is to me but to you, just because it is called feminist you would have a preset idea.

Having an idea of what something is based on the label is fine. But refusing to listen to further explanations from people who actually know more about the subject is not. This is what I have experienced commenting today - people making up what I believe and then telling me that I am wrong when I disagree. Feminism and leftist ideology in general is actually a subject that I study a lot both the present iterations and its history. A lot of people assume that if you disagree with feminism it is because you just don’t understand it but that isn’t the case for the overwhelming majority of the members of RPW. 

If I make a claim about what *you* believe and you tell me that no, you don’t believe that, I would accept this as true! It doesn’t mean that I now agree with you, but I can form an argument that actually makes sense. As an example imagine if I told you that since you are a feminist, you support throwing gay people off of roofs. There are some feminists who support Islam, some Islamic people have thrown gay people off of roofs. Therefore you support throwing gay people off of roofs. This is how ridiculous some of the things that I’ve been reading here sound to me haha! 

>This one is more personal, but how did you get into this culture, we're you raised this way? 

My parents are both democrats and involved in the government. I grew up surrounded by politics and was always in rigorous programs in school that exposed us to a lot of ideas. I’ve always been passionate about philosophy and history, and have done extensive research both in school and in my free time on Western culture and civilisations. My worldview is mostly a combination of Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. In addition to reading, I acquired my perspective from my everyday experience. It just didn’t line up with the messages in the mainstream. This comment is so long already so if you are interested I could expand in my response. 

As far as how I found the DE-sphere it was basically religious blogs -> DE/reactionary -> RP male game (pick up) -> TRP subreddit -> redpillwomen subreddit -> became a mod -> made new, better RPW sub! 

>What do you feel is the most gratifying and the most frustrating thing about it?

Most gratifying: helping women who are struggling in their marriages, having a group of women to bounce ideas off of and theorise with and rant with, applying the ideas to my own life and seeing nothing but success. 

Most frustrating: wanting to have real discussions and debates with people but they resort to insults, fallacies, lies, or just yelling at me. Also another frustration is wanting to quote and reference so many things and link people to tons of blogs and posts but I know no one would ever read them lol

"We do align ourselves with red pill ideas, the ideas of the early manosphere. Not TRP, not redpillwomen, not random blogs that also use the name redpill. We are very clear on our subreddit what we do and don't support. The term is useful to signal to other likeminded people where we stand. RPWives isn't a movement or interested in converting anyone so other people being offended by our name, its connotations, or our positions isn't relevant to how we manage our community. 

I never claimed that I don't agree with RP ideas, I stated multiple times in multiple comments that we disagree with TRP the subreddit. You and others believe that The Donald sub is a space for ""bigoted rhetoric"" but I and many others disagree. This is fine. Many people who are on the donald sub describe themselves as liberal, democrats, centrist, or moderate. There are a wide variety of people over there, many had never even heard the term ""alt right"" until Hillary's campaign started using it. 

I understand why people would assume things about the subreddit but a real investigation on the official positions of RPWives would reveal that a lot of the claims made here are unfounded. There is plenty that you guys disagree with legitimately based on your ideological and moral systems. And that is fine. But I'd rather someone disagree with me for real reasons not invented ones.

"""their bodies belong to a man they haven't met."" That was your takeaway? I'm very surprised that this is how you understood her point because that is not something that any of us believe. You're framing it in a way that misses the actual point that we are making.

Considering the possible consequences to your actions doesn't remove your agency. Wanting to appeal to someone you find appealing isn't a bad thing. Being intentional in your actions based on your values and priorities minimizes the risk of unhappiness. 

>A lot of the comments were about the ""ladylike"" aspect though, it is prevalent throughout the sub. 

Yes some users discussed how feminine tattoos are but the degree of femininity is separate from the ""official RPW position on what one should do"". And again that position would be consider your lifestyle and goals and make the most optimal choice. /u/phantomdream09 even made a distinction between the official position and her *personal* opinion. 

>Their self-worth is entangled with the desires, affirmations, and the choices of her husband. 

Being affected by the desires, affirmations, and choices of your husband is not the same thing has having an unstable sense of self, low self esteem, or compromised identity. Wanting to do things that both of you agree with and will be pleased by is not weakness. Getting joy from bringing him joy is not terrible. And it doesn't mean that we *only* get joy from bringing the men in our lives joy. It doesn't mean that we never disagree or voice our  opinions. It doesn't mean we revolve our entire lives around our relationship. 

RPW is a space to discuss specific subjects, it doesn't mean that we don't have other interests and priorities. And in the comments and more off topic posts people do share these things. 

>They are keeping themselves 'pure' because it's what her husband would want. 

It is absolutely not about *purity* I don't know why people here keep bringing that up. A lot of men in the US think that a tattoo is a sign of: sluttiness, risk taking, low FTO, or just bad character in general. It is associated with prisons, gangs, and the military. Several religions oppose tattoos and even those who shed their religious beliefs when they get older still have a bias against tattoos. 

If you are a woman interested in dating and marrying a man, knowing how men think is an important part of getting to your goal. You can't ignore that there are men who don't like tattoos, and if you're on the fence but then decide not to get one because of this, it's a prudent decision. It's no more about ""purity"" than choosing not to get a face tattoo so that you are employable is about ""purity"". 

>But even in your writing, it is very negative. 

It is negative in my comment because I personally don't like tattoos yes but there is a difference between my personal opinion and the advice that one would give on RPW. 

>Your husband seems to have the final say, making sure he's happy is the important thing for you. 

No woman has to give their husband the final say on this or any decision. Our community is a space for likeminded women who do value their man's opinion enough that they would defer if he strongly objected to them getting a tattoo. The happiness of the men in our lives is definitely important to us, and those men value our happiness as well. I really don't see what is wrong with advising  a woman to consider her man's opinion on this matter. It could avoid a lot of  conflict, resentment, and/or loss of attraction.

>To have harmony, he must be happy, with the implication of if he's happy, you're happy.

To have harmony *both* must be happy. And making our men happy pleases us just as making us happy pleases them.

"* People assuming that we are from redpillwomen and agree with TRP when as I just explained that is not the case. 

* Comments claiming that we don't believe women should have choices or rights, that we hate women, that we support abuse, and other false statements about our beliefs. 

* There was a thread that made it seem like we were concerned with female ""purity"" and virginity when that isn't true. 

* There are comments that equate the members of both communities with white nationalists and nazis when that also isn't true. 

People are going to disagree with us and that is fine, but a lot of the shock and anger that I see isn't even based on what we actually believe.

I've spent 8 years in the DE/reactionary/manosphere section of the internet and a few years discussing and debating these things on reddit. Nothing that is being said here is shocking, angering, upsetting, etc. to me or to other members of RPWives who are reading. Your characterisation of me is not based on anything that I've said. I've been polite and informative in my comments here and while I have spoken about people misrepresenting us, the issue is with the inaccuracy and dishonesty.

That's not the case it's just one of many opinions I have and nothing more. 

For #2 I've seen plenty of outrage at women and companies who are inspired by other cultures. People see cultural appropriation in everything it seems. If someone is mocking another group or disrespecting them in some way that is different than incorporating aspects of that culture into a look/product. I have an issue with the former and not the latter.

I have no interest in changing anyone's beliefs. 

I've been reading muacjdiscussion for ages and often enjoy the topics. A few times when I have commented in disagreement with the majority of the subreddit I was not well received. Other women experienced this as well and reached out to me and we made a new subreddit to avoid this issue. Did you not think that we would see this post? Or that we wouldn't want to share our thoughts? The fact that so many women are quick to assume the worst about us after doing very little research about who we are and what we believe is one of the reasons why we made our own space.

"The term ""red pill"" was coined almost 10 years ago within the DE/reactionary/manosphere subsection of the internet. TRP was made a few years ago as a reddit forum to discuss the ideas that those websites and blogs focused on. It has since developed its own culture and theories and when we (the mod team of redpillwomen) decided that we didn't like what they were saying at all we left and all of the active women came with us to the new sub.

We actually reserved the name ""Feminine Not Feminist"" during that time because we weren't sure what name we were going to go with. But we wanted to keep the acronym RPW because it is useful as both an noun and adjective and it would mean that we didn't have to change a lot of posts that we'd written haha plus we like the connection to the original manosphere. TRP did not create RP ideas and it is our belief that they have warped things and also have added in a lot of non RP stuff to their sub. 

Our community has also developed new ideas and theories, which you can see in the Essential Posts section of the wiki. There is also a wiki page called ""All About RPW"" that gives a short overview of the sub's beliefs and purpose.

I don't think it's excessive if beauty things are a hobby/pasttime for you and it's not actually something I am trying to force other women to do. It's just an unpopular opinion that I have that is beauty related. The more time you put into yourself, the better you'll look and feel. 

Also another reason why I shared it is because women who *do* invest their time into their appearance are looked down on especially by other women. Your comment about it being ""excessive"" and ""having better things to do"" is a great example. Do women who prioritise their looks not have anything better to do? What if we just have different schedules, different ways of spending our time? What if we *make* time to take care of ourselves how we want?

Our rejection of feminism comes from philosophical and ideological differences. We also dislike a lot of the consequences that it has had on America. Our focus is on harmonious relationships that have traditional dynamics because we believe in inherent male and female nature. If you actually looked at the sub what we believe is clearly explained, each individual's reasons for opposing any or all aspects of feminism are out there in the open. Feminism doesn't have a monopoly on the idea of equal application of the law to both genders and that is *not* the entirety of what feminism is about. 

It's just really disappointing that you would direct users to a sub that has nothing to do with FNF and in fact it is a sub that I dislike and does *not* represent me or the majority of the women who have joined! RPWives is linked all over FNF and it's even in the sidebar. 

I was contacted by many women after this sub and beautyguruchat got very political and women with conservative opinions were being downvoted, insulted, yelled at, argued with, and even harassed in PM. One user even received harassment on her facebook account from the fb group of women from reddit (pretty sure it's affiliated with this sub).

"My own thoughts on the questions:

* Yes I definitely think that social media and the internet enhances the sense of female competition. I feel like before social media you really only were directly competing with the people in your social circle, neighborhood, church, local groups, family, etc. (both for status and in the SMP) but now you have all of those groups + people you normally would have lost touch with + social media influencers + celebrities + other women who you never would have met/heard of if it weren't for the internet. Basically the more women you are exposed to, the more pressure many feel to measure up or surpass everyone else.

* I think that the normalisation of photo editing apps gives guys an unrealistic idea of what women in general look like. I don't have a problem with photo editing, in fact I'd love for us to exchange tips, just noticing the trend. Also Wayne Goss recently posted a video about how someone's skin can look remarkably different with the right lighting and filters. Since most people don't realise that this is happening, I think that it gives women unrealistic expectations of what products can do to improve appearance. 

* I think the bar will be set way higher when it comes to appearance since plastic surgery, body sculpting, laser treatments, and more are becoming the norm. I'm really excited about the technological innovations happening in the beauty world and think it's great that we can alter our appearance so that we can look exactly how we want.

"You're writing to me like I don't understand fashion or art when that isn't the case. Disagreeing with your opinion =/= not having a clue and needing to be lectured to. I focused my initial comment to you in an attempt to cut through the fluff that is present in most of your comments within this thread, you constantly bring up so much stuff so I made a direct argument to contradict your claims. You are framing this discussion in a way that conceals the real point of the debate. I am more than happy to discuss the subject with you but please refrain from condescending lectures in the future. 

>That's like saying of a painting or photograph ""if someone has to know the full back story behind a picture for it to have any significance, then it is not an iconic image."" Plenty of iconic images are considered to be so not because of their inherent composition, or the color palette, but because of the moment they captured, and the backstory behind it.

If the backstory is **literally** the only thing that gives an image or look any value, then yes, I would argue that it is not deserving of the praise and status. Most things that have compelling backstories *also* have other redeeming aspects. In my opinion, Michelle's fashion choices are not interesting enough *on their own* to merit additional interest. The only reason anyone even knows of the backstory behind her looks is because of the extensive PR campaign that she ran throughout Barack's presidency. If she were a regular woman with zero status, I am not sure that anyone would be curious about why she chose any particular piece. **My argument is that her outfits are objectively normal and she is only considered an icon because of media spin.**

>The pure aesthetic value of something is only one measurement of the value it has. 

Yep but it is an important component when it comes to deciding who is and isn’t a fashion icon. It cannot be ignored, and it is one of the most important factors. 

> But I also understand the backstory of the fashion she's wearing - it's not something I can turn off. It's not something that the people she's communicating to with her clothes can turn off, either; and there's value in that. Even if a visiting head of state doesn't know the name of a designer whose dress she's wearing, they will understand the shared cultural aesthetic the dress speaks to. They will know that the First Lady has made an effort to make them feel welcome. There is value in that.

You may find this valuable but I disagree that this makes her a fashion icon. As I said before Michelle Obama is a brand. She has done an excellent job presenting a cohesive image and educating others on her brand philosophy. You buy into her brand and that’s fine, but it’s not an objective fact that Michelle should be regarded as a fashion icon because of the reasons that she claims. That is what is being questioned and you’re just repeating the very things that are up for debate. 

While context is certainly part of the discussion when it comes to how to evaluate her wardrobe decisions, Michelle and her team emphasize this aspect and therefore others accept the idea that she is great because of the larger significance. Do you understand that we are challenging this very idea?


>I think it's perfectly reasonable for people in the fashion industry to understand the backstory and language of their own industry and to appreciate when someone with as much visibility and influence as the First Lady does as well. 

You seem to assume that the only reason that someone would disagree with Michelle’s status as a fashion icon is because they don’t understand. Being able to identify references and fully know the intentions behind a look is doesn’t automatically guarantee that you will like something. No one was arguing that Michelle isn’t considered a fashion icon by people today, the questions are: Does she *deserve* the label? and How many women on FNF would agree that she deserves the label? 

You never actually responded to my main point so I don’t have much to add. If you do respond to this comment please stay on topic!

"Michelle branded herself as a fashion icon and made use of multiple media outlets to cement this image in the minds of others. She had extensive PR campaigns designed to convince others of her status and there are currently numerous articles on various websites and in magazines praising Michelle and comparing her to Melania. That certainly is not an accident or just a coincidence. 

While Michelle was thoughtful about what she wore and why, if she were not the First Lady she would never have been seen as an icon. Intention alone does not determine how iconic your looks are. The actual execution of the outfits has to be aesthetically pleasing in some way - you can be bold and daring without being off putting and ugly. If a random person who had no knowledge of who Michelle was saw a collection of photos, I don't believe that they would consider her looks as remarkably different from other upper middle class and upper class black women. 

Also to speak a bit more about her wardrobe choices: if someone needs to know the full backstory behind every piece that you chose in order for your outfit to have any significance, then you are not an icon. If Michelle wore the exact same clothes but they just happened to be off the rack from a department store does your assessment of her change?",3,FeminineNotFeminist

"Here are some of mine!

* I am pro fat shaming. Without social pressure large people are not going to be incentivised to change for the better. I don't even think that fashionable clothing should be made in plus sizes. If you aren't a ""large"" or below you shouldn't be wearing things like crop tops, short shorts, or see through clothing anyways.

* Every woman should spend at least 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening on appearance and self care in addition to regularly working out and eating an appropriate amount to maintain a trim figure.

* Cultural appropriation does *not* happen as often as people like to complain about today. People can be inspired by other cultures and want to include influences and references to other cultures with their look. Diversity is the norm today, people are exposed to all sorts of aesthetics and if they want to incorporate them into a product or look that isn't automatically evil! The sensitivity of SJWs is causing them to put every ethnic group in a box so that black people can only do X and white people can only do Y. 

* **I wear makeup to look more attractive.** It is not self expression, it is not art. I wear it to look **sexually appealing** to my man and to look **socially acceptable** to everyone else. EVERYONE LOOKS BETTER WITH MAKEUP ON as long as it's applied correctly of course. I enjoy applying makeup, it's fun, it's a hobby.

Just look at how many women who oppose abortion were treated as enemies during the Women's March.

Exactly! And when you spend so much time focusing on how to be more like men, you are NOT developing the feminine skills that would be very useful in a marriage. And that only makes it more likely that your marriage will fail and then you WILL need all those male skills you honed.

"Focusing on one aspect of an issue isn't the same as being naive or ignoring nuance. The author has hundreds of blog posts where she explores everything related to RP, antifeminism, relationships, and culture. She doesn't need to have every post bring up every possible argument and counter argument. She just wanted to zoom in on a specific thought that interested her. You've repeatedly characterised her and our community as oblivious and shallow and this is your first and only official warning to stop.

I viewed this post more as a rumination on a modern issue and not a specific, actionable plan that everyone should act on immediately. And the very fact that some of the ideas can't be easily implemented is part of the discussion. Feminism pushed for women to join the male workforce, which had a huge impact on the economy and on the lifestyles people expected now that they had more money coming in. It is actually entirely possible to live on one income BUT you won't have the same lifestyle as your peers. That being said, on RPW we aren't anti women having jobs. There is a difference between bringing in money and being a career woman. 

This post is relevant because it looks at one of the ways that the system perpetuates itself. Even women who prefer more traditional roles and/or dynamics encourage their daughters and peers to have the attitudes and skills that are necessary to advance along the feminist path. The time that women spend focusing on being a great student and employee could be used to develop other skills. So many women are unprepared to be wives and mothers. And so many women don't think about other possibilities that would allow them to have money while also being available for their men. 

On the individual level it is 100% possible that parents who are aware of how bad feminism is could refuse to indoctrinate their children and encourage them to seek out a more fulfilling path. Who cares if these ideas can't be implemented simultaneously and en masse? That isn't a very good way to judge an idea or a blog post. ",4,RedPillWives
Yes exactly!,1,RedPillWives
"It's not naive it's examining the issue and asking us to reconsider ideas that are taken for granted in mainstream society. Looking at how things are vs. how things used to be vs. how things could be is important. When you look at what *actually* makes the majority of women happy, and what *actually* makes the majority of men happy it is clear that the feminist narrative is wrong. The values we instill in people today push them along paths that aren't fulfilling. And the effects aren't just on the individual level, our entire economy and culture has shifted to the point for many people it is near impossible to turn things around and adhere to a more traditional lifestyle. The distance between what people innately want to do and what we are conditioned to want to do is something worth discussing. ",7,RedPillWives
"I don't think that this article or anyone on the sub advocates that women don't do anything to develop themselves. I'm not sure if you're aware of the connotations that ""independence"" has when feminists advocate for it. Should women be able to pay all of their bills? Absolutely. But there is a question of priorities and values, and mindset. The lifestyle that is encouraged in the mainstream causes women to not even have many of the skills necessary for a successful marriage. 

You worry about women who ""put all their eggs in one basket"" but so many women are running away from any sort of risk when it comes to relationships. And this only leads to more unhappiness. Vulnerability is essential, trust is essential. And if a woman develops wife skills she will a) be less likely to have her man leave him and b) be positioned to remarry in a way that women who solely focused on work skills aren't.

"You can have a steady income and even be financially independent without subscribing to the rest of feminist ideas and values. I don't think the two go hand in hand and I felt that the article does a good job pointing out a lot of the ways that women are conditioned to accept 100% of feminist and BP worldview instead of picking out the truths and ignoring the rest.

Another example of this would be the idea that believing that women should receive education or the right to vote automatically makes you a feminist. It is entirely possible to believe in both without being a feminist, there are hundreds if not thousands of ideologies and political positions. Feminism does not have a monopoly on the idea of equal application of the law to both genders, just like it doesn't have a monopoly on the idea of women being able to financially support themselves. 

But we should also question what it means to be independent, and what values and skills we are passing on to our daughters and encouraging in our peers. Aren't we hurting women when we act like the only alternative to being financially vulnerable is being a career focused woman who doesn't value marriage or men? Aren't we hurting women when being financially vulnerable and/or dependent on someone else is looked down upon? That is certainly a perspective that can be scrutinized. ",7,RedPillWives

I agree with this completely! Personally I think that traditional dynamics and RPW style relationships are the most rewarding for 99% of people. But the question itself said that he was a feminist and wanted a feminist, so I was giving an answer based on that hypothetical. If a man thinks he wants equality and no traditional dynamics but you try to have an RPW-esque relationship that isn't RPW, since not only are you not doing what he wants you are trying to change him and will probably cause friction. If he wants equality and no traditional dynamics and you go along with it, it's also not RPW. Hopefully that makes sense!  

In the real world you and I are on the same page - even if a man thinks he wants a feminist approved relationship he would be much happier with what we advocate here and applying RPW methods and concepts to your relationship would be the best way to keep him. But that involves him changing his mind about what he wants in a relationship!",2,RedPillWives

">You don't think someone could advocate for feminism but in their personal life prefer traditional male-led dynamics? Honestly this is probably the majority of women that I meet. They only think about feminism in the grande scheme, but they go out of their way to honor, respect, and support their BFs/husbands. Most people don't break down and analyze feminism as deeply as we do here.

Sure people can do that, they just aren't RPWs. You don't have to analyze feminism or politics in depth to be an RPW, plenty of conservative/right wing women don't look at things too deeply but they are anti feminist and have RP relationships (even w/o knowing of the concept). RPW is inherently anti feminist, it is part of the definition of what it means to be RP. 

>Additionally, I have a very hard time believing Obama wouldn't be considered a good man. Disagree with his politics all you like, but he is a well spoken, high achieving man who held the highest office. Regardless of what he calls himself, he's a good catch! He is attractive, a good provider, and a powerful man.

Plenty of people would consider him a catch but most non liberals won't because his worldview, values, and actions are all factored into how we assess a man. You can't just handwave this by saying ""disagree with his politics all you like"" because his politics are integral to how he attained any sort of status. 

Everything you said in this comment is entirely up to debate. Is he well spoken? He has a teleprompter and speech writers, and he regularly messes up both with and without those aids. And since when is ""well spoken"" more important than ""shares the same outlook I do about the world"" when judging men? Is he high achieving? He has certainly done things, but if you disagree with what he has done then the number of achievements is actually a bad thing! The fact that a person achieves something doesn't erase the weight of what it is that they achieved. 

Sure he was president but he doesn't have the best reputation, and the rank alone doesn't determine if a man is good or not.  To me he is not attractive, I'm not sure where you are getting that he is a good provider, and his reputation isn't one of a powerful man - not just with other countries but within his own marriage. I just completely disagree that he is a good catch, but again there are liberal women who would love to date him. But their relationship would not be RP!

Not one masculine man that I've met has been a feminist. This was true throughout school, and it's true now that my social circle is mostly people 30 - 60 years old.

"> It just makes me think that the way you view these relationships has an effect on the outcome

Love this!

>if you still see the man as a friend and can't admit to dating him...it's going to stay that way.

I think a lot of women do this to protect themselves emotionally because they know that this man isn't going to commit to them, even if they really want it and are hoping he does. Refusing to call him a hookup or some other obvious short term label makes them feel more secure. But they legitimately can't say he's a boyfriend because there is no exclusivity or official relationship. And they don't want to say ""dating"" or ""seeing each other"" or some other thing because even if they want it, they know that there isn't a future there.

"Yes his relationship with his wife is great! I'm trying to put to words some thoughts that I'm having about women with high dominance thresholds. Our compassion for the hypermasculine is definitely not the norm, and I am not sure if this is strictly an LH thing or if HH women feel the same way.

Greater betas and lesser alphas are rewarded the most in civilisations. And with feminism poisoning everyone against real men it only further alienates the hypermasculine. Why would they feel any allegiance to official laws and processes?

"I tell M when I need time for myself and I use those exact words. It helps to be specific because if you don't communicate that you want space for a period of time the other person may want to talk to you, hang out, do some activity and then when you decline they feel unwanted. It also can make you want to retreat even further because you feel like this person is intruding. It's all about how you say it, personally I just say ""M I need to reset/recharge so I'll be in the bedroom/in the gym/on the couch/taking a walk"". If I just said ""I'll be on the couch"" he may come over in a few minutes to try to talk to me; this exact scenario actually happened before and I was unreasonably frustrated by him because I didn't make it clear what I needed at the time. He knows me more than anyone but he isn't a mind reader! Perhaps this is an intro/extro thing. My default is wanting to be with others and wanting human interaction. So when I want to be alone it's a distinct feeling and I have to alter my usual actions in order to have that alone time. 

That being said I feel like she used examples of ""not pleasing"" instead of examples of ""giving"". I talk about this more in my comment, really interested in hearing your thoughts on my takeaways. I think that a big distinction in the two mentalities is that pleasing ultimately is rooted in fear, whereas giving comes from confidence and security. Pleasing is about avoiding negative consequences, and giving is about creating positive consequences. Pleasing is more passive in a way since the feelings of others take precedence. In contrast giving requires a sense of agency - you have to actively decide when and how to use your resources and your feelings are a top priority. 

I agree with your criticisms of her sex example and I'm not sure why she didn't present better evidence for her points. 
She really missed some opportunities to explore the subject!",2,RedPillWives
"While not perfect, this blog post makes a lot of great points about what is truly motivating women when they do things for others. Many of us are compelled to be generous, kind, forgiving, accommodating, flexible, cooperative, etc. These natural instincts are great but the way we act on them is important. Doing something helpful so that another person doesn't stop liking you is something done by a woman with nothing else to offer. If you have value to others (whether it is your looks, personality, skills, insight, or a combination) you should be more confident and not stoop to people pleasing. 

Bending over backwards and/or being a doormat for your man is **not** the same thing as yielding to his leadership or being his soft place to land. One example that she gives of pleasing really illustrates this point. If you have plans with a friend and your man asks if you want to do X tonight, you can say ""well Susan and I were going to do Y, can we do X later?"" if you truly want to do Y. If he is asking what you want to do, be honest, don't just say what you think he wants to hear because you're afraid he'll leave you. 

Now there were also some parts that I didn't like. She defines ""giving"" at the beginning but then her examples include instances of a woman simply not pleasing. Giving isn't the same as not pleasing, it's its own thing. It is acting from a place of (feminine) power and bringing joy to others by sharing your value. Is it better to have no sex than have bad sex? Yes; but it's even better to have great sex, and that would be the example of giving. Is it better to opt out of things than run yourself down? Absolutely; but ""giving"" would be participating and being awesome at whatever the activity is. 

You don't have to give 24/7 or indiscriminately but at least to me giving is always the addition of a positive element into any situation. Let me know what you thought!",3,RedPillWives

"M and I just started watching Narcos (no spoilers!) and I've been thinking about how so many hypermasculine men don't have many legitimate avenues in civilized societies. 

Those that are born in certain classes can go into politics, business, and other fields that allow them to use their strengths. Those who have athletic talent can go into sports. And then of course there are the armed forces and high risk blue collar jobs. But what about the men who have aggression, ambition, leadership skills, a strategic mind, DT traits, etc but can't do any of those things? It isn't surprising at all that they'd form gangs, mafias, and other similar organisations and try to run the local neighborhoods. These men are wired to be tribal leaders and society is organised in a way where people don't have as much power on the local level. Both Narcos and The Wire show just how sophisticated the organization of these drug empires were. The men who led them were brilliant - creating essentially their own government, economy, and culture. 

Yes there are people who are just evil, and also people who do evil things. I'm not a fan of the terror that many criminals and criminal organizations create amongst their own people. But I still feel so much compassion for hypermasculine men who are basically displaced from their own cultures due to technological advancements, new political structures, and systems with rules that penalize their character.

"You know the narrative of female oppression isn't even historically accurate right? Women were always put on a pedestal in the West. They were protected and occupied a different role in society but they were not horribly mistreated like feminists like to claim. Women at every level of society either worked or were involved in their community in some way. If you look at the literature, films, and other media produced at this time it shows just how much freedom everyday women had. And if a woman didn't care about traditional roles? Different groups of women exercised tons of rights eg prostitutes owning property and guns and doing all sorts of things even back in the 1800s. The thing is when given the chance most women actively choose a life that is more traditional. Feminists crafted a narrative and have been warping everyone's understanding for nearly a century. If you look up the statements of prominent second wave feminists you can see exactly how they intentionally poisoned everyone's understanding of women's roles in the West. ",2,The_Donald
"The term “natural rights” is a philosophical concept that was integral to the establishment of America. [Here is a brief overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) that distinguishes between natural rights and legal rights, however the main takeaway is that natural rights are present from birth and not granted by any government or ruler. In addition to my belief in natural rights and natural law, I have what is known as a “constrained vision” of human nature. This means that I believe in an unchanging human nature, I believe that man is self-interested and flawed. [Here is more information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Conflict_of_Visions) on the theory of constrained vs. unconstrained visions, I am curious to know if you identify with the latter. The book A Conflict Of Visions is amazing if you are interested in politics, philosophy, and/or history!


Understanding that these are two things I consider axiomatic, hopefully you can see why I want a government that limits itself as much as possible. I believe that in the right conditions, local groups, churches, families, and charities will care for those in need. There has been a systematic dismantling of the nuclear family and this has made more people dependent on the state than ever. 

So no, I do not believe that healthcare is an intrinsic right. I also do not believe that anyone has the right to not be in debt. I support low taxes and want as much money in the pockets of the citizens so that they can spend it freely. I don’t think anyone should be compelled to have health insurance or pay for anyone else’s. I do believe that insurance companies should prioritise both health and profits, and do not support the corruption that has occurred. 

Similarly I do not think that women “deserve” to have anyone pay for their birth control or other elective health services. Not only is it not fair for those who oppose birth control to have to contribute their money to it, it just isn’t anyone else’s responsibility to ensure that a woman doesn’t have children. Viagra isn’t an equal comparison at all considering its purpose, but I also don’t think we should pay for that lol. 

In terms of abortion, even if you believe that the baby is not alive until it is born, I don’t think it is strictly a woman’s issue. At this moment in time women have 100% of the decision making power and the father has no legal right in this arena at all. If he does not want to be the father he is still forced to pay money for years and years, whereas if a woman doesn’t want to be a mother she can end the pregnancy without his permission. There are actually a lot of great secular arguments against the current abortion laws and feminist culture surrounding the issue. A baby’s heart starts beating at around 6 weeks, there are a lot of other developmental milestones that could be used to justify signs of life, and therefore it would make the baby under the jurisdiction of the government and entitled to rights. It no longer becomes an issue of autonomy or choice but rather a question of licit vs illicit killing.  I won’t dwell too much on this particular subject though. 

Re the question of taste, I think it is distasteful for anyone to make such statements, even if it was against Obama. When it comes to the speech, she did not intentionally plagiarize Michelle’s words, she explained exactly what happened, and Michelle’s speech was actually inspired by an earlier speech made by a different political woman about her husband, I will find a link about this and add it in. 

I think it’s great that you are aware that your views aren’t the default but hopefully you see the instances where others aren't. While I would love it if every person was able to be healthy, safe, sheltered, clothed, educated, and fed, I believe there are other ways of achieving this goal besides strong government intervention and taxation. Not that it would even be possible to 100% fix things but again this is a conflict between constrained vs unconstrained visions. It’s interesting that you don’t want me to lump you in with extremists but then wrap up your posts insinuating that I believe that people *deserve* to die. Hopefully I’ve clarified my perspective!

We have entirely different worldviews, from the very first premises to the last conclusions. I personally am a firm believer in traditional Western culture and values, I enjoy the works of various thinkers throughout time: Aristotle, Aquinas, the founding fathers, Thomas Sowell, etc. I am not a Republican or a tradcon and have numerous frustrations with both groups, some that even overlap with you! I do not share the same fears that you do when looking at Donald Trump's plan, I feel hope and patriotism.

I believe that each person is born with natural rights that are intrinsic, and when we have the freedom to exercise these rights without interference from the government, we can flourish. At this point in time Donald Trump is the candidate that puts Americans back on that path. 

As I stated earlier I am not a fan of the biased coverage that he received but more than that, I have a completely different set of values and therefore some things that he has legitimately said or done I do not consider an issue. One thing that I have observed and experienced first hand throughout the election cycle is the hypocrisy of those who oppose Trump. Not only has there been extreme violence, hatred, racism, and even sexism expressed towards Trump and his supporters, there have been several false hate crimes perpetrated by those on the left themselves. In times of crisis and conflict one's true character is revealed. I was never a fan of the Democratic party or other groups on the left but my opposition is cemented now. 

To bring this back to beauty, I don't find statements like ""Not My President"" to be ""tasteful"" at all. And while you may not be able to see this, posting support of things like women's marches, casual insults about Trump and his supporters, framing women who agree with him as traitors, diminishing Melania's style sense and beauty, etc. are all examples of bias, not neutrality, not morality. A lot of people on the left assume that their position is the obvious answer, the obvious and default way of understanding the world. Maybe people just don't understand that there are legitimately different ways of looking at things. When you dismiss people as hateful bigots you dismiss the efforts and ideas of centuries of brilliant philosophers, writers, and politicians. You dismiss the foundations of the West.",-3,muacjdiscussion

"Donald Trump's actual plans for the country are what matter the most to me. [This is a document](https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/_landings/contract/O-TRU-102316-Contractv02.pdf) that he has published outlining exactly what he plans to do within his first 100 days. He was one of the only candidates against TPP, and one of the only candidates who prioritized the safety and prosperity of American citizens above all else. I could go on but this is a makeup sub, feel free to PM me if you want to have a longer conversation about his platform and how he is reinvigorating American culture for the better. 

I will say that while I am a woman, gender is completely irrelevant to my political opinions. I completely disagree with the way the media has portrayed him and do not find him sexist, racist, xenophobic, etc. In fact he has been quite liberal throughout his life, and he has been a friend of the Democratic party for decades. He regularly hired both minorities and women at a time when others in his industry weren't and a lot of his more recent statements and positions have been twisted, taken out of context, or outright lied about. 

To bring this back to the subject of the OP, I have been very turned off by companies and influencers who tear down, mock, and insult those who hold different opinions.

So you agree that the pro trans messages are increasing. This is a good thing from your perspective but terrible in my opinion. 

> It seems perfectly reasonable for a layperson who knows little about the subject to trust experts unless given very good reason not to.

Yes this is human nature. The issue is when this tendency is exploited and people are manipulated and/or mislead. 

>I think there's an important distinction to be made between ""genuinely internally disordered in the sense of not being able to accomplish your own goals"" and ""mismatched in the sense of being a round peg in a social square hole"". 

Yep I agree with this as well. The issue is that a lot of behaviours are being classified as a mental illness and/or personality disorder when they don’t fall in line with modern ideas of what is normal and ideal. For example a lot of young boys have the ADD/ADHD label slapped on them because they can’t succeed in a school system that increasingly punishes natural male personalities and behaviours. The oppositional disorder that was discussed in the post I linked is similarly used to control children who don’t fit in today and whose parents are at a loss. 

>What I don't buy is the increasing claims of a global conspiracy of thousands of scientists, government organizations, and social advocates to collectively turn society into a totalitarian liberal hellscape

I’m not sure how many people literally believe this exact scenario that you outlined. What I believe and I have seen others argue is this: there are many different groups of people with different agendas, some of these groups are public others are hidden. In addition to these groups there are individuals with their own agendas, companies that also have goals, genuine people who believe they are doing the right thing that may be part of any of the aforementioned companies or groups, stupid people who are useful idiots for all of the above, people who are completely unaware of what’s actually going on wherever they are, people who may or may not know but regardless don’t care, and whichever other groups you can come up with. Each of these coalitions and/or individuals have agendas that compete with each other, mutual interests align, and outside factors have an impact. There is no 1 conspiracy that encompasses everything else, that all people are aware of and willingly participate in. I very rarely see that argument presented. What often happens is that people focus on some of the small, powerful, hidden groups and that can sometimes take on the tone of a “master conspiracy” since the people involved are indeed powerful. 

In terms of a “totalitarian liberal hellscape”, that is an excellent way to describe a very real reality that *some* groups do in fact want. Whether or not this is really possible in the near future I can’t say but if you’re a student of philosophy, history, and politics, the end goal of leftist/globalist elites is very apparent and also frightening! 

>particularly since you'd think such a conspiracy's first priority would be to, you know, not have Republicans in unified control of government as they will be tomorrow afternoon.

Have you been following the protests and false flags that have been going on throughout the election season that were funded by Soros to delegitimize Trump? Did you not see how hard nearly every mainstream media outlet tried to discredit Trump and ruin his chance at winning. It was nonstop propaganda every single day, and it hasn’t stopped now. There is a coordinated effort occurring presently to derail his administration. Official websites popped up to promote violence tomorrow (or rather in a few hours). Obama + co have talked about setting up what will essentially be a shadow government. They have not been quiet at all this entire time and they aren’t giving up either. And keep in mind when I say “they” I am referring to one of many groups as I mentioned earlier. I could go on but there's really so much on this subject alone. Stifling news stories and promoting false stories is the most obvious thing I can point you to in terms of ""conspiracy"".

">Nor do I think you should, since I happen to agree with them.

I don't agree with the media but I recognise that these messages are out there. I don't deny that your experience is accurate and representative of what other trans people may go through as well growing up. I just have a different perspective on both these things whereas you seemed to disagree with the idea that there was any support of trans people at all. At least in your first comment. 

As to your second point, I personally believe that a lot of the official organizations have so much political influence and interference so this is why I used that term. However, I am aware that it is not technically accurate and failed to communicate the larger point I was trying to make in my initial comment. So that one is on me! I disagree with the idea that the article didn't offer evidence of political motivation and your summary doesn't seem accurate either. As far as the status of homosexuality being a ""settled question"" that isn't relevant to the article at all, the example was used to show how changes in how things are defined officially shapes the culture. It's not about gay people in the 70's being ""powerful"", that claim was never made. The fact is the scientific opinion changed and the opinions of the public followed suit. That's why labeling actually normal behaviours as mental illnesses is so dangerous. 

Yes I agree that other organizations that have been mentioned in this thread are pushing conservative agendas. I haven't pointed to anything in my own posts precisely because of my stance on politics and medical definitions.

Your response was actually rude in comparison to what you could have said. If you were so worried about being offensive why would you say directly that you didn't like the other women?? That is only going to make people dislike you and/or feel hurt. If you just said something similar to the example that I gave they wouldn't have given it a second thought. 

You really over thought this and ended up doing something that wasn't the best course of action if you wanted to be polite. In addition, the situation you were struggling with isn't a situation where RPW even applies. These women are not your husband and your attendance at the event didn't involve your man. You don't need to submit or yield to these women, you are not obligated to be *their* GOFL. 

If you are worried about not being too passive or too much of a people pleaser, understand that it is possible to be assertive without going too far in the opposite direction. You can be sweet and fun without being a doormat, and you have zero reason to be this way to those who haven't earned it. 

Now another thing to keep in mind - your message itself is not a huge deal at all and what you sent isn't even an issue in the grand scheme of things. It is impolite but it's not ""un ladylike"" or anything. It was a simple text. I just wanted to speak to the mindset and conclusions you drew from this experience because they don't really line up with your actions.",8,RedPillWives
"I believe that there are only two sexes and do not like how sex, gender, gender identity, gender roles, and sexuality have all been separated from each other as concepts. Legitimate transgendered people are mentally ill and not actually experiencing some sort of biological crisis. That being said, there are a lot of people who believe themselves to be the wrong gender for many reasons other than ""gender identity dysphoria"" or whatever the official name for the condition is. 

To answer your questions:

I don't think it is possible for children to be trans at all. Could some people have symptoms of the dysphoria present at early ages? Sure.  But I don't think we can accurately diagnose these kids since there are so many factors and possibilties. Growing up and figuring out how to understand and deal with hormones, romantic feelings, lust, curiosity, and everything else is hard enough for regular kids. It is perfectly understandable that a child might develop feelings for a same sex friend or like certain aspects of the other sex without actually being gay or trans. There is such a strong pro gay and pro trans movement right now and so much encouragement for people to identify as either or both. I think this pushes children who are going through normal phases into lifestyles and choices that they would have grown out of naturally (or with some encouragement from their parents and peers). 

It is absolutely despicable that adults are intervening in the natural development of their children and forcing their politics on these kids' lives. Even without medical procedures the choices parents are making are dangerous to the mental and social health of their children. I think the absence of strong male leaders in the home is responsible. What actual masculine man is going to be okay with his son wearing makeup and prancing around in dresses? What masculine man is totally fine with his daughter rejecting her feminine beauty and engaging in alternative/deviant lifestyles?

I read the other day that there were new rules in place that would prevent doctors from refusing procedures for trans people that they previously would have opposed for scientific, moral, or religious reasons. This would mean that people would have to participate in all sorts of sexual ""reassignment"" procedures against their will and medical judgement. 

It's all just so terrible and the fact that parents are voluntarily pushing their children into these situations is the worst. Families are not democracies. Just because a kid feels a certain way one day doesn't mean he gets to make his own medical decisions. Parents have a responsibility to make sure their child grows up to be functional, well adjusted, healthy, people. Supporting trans delusions is the exact opposite!",8,RedPillWives

Great article! Loneliness is not often discussed as a consequence of feminism so this was a very interesting and refreshing read.

"It's both a communication issue and a fundamental disagreement about certain things. I won't try to change your mind but I will clarify the things that were misunderstood. Not everyone on the sub has to agree about every single thing but there are definitions and concepts that we all do have to at least agree are defined a certain way. Without a shared understanding of what an idea means discussion is impossible. We're seeing right here exactly how communication can get complicated if people aren't on the same page!

>It's not about 'force'. I'm saying people can do whatever path they want. 

When I used the term force it was to underscore the idea that we have autonomy and free will. I was not implying that you were under the impression that anyone was forced. I was making my own point about the range of possibilities and avenues available to every woman. Yes people can do what they want. That has never been part of the discussion at least on my end of things. 

>Who cares?

You don’t care and that’s fine. My whole point is that completely separate from how anyone *feels* about how to meet men, there are optimal and less optimal methods, and there are scenarios that will yield higher or lower chances of success. Also, individual women who seek dating advice may care about how they are perceived by their peers, family, coworkers, etc. It doesn’t mean that anyone else on this sub has to change the way that they evaluate themselves and their relationship’s history. We can all have different value and ethical systems. My arguments have been entirely removed from all of this and you seem to still think I’m saying things that I’m not. 

>It's not any less RP to get a man through being a plate and then convincing him to marry you as it is to date a man, hold off on sex until commitment, and then convincing him to marry you.

Now this is just objectively not true based on the definitions and concepts that we as a sub have agreed to. It can be your personal opinion, but it is **not** in line with the community’s position. 

My use of the term “acceptable” was not about morality. It was about how well an idea fit into the definition of RPW sexual strategy. I tried to be very explicit about this, using terms like optimal, efficient, effective, plans, thoughtful, intentional, etc. I also directly said at several points that a) I was not speaking about morality and b) there is no one RPW place or way to meet a man, there are many great places and great ways. 

The existence of a variety of different ways and methods =/= the way and/or method has no effect on the relationship. You may not care about the method or the potential effects and consequences, and you may not care about how others perceive your relationship. None of that changes the fact that there is a connection between how things start off and how a relationship will actually function.

That being said the location isn't the only factor so there can be both RPW and non RPW ways to meet men at a bar, just as there can be RPW and non RPW ways to meet a man at church.

What is considered trashy vs normal vs ideal differs based on location, class, ethnic group, and more. An understanding of what is valued in your circles is certainly important, even if you don't follow it. I don't think there is anything wrong with viewing specific places and ways of meeting and dating as immoral, tacky, bad, or any other negative value judgement. But I did want to clarify that in my discussions I have been focusing on the probabilities and consequences of meeting men in certain ways, not the ethics or popularity of the behaviour.

">Correct. In the SMP that exists AS IT DOES RIGHT NOW, there are so many variable ways women interact with potential boyfriends and husbands and it's not always pretty or clean or ideal. That's just the cards we were all dealt. All of us.

Yes but we are not forced to follow a specific path just because we are dealt certain cards. There is a lot in our control and the status quo of the SMP doesn’t have to dictate our personal sexual strategy. Just because other women are doing X doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do Y if Y will get you to where you want more effectively. Knowledge of the SMP and what works and doesn't work is part of RPW sexual strategy, when crafting a specific dating plan you don’t just rely on theories you apply them to your situation. No one can do anything perfectly, the fact that things aren’t clean or ideal doesn’t mean that there aren’t optimal paths. 

>I personally don't care how someone gets their SO, and the truth is most people don't either. You can meet him anywhere. You could be fuck buddies in college before deciding after 6 months that you both want something more serious and then commit to a relationship. You could meet at 15 and decide to court each other without so much as kissing ever until 18 and then marrying. You could be 35 and best friends for 15 years and then deciding you want to be with each other and grow old together. WHO. CARES.

I think this feeling right here is the source of miscommunication between us. When I see you write “it doesn’t matter how you get your man”, it doesn’t translate to “I personally don’t care how someone gets their SO” due to the context of the rest of your comment and the OP itself which was all about strategy. Now that you are expanding I see that you are talking about value judgements and your personal opinion. Your first comment did not give this impression, it appeared that you were making definitive statements about female sexual strategy and the validity (or lack thereof) of the RPW approach at different stages of the relationship. Does what I’m saying make sense? 

The fact that you personally don’t care, or that others in the country don’t care how a relationship begins, doesn’t mean that the way a relationship starts has no bearing on the potential success of the relationship. This is completely separate from any ethical systems or value judgements. That is the point I’ve been making. The feelings and how others perceive your relationship had no part in my comments I’ve only been speaking about probability and consequences. 

>Individual women can do whatever they want with men. But if and when they obtain a relationship with a man, there are basic things that men expect from their SOs regardless of background or the methods to which you got him to want to be with you. RPW is excellent in that regardless of who the woman is, or how she met her guy, if she's a popular sorority girl, a rock chick, a goth, a sperg loser, anything -- she can draw from what's discussed and make an individual relationship plan that works for her. Like don't be a shrew. Don't get in fights with him. Respect him in so and so ways. Stay attractive to him based on his preferences. Etc.

Right, and this was never something I felt was being questioned. 

>But on the real, a lot of what we discuss is not practical pre-commitment in today's SMP. A lot of it can solely be implemented once in a relationship.

The whole point of RPW is coming up with a plan that makes sense for your life and your situation. As I said in my post it’s about being efficient and effective, using resources strategically, etc. Is it not practical for a woman to think ahead, vet men, put effort into her appearance, be fun and engaging with men, avoid becoming a plate or any other ambiguous relationship zone? Single women who have an accurate understanding of their RMV, male nature, and their local SMP can approach dating with an advantage that the average woman does not have. Yes it takes more effort but that’s because the results are worth it. If anything is not practical for an individual it means either their plan is wrong or they need to improve themselves and get more discipline/motivation/self awareness/some other missing trait. 

There is a lot in RPW that is restricted to relationships yes, but that doesn’t mean that RPW has no place outside of a relationship. Girl game, traditional dynamics, and good character are important at every step. I don’t believe the definition of RPW is as limited as a lot of people seem to think I may make a post about this in the future.


>It doesn't matter what is ""acceptable"". Feminism for a good segment of the SMP is considered acceptable.

Again you're arguing something I haven't been saying. I'm actually going to take this idea further and use it to reinforce what I've been saying about going against the grain in the SMP, it doesn't matter what other women are doing. RPW is about looking out for your self interest not being acceptable. 

>A good portion of women in this sub met their men in what would have been unacceptable ways 50, 30, even 15 years ago. But they have a man who they want to keep? We can absolutely help them with that.

Of course, and again, never said anything contrary to this. But like I said to Iris, just because RPW can help people who are in bad relationships or who started relationships out via a certain way, doesn't mean that single women don't need to be thoughtful or intentional when dating. 

Also I do want to clarify that I do not think that meeting a man at a bar or party is objectively un RPW. This will be something I expand on in that future post I mentioned. There is not an ""RPW location"" to meet a man, although there are certainly locations that are un RPW. Just like how there is no one way to dress as an RPW but plenty of ways that are un RPW to dress! That being said the location isn't the only factor so there can be both RPW and non RPW ways to meet men at a bar, just as there can be RPW and non RPW ways to meet a man at church.",1,RedPillWives
And your advice is always wonderful! :),5,RedPillWives
"I don't think that you're understanding the implications of your first comment. 

It absolutely matters how you get him - there are just a multitude of great ways to get a man. Bar vs grocery store vs class vs work are all different examples of completely valid ways to get a man. There are also several not great ways to get a man, which I mentioned in the last comment and in the sexual strategy post. You are making a blanket statement that it doesn't matter how. I am saying, yes it does.  If you are trying to make a nuanced statement about the acceptable ways, saying that library vs party doesn't matter that is fine, and I'd agree. But you haven't been saying that, you've been saying that it doesn't matter *at all* and that is a message that is completely at odds with RPW for all the reasons that I explained. 

>and you exude qualities that encourages him to stay and commit to you.

This is exactly the point of RPW at all stages of dating so you seem to be changing your mind about the fact that RPW doesn't apply prior to relationships. You have to exude qualities that get him to escalate commitment on the first dates and within an LTR. ",2,RedPillWives
"The way that you got your man, trashy or not, doesn't mean that you can't now apply RPW ideas to your relationship. But this doesn't mean that single women should completely disregard RPW theory and strategy and just wait until they are married to start being great women. Many women would have better marriages if they had access to RPW at an earlier age and could apply the ideas while dating and at the early stages of the LTR and marriage. ",6,RedPillWives

"Actually there is a specific approach to RPW relationships, I detail this in my [Female Sexual Strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/comments/5hz4md/female_sexual_strategy/) post. 

The way that you get a man makes a huge difference in the success of your relationship. Any single woman who is interested in a harmonious marriage should navigate the SMP with a different set of values and an approach that both reflects who she is and gets her what she wants. Not all approaches to dating are equal. There are many terrible ways to start off a relationship - faking a pregnancy, intentionally getting pregnant, stealing someone else's man, etc. There are also really inefficient approaches - trying to befriend a bunch of guys before dating them, sleeping with every man who makes himself available, etc. 

If you apply the ideas that are discussed throughout this community during the dating process you will have an easier time finding a man who is compatible and wants the same type of relationship. I explain in my post the reasoning behind RPW sexual strategy so I won't repeat myself here but basically there are efficient and effective methods to obtain commitment that involve an intentional use of all of our resources. It sounds more technical when I write about it in the post or the vetting men post but really it's simple in application and meshes easily with one's life.

If marriage is a top priority for someone the ""how"" should also be a top priority. It's not just going to randomly happen and the more control you exert over the process the better chances you have of happiness within your relationship. 


>It's what you do to keep him, and that's where RPW comes in.

As I say in the female sexual strategy post: girl game, traditional dynamics, and good character are the essential foundations of RPW. There is not a point in the relationship process where these three things aren't being displayed in some way. You have to do more to get commitment in the first place than just existing, RPW comes in to play to get from date 1 to date 2 just as it can help get to date 1 in the first place. **Different aspects of RPW are relevant at different relationship stages.**  

If the entire time while dating you behaved X way, *that* is what a man is committing to. How are you going to find someone who shares the same values as you and wants the same type of relationship and future if you aren't acting in a way that is consistent with the type of life you want to lead? Are you just going to have hypothetical discussions about how you'll be once you're in a relationship, so that he can have something to hope for? What man with options is going to continue seeing someone who doesn't give him the relationship experience that he wants? It just doesn't make any sense. 

**When you are consistent from day 1 a man knows exactly what he is signing up for and you can vet him based on how well he does in the role as the head of the relationship.** You can assess his personality, temperament, vision, authenticity, etc. and make decisions about whether or not you want to move forward. If you just date without thought to the future or without evaluating and reflecting, you're doing yourself a disservice. 

Finally you can't get good at being in relationships with men without practice. You have to actually apply things in order to know what works and what doesn't for you. If you save everything for a serious relationship you'll have a harder time actually putting it to use because it'll be completely new. If a woman doesn't practice gratitude, yielding, being supportive, being a GOFL, etc. prior to commitment, how is she going to excel at that once she is in a relationship? That's just not how women work. We condition ourselves and fall into patterns. It isn't practical to advise anyone to be inconsistent in the way you're describing. 

>So in terms of dating, by all means. Once you're in a committed relationship, it's important to keep certain hard truths in mind 

The truths about male and female nature and female sexual strategy are important to keep in mind at all times while dating. The advantage that you'd get in the SMP following RPW advice makes any other approach seem pointless and/or dumb. ",5,RedPillWives

"Just to be clear the term ""submission"" is still perfectly applicable to LTRs, some women are more comfortable with other terms but it is not more accurate to say ""deference"". Have you read [this post on female sexual strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWives/comments/5hz4md/female_sexual_strategy/), I speak about the different uses of RPW at each relationship stage. 

There is no point during the relationship process where a woman is not making use of the 3 main categories of RPW - girl game, traditional dynamics, and good character. Whether it's date one or year 15 psychological femininity is encouraged. If you'll recall in my post this means being receptive, yeilding, supportive, open, etc. There is no reason why someone can't do this while dating and vetting men, and when deal breakers come up that's when you reevaluate and potentially move on. 

As /u/irisandoleander said, RPW is not synonymous with ""blindly follows orders from SO no matter what. And to emphasize the point, ""submission"" does not mean that either! ",3,RedPillWives

"Absolutely! And it is sad, but I think that we'll see a lot more women wake up and reject feminism now thanks to Trump and the new culture he is ushering in. ",2,RedPillWives
"This is great info thanks for sharing it with us! Of course it's appropriate, knowing who she is and what she believes gives us more context for this article. I totally agree she is pushing a feminist agenda through her work, her neutral tone just conceals her bias and intentions. ",4,RedPillWives
"Oh yes there was never any expectation that *Time* would delve into these things haha unfortunately the way they present the ideas influences how others consider the subject, so I thought it was worth looking at the implicit lessons being imparted in addition to the main points. They definitely did as good of a job as they could with neutrality, even if they still were promoting feminist ideas and myths like the gender pay gap. Something I just thought about right now - I can easily imaging women reading this article and thinking ""Why do men get to do nothing at home and be the happier ones? That isn't fair, when do I get to be happy?!"" Their tit for tat mentality may only be strengthened by a piece like this. And if they actually follow the advice and bring up divorce? That would be awful!",5,RedPillWives
"This article brought up a lot of issues that people are facing but the feminist bias prevented them from talking about some of the causes and solutions to those problems. 

One thing that didn't get brought up but I feel like it contributes to the stress women feel is that they don't just want a sharing of household duties, they want to share the leadership position as well. So they have multiple sources of pressure at home whereas if they only focused on certain things, they would feel more at ease. When the responsibilities are clearly outlined it is easier to get things done. If both parties are expected to do everything, and without any explicit guidelines, of course it will feel overwhelming and one or both people will get resentful! There are many members of RPW who work and also take on the traditional roles at home and they are still able to be a ""goddess of fun and light"" precisely because they're not trying to run *everything* at home. Yielding to their partners and specialising in certain areas allows their minds to rest!

I also think this article ignores the very real pressure that men feel every day, especially those that are in the traditional male role as the head of the household. The idea that they aren't thinking all the time at home is solipsistic - just because he doesn't have the same thoughts or concerns as you doesn't mean he isn't thinking at all. It really diminishes all that men do for the family. The article was trying to frame the situation as men kicking their feet up and being happy and relaxed while women toil away when that just isn't the case. 

It's interesting that basically all relationships tend to fail at equal division of labour. That is completely in line with what we discuss on RPW all the time. But instead of questioning the concept of equality within relationships, and considering alternative models that could lead to both parties feeling fulfilled, women feel justified in leaving their man. I feel like this shows just how unfit for the male workforce most women are. They can't handle running a home, being a wife, being a mother, and having a career/intense full time job.

This article really tried to give a neutral overview of the situation but the final lessons are a bit lacking. ""There are forces bigger than us"" is so vague and doesn't really capture the reality of what all the studies showed. To me it's clear that we are predisposed to certain relationship structures and roles, and the unhappiness that women feel is not because of traditional dynamics but instead due to their attempt to have the best of both worlds (or abandon the female sphere entirely). And the advice - ""we need to talk to our spouses and potential spouses about our ideal plans and our backup plans"" could lead to some issues. Are women supposed to tell their men to do housework or they get a divorce? What about when men try to talk to their women about what they want, does Time want women to respect these desires? How can you compromise between the two I don't really see a way that could work long term. One person is going to lose.

"> I usually lose respect for a SAHM when I see that her entire Facebook feed is about justifying her choice to be a SAHM (for example, those videos/infographics about how ""A SAHM is worth more than 100K per year!""). It reeks of insecurity. Also, while that kind of SAHM are on Facebook, they aren't taking care of the house nor the kids, now are they.

I **really** don't like a lot of these types of arguments in favour of SAHM. When you justify homemaking and mothering by equating it with things in the masculine sphere and judging it through a male lens, you're saying that a lifestyle or choice isn't of value unless it is in line with male standards. There are many intrinsic and intangible benefits to staying at home and it's not all about the money, or how hard it is, or how busy the mom is. Women at home shouldn't have to compete with those in the workforce by signaling how productive they are or any other workplace virtue. Being an SAHM or just a homemaker in general is *not* as difficult as plenty of actual jobs. AND THAT IS TOTALLY FINE! Women and men are different.

"I’m not sure if you posted this post because you feel like it is in line with RPW ideas or if you are posting it for us to dissect and discuss. I’ll assume the second one though because this is definitely *not* what RPW is interested in at all. I have too many thoughts so I’ll just do bullet points and respond to things chronologically!

* The distinction people are making between Islam and Islamism is idiotic and only further preventing people from addressing the very real issue. It isn’t some extreme faction of the faith that is perpetuating violent acts, and it isn’t a small proportion that want to see Islamic culture replace existing Western cultures. There are tons of studies, polls, and in depth resources that explain this in greater detail, it’s not the point of the post so I won’t dwell too long on this. But for the article to open by comparing modern feminism to “Islamism” is a terrible sign haha

* Feminists don’t own the idea of men and women having equal rights under the law. The granting of specific legal rights to women is not and has never been the totality of feminism. There have always been statements about male and female nature, roles in society, and more that are mixed in with the subject of legal rights. It is 100% possible to believe that women should have access to education or property rights without also agreeing with feminism. 

* The assertion that feminism has improved civilisation and that we should be proud of what it’s accomplished is just hilarious! This sub talks a lot about the negative impact feminism has on the SMP but it has also negatively affected the economy, politics, and our culture. 

* Pretending that it’s only modern feminists who are “extreme” is ignoring the history of feminism itself.

* “Feminism, by its classic definition, is the advocacy for gender equality. “ Believing that men and women are objectively equal in worth and/or deserve equal rights is not the same thing as being a feminist. Feminists believe that men and women are the same, that the only reason there are gender differences is because of one’s upbringing and cultural pressure. This is a major tenet that drives so many of their claims and actions. 

* I disagree that its necessary to have a feminist movement to fight for issues. A lot of things that are currently labeled as “women’s issues” really don't have to be “women’s issues”. For example abortion, it involves 2 or 3 people, depending on your view of when life starts. For the purpose of this comment let’s just focus on the parents. Currently women have 100% of the decision making power when it comes to bringing life into the world and men have to deal with it no matter what. If she has a baby and he doesn’t want it, he is still financially obligated to pay for it. If he *does* want a baby and she doesn’t, she can just kill it without his input, even if they are married. It’s more than just a woman’s issue, its a family issue, and when men are boxed out, and all women are lumped together by feminists claiming to be speaking for us, so many people are unhappy and unheard. 

* “Healthy feminism” is an oxymoron lol 

* “Feminism is a movement that fights for gender equality in status, rights, and opportunities. “ What this really means is fighting to have women be viewed on par with men, valuing the male sphere more than the female sphere, and wanting to exercise masculine hard power. In addition it means extending the power of the state so that these new rules and standards can be enforced. It also is pretty irrelevant today – what legal rights do women not have that men do? If anything women have *more* rights.

 
Yes this article calls out a lot of bad things about modern feminism, but classic feminism or “healthy feminism” isn’t any better!

"You’re right that huge decisions where the man’s veto power is used don’t come up super often in most of the relationships in RPW, but I think this is likely because when you employ RPW concepts and tips, the relationship becomes more harmonious and you’re more likely to agree in general. Submission isn’t only seen in single acts, it can be practised daily just by embracing traditional relationship dynamics and psychological femininity. While users have different personal definitions of submission and some prefer “deference”, the main idea is to avoid conflict by yielding and being his soft place to land. Thinking of things in terms of being in a state of “yielding” instead of an act of “submission” might help you see how a large portion of the content on this sub shows everyday examples of RPW in action. 

Being in a traditional dynamic doesn’t mean that you don’t have autonomy, responsibilities, or decision making powers. This is exactly why we use the Captain/First Mate analogy (even if some people take it too far lol) - to illustrate how our role requires action and decisiveness, it’s not passive, it’s two people doing different things to achieve the same goal. 

The way that each woman actually chooses to apply RPW depends on her personality, her man’s personality, their relationship dynamic, and other factors. Some things I’ve noticed that we all have in common is putting our man first. As a really tiny example of this: giving him the bigger piece of meat/the most attractive looking food that we make. It’s not anything lifechanging but it’s a small gesture that shows our respect. More examples: always saying yes to sex, dropping everything to focus on him when he wants to talk (in person or via phone), asking for permission before agreeing to social engagements, ending friendships with people he doesn’t approve of, cooking food for him that you don’t like or eat, doing something he requests that he doesn’t have time for, never speaking poorly about him in public, etc.

Similarly male leadership comes in many forms. Some men lead explicitly with directions, commands, requests, meaningful gestures or facial expressions, boundaries, etc. and others lead implicitly - they set the frame and you either comply or you’re out (it won’t feel that harsh though in practice). /u/TempestTcup and I discuss this a lot, and she has some great thoughts!

I know others will go more in depth on what they do personally but I hope this helps clarify some things! The main point I wanted to make is that on a daily basis it’s more about being yielding and a soft place to land. If you read the feild reports and the comments in many posts w/ the flair “Discussion” or “Insightful” you’ll see plenty of women talking about what they do in their relationship.

"Yeah I thought this article was really funny! 

I agree context is key, but so many girls rock the hipster look on a daily basis. It's more than just casual or outdoorsy, there's a specific aesthetic and even if you do engage in outdoor activities it's easy to not look like a lesbian at the same time lol. I find it so interesting when choices that signal a specific lifestyle become mainstream or even cool. 

I'm not familiar with the lesbian subculture so I have no idea what they do now to differentiate themselves (intentionally or otherwise). But I definitely agree that a lot of millennials today end up looking like lesbians, just as a lot of guys end up looking really gay!

There have been tons of trends in America that seemed authentic on the surface but really it was just a new status competition. As an example: minimalism.

Of course this doesn't happen at every level of society but amongst UMC+ adopting ""minimalism"" was a great way to signal.

"> This wasn't mentioned at all in the article but I was also thinking recently about how holiday traditions are made much better with the presence of children. Some aspects seem pointless when it's just adults. Currently in my family it's just adults and pets in the dinner party, and while it's very pleasant, there's a certain aspect of the holidays that is there just for children. I've been thinking that very often the way millennials try to recreate their childhood looks immature and ridiculous because it's done alone, and not with their own children to relive them with. In this sense it's not childhood nostalgia that is misplaced, but that the children timeline doesn't come soon enough.

Brilliant!! I noticed this myself comparing my Christmas this year vs last year. This year there were tons of children around, last year it was all adults and 1 baby. The mood was totally different and this Christmas felt more authentic but I had no idea why. And I feel like you were expanding this post beyond the holidays, if so I agree. Millennials don't have kids yet so they often take on the role of both kid and adult to make up for the lack of energy/perspective/joy a child would bring to a given situation. Not consciously of course.  ",1,RedPillWives
"This is such a great read! I still prefer Robert Nozick's definition of love, but I like the how they gave concrete examples and advice instead of all theory or scientific jargon. 

Of course #7 is something I disagree with. They say that in the best relationships, both parties are ""Noncontrolling, nonmanipulative and nonthreatening"" and that ""In order for a relationship to be truly loving, it must be equal."" I question the biases of the people conducting the study as well as their methods in assessing equality, and also their definition of ""equality"", ""dominance"", ""submission"", and ""control"". The paragraph expanding on #7 says:

>Many couples find themselves wrapped up in dynamics where one acts like a parent and the other like a child. One looks to the other for guidance then resents that person for telling them what to do. Or one person tries to control the situation, then complains that the other person is irresponsible, immature, or passive. In order for a relationship to be truly loving, it must be equal. When one person tries to control or manipulate the other, be it by yelling and screaming or stonewalling and playing the victim, neither person is experiencing an adult, equal, and loving relationship.

I'm not sure if the opening sentence is supposed to frame the topic of the following paragraph, are the next two sentences expanding on the idea of parent/child dynamics specifically? Do they see all unequal relationships as parent/child? Even if each sentence is to be interpreted independently, the statements reveal a lot of misconceptions. The most obvious one being that not all hierarchical relationships take on a parent/child dynamic, as we all know in RPW! 

When you look at the description of each party, it is clear that the issue isn't with the fact that the hierarchy exists, but rather the people involved are not suited for that role. If you get resentful after asking for help, that is a problem with your character. If you take control and then complain that the other person does nothing, that is a problem with *you*, not the concept of leading itself. I wish they spoke more about gender in this paragraph. Women seem to complain more about having to do all the work and be in control while their man is irresponsible/immature/and passive. Women who haven't mastered psychological femininity are also more likely to resent help even when they need it, but men who are in the second position against their preferences will feel the same way. 

While a lot of dysfunctional relationships have poor power imbalances, that doesn't mean that the best relationships have *zero* imbalances. Many of us here have friction-less relationships precisely because of the inequality. When we ask for help we are grateful to receive it, and our men enjoy their role as ""Captain"". The people inside of the relationship are what determine it's success, that's why we focus so much on our own character and it's also why we heavily promote vetting men!

"Tl;dr: get over yourself!

First, welcome to the community, and thank you for coming to us for advice, please understand that the women commenting are taking time out of their day to help you and while some may employ a bit of tough love, it's only because we feel like you need a bit of a reality check :) 

Your husband seems like a man who really prides himself in his ability to provide for his family. It isn't surprising then that he would be embarrassed to rely on food banks or that he would try to hide the source of the groceries from you. Can you put yourself in his shoes for a second and think about the pressure he must be feeling, not only to support his wife and children, but to live up to his standards? 

Your reaction to this situation is over dramatic. 

>Reality is this hazy thing, what is real, what is fake? I'm so extremely depressed since this happened, I don't even know what to think anymore :(

This is just not necessary! You don't know what to think? Think about how *human* your man is. He has insecurities and worries and he sounds like he is doing the best he can. You've been struggling financially so he probably already feels terrible - going to a food bank is essentially admitting that he failed. (From his perspective, not saying that any of this is objectively true!)

Here is what you can do moving forward: 

* Never ask where groceries come from again. 

* Show gratitude for all that he does, make him feel like a man. Do not be patronizing or manipulative with this. If you need examples or clarification definitely ask. 

I know you're sensitive due to his past actions (/u/phantomdream09 speaks more on this) but you have to remember that he isn't perfect. We all lie to ourselves and try to minimize our shortcomings. We also all try to hide our failures from those who's opinions we value the most. It really isn't a huge deal that he didn't tell you the food was from a food bank, but you spiraling out of control will only justify him keeping things like this from you. Make it clear with your actions that you can be a source of support for him! ",2,RedPillWives
">Feminists in general are more likely to have very strong world views 

This is just ridiculous. You can have strong or weak worldviews regardless of your political ideology. Feminist women are not somehow more advanced and strong willed. Non feminist women can **strongly** oppose feminism and prefer traditional dynamics. 

>Some women who prioritise a harmonious relationship and stable family life over their own interests, careers and convictions 

We don't choose a relationship over our interests, careers, or convictions. Our interests and conventions **include** a harmonious relationship.

"You're welcome! I feel like the definition of femininity has narrowed as time has gone on because people see being female as one of many qualities instead of an overarching category that contains most of the other qualities. No idea if that makes sense at all so let me know if I need to clarify. Basically we think of a lot of characteristics as universal human traits now instead of masculine and feminine traits. Which results in the mistaken idea that femininity is separate from all other personality traits, instead of an underlying influence that informs your entire personality and character. 

I think the pressure and anxiety that a lot of people feel today is from lack of real life social interaction and feedback. And a general lack of community that would give a sense of belonging and a baseline. There is a lot of discussion on this subject on [this site](http://akinokure.blogspot.com/), just look at the ""cocooning"" tag!",3,RedPillWives

>I think another reason that we won't admit is that careers just aren't as valuable and exciting as many people claim they are. There are some people who are able to make their career and their vocation one and the same thing. They are the lucky ones. Most of us however don't have a vocation or if we do it's not one we can make a living out of, most of us work for the money alone. So people spend thousands going to Uni for an education for a career that ultimately doesn't really bring them the satisfaction that they hoped for.

I think this is part of the reason most women don't really thrive in the modern workplace especially in traditionally male positions. That environment just isn't structured for female nature, which of course is great for business, but bad for personal happiness.

"I always love when you mention Strauss and Howe's Generational Theory. The first time I read it my mind was blown and it's impossible to look at current events without thinking about their ideas. The cocooning vs social theory definitely falls in line with the Four Turnings concept, and it is incredible watching my generation literally fall apart right now.

I agree with your takeaways, it makes sense that a realistic understanding of our strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies, would lead to a greater sense of self acceptance and happiness. When women delude themselves into thinking that sex/gender has no relevance, they are setting themselves up for disappointment one way or another. And don't get me started on the decline of men!

"I thought this was a great exploration of some of the potential reasons many women today report feeling depressed.

The entire point of Phantom's comment was to point out your bad reasoning. You took a literal interpretation of a singular statement that she made and the comment you linked to actually proves that she wasn't saying that women were *entirely* in control. You have been creating arguments about things no one else was talking about and over complicating a subject that really didn't need it.

"Do you understand that you started a completely different conversation with Phantom without giving any indication that you were doing so? You kept responding and not connecting your thoughts or explaining your thought process. Not only that but you did not engage with anything Phantom was saying about your original comment. You zeroed in on the **least relevant part** and refused to listen when she told you that you were bringing up unrelated things. 

When you comment within an existing conversation, everyone assumes that you are adding your thoughts to the mix. Everything you say is assumed to be in response to the subject at hand. Each point you make will be judged against the current topic, and every time you bring other things up - regardless of how much sense it makes to you - it looks like you are shifting goal posts and trying to avoid the direct arguments made against what you said. 

The whole thing about responsibility vs not honestly just seems like you over-complicating something that no one else thinks is an issue. Furthermore it has absolutely nothing to do with the original point of Phantom's response, which was calling out your reasoning. **You** are the only one who is conflating morality and responsibility and so that is just something you'll have to figure out yourself. I'm not sure how else we can say that a) no you aren't morally responsible for what people think and you can't directly control perception but b) you are capable of affecting and influencing which is where RPW comes in for single women.

"I totally love the idea of having levels just like the male version but to me this doesn't seem like desire game but rather the basic steps that all users are encouraged to do when they decide to apply RPW to their lives. Most of the things on this list should be done before desire game ever becomes an option, and I think the very last level should be leaving the man/divorce/separation. In a different comment to this post I outlined some thoughts on when desire game could be used. To me, desire game should be a more ""advanced"" option, that is used when everything else has already been tried. I feel like it's useful when the issue is the man (or both the man and the woman). 

What are your thoughts on this? I am really excited that /u/yetieater made this post because we get to create brand new RPW theory together, from scratch, as a community. So far most of the theorising happens in IRC, private conversations, and in our own minds. I love bringing it out into the open and collaborating as a subreddit. So thanks for being part of this :) ",2,RedPillWives
"Yay!! 

So we totally need a new name other than “dread game” so that people don’t get the wrong idea (building off of /u/PhantomDream09’s comment how about “desire game”?). But what the two approaches have in common is that they are used when normal RP means aren’t enough to achieve the desired results. Men use dread game when the issue is their wives, women can use “desire game” when they have done all they can through normal RPW strategy and need a more focused solution to the issue. In these cases their man may be at fault, or it could be something else that isn’t 100% in her direct control. I thought about some conditions where this female version could be applied: 

* Outside of LTR - You really like a guy but he isn’t escalating commitment. This would be a last ditch effort before nexting him. 

* Within an LTR, prior to marriage - You love this man, want to spend the rest of your life with him, but he isn’t showing any signs of proposing. Again the final solution may be leaving him. 

* Within an LTR that is clearly headed to marriage and also within marriages - You love this man but there is disharmony. He might be too beta, too alpha, or disinterested in general. You are doing what you can but the issue isn’t 100% your fault. How to make things better without leaving him, controlling him, or arguing? 

* Married only - You suspect your man has a wandering eye or he may already be involved with someone else. You are interested in salvaging the relationship and winning back his focus. 

What do you guys think of these conditions, did I leave anything out?

"You are being extremely literal. In addition to being super literal, you are arguing a point that no one is contesting. No one was discussing control vs influence just like no one was discussing can vs should. We were discussing the optimal way to achieve a result, and how to best classify the different avenues women take. You inserted yourself into our conversation. When you bring up these unrelated things, it comes across as you taking a position within the existing argument, and in this case it came across as you opposing RPW.

Can you see all the ways you changed the topic, ignored Phantom’s points, and argued things that a) weren’t related to the convo in progress and b) weren’t clearly defined from the start. You just assumed that everyone knew your point but if you look again at your first comment, there is NO WAY that anyone could have guessed what your goal was. It really just looked like you dismissing the value of RPW because “anyone can do anything”.

Welcome everyone!! ,5,RedPillWives
Glad I could help!,1,RedPillWives
">Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, it sounds like the fundamental difference here is for what single women 'should' use as their sexual strategy.

The fundamental issues being discussed are: can strategies and choices be RP but not RPW? And what determines the “RP”ness of a strategy or choice? While we used examples that involved single women this is a question that applies to every stage of a relationship. 

>A single woman, in theory, has not acquired exclusive commitment from a man and is therefore not responsible for a man's needs.

Single women are not “responsible for a man’s needs” but that doesn’t mean that their choices prior to obtaining commitment are made without any consideration to male preferences. As I mentioned in the post they need to consider their appearance and behaviour as they are on the market and actively dating. The way they treat men at this state is important, and demonstrating consideration of the man and his needs will go a long way in signaling that they are worth commitment. 

>a single woman can theoretically accept RP truths while pursuing any one of the strategies you list above as being outside of RPW.

Sure a single woman *can* pursue alternate strategies but it doesn’t mean that it is the most optimal choice. Again as I pointed out in the OP you have to consider the effectiveness, efficiency, level of risk, and potential consequences. As far as accepting all RP concepts but still choosing a different path, how likely is it that a woman will legitimately understand everything RP and RPW has to say, want to get married, but then decide that her best shot at marriage is faking a pregnancy/being a mistress/being a sugar baby/casual sex? Do you think this is realistic at all?

Now when it comes to single women who aren’t interested in marriage, I already gave the conditions where their actions could be RP. But that group is outside of the scope of this subreddit, and when women talk about RP vs RPW choices they are usually referring to non RPW means of obtaining RPW goals. And that is rarely the most optimal strategy for all of the reasons I outlined in this post. 

>Just like what you're saying, I think it makes sense to inform single women on why their strategy may be highly unlikely to garner them what they want --- it makes sense to not endorse alternative strategies (especially if they are sabotaging men). But beyond providing information and guidance when asked, I do agree that a single woman's decision is her own and I wouldn't tell her what she 'should' do.

You are misunderstanding my point. RPW sexual strategy is all about the most optimal way to achieve the goal of a harmonious marriage. Now if someone doesn’t want marriage or a traditional marriage then fine, the sub isn’t for them. But we absolutely advocate a specific path to marriage - having the best SMV and RMV possible, knowing the type of man you want, vetting constantly as you date, having sex thoughtfully, traditional dynamics once within the relationship, etc. 

When I said that for others X choice might be the most optimal for them *as they are* the key part was that it was only optimal from that woman’s perspective because it is the *easiest* solution without any change on their part. RPW in contrast often requires change on some level. We 100% believe that there are stupid and ineffective ways to try to achieve marriage, and that there are risky strategies that while successful for some, are not worth it for many. 

The subreddit itself presents the case for RPW both explicitly and implicitly but no it doesn’t force or command anyone to do anything. We literally cannot force anyone to do anything, and we’re not trying to. But that doesn’t mean that we endorse every decision everyone makes just because they had the freedom to make it. When people ask for advice or we speak in generalities we talk about *shoulds* and it’s entirely from the standpoint of what is the most optimal path - how to get from A to B the fastest way, with the least friction. The answer to *that* 98% of the time is RPW strategy. 

>FOR WOMEN IN EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS, lol, gosh, her decisions affect her relationship with her man!! 

The decisions of single women affect that woman’s chances of ending up with the right man, or any man at all. They also affect any man she is dating, and they could affect any future men if she makes a choice that leaves physical or emotional damage. 

>So while her decisions may be her own, if she's coming to RPW for advice, she'll realize soon enough that this community isn't going to coddle her for making decisions that are mistreating her man

We’re not going to coddle anyone, single or married!

Yeah I don't know if its possible to have too many good traits but it is definitely possible to misuse the good traits. If you're super strict and hold everyone to extremely high standards you'll probably be viewed as dull or rigid.

>Marriage doesn't seem to be held in the proper respect anymore. 

This may be true in some areas and social circles but that doesn’t change the actual legal benefits that marriage affords to a couple. And there are far more people who still view marriage as an essential right of passage for adults, they just aren’t represented as well on the internet. 

>It's true that those arts are lost on women because, to be fair, we simply don't need them anymore. And while that's a shame, RP has always championed operating within how reality is and opposed to should be. While it's certainly nice to be able to provide a man with all those things, at this point you really can't deny it's inefficient. 

I disagree with this and feel this attitude is part of why a lot of men don’t find women worth marriage or even formal commitment anymore. I listed those categories of resources precisely because they are essential to female sexual strategy. It isn’t inefficient at all to develop the exact skills that men value so that he doesn’t have to outsource them. 

The more you bring to the table, the more of an asset you are to his life. Maybe you don’t like cooking but literally not being able to prepare a tasty meal would be a huge issue for a lot of men. Perhaps you can afford to have a maid or cleaning service, but not knowing how to make a house feel like a home? You’ll pale in comparison to the woman who has this talent. If you don’t look attractive or have the requisite RMV men won’t take a second look. If your only selling points are that you have a winning personality and are fertile...you’re not a catch. No one is that great! 

>This becomes even more valuable than ever before. Which is actually a huge opportunity! A true lady is rarer than ever, and the scarcity of that can really own stand to work in our favour.

*All* of the resources are more valuable than ever not just the last two. I pointed out which should be the top priority because a lot of people spend too much time focusing on looks or cleaning and not enough time developing their character. This post is about explaining the foundations of RPW and so ranking each resource is part of that. Doesn’t mean that we consider any of them irrelevant to female sexual strategy. 

---------------------------

Before I respond to the specific point you made at the end of your comment I want to clarify some things that I thought were clear from this post:

* RP = acknowledging reality (especially male and female nature), being guided by rational self interest, and making the most optimal choices given the situation and your goals 

* RPW = striving to achieve a harmonious marriage using girl game, traditional dynamics, and good character. It falls under the RP umbrella because the choices we make to achieve this goal are supposed to be the most optimal ones give the situation and our goals. It involves acknowledging reality and rational self interest, but it also involves “Team Harmony” and the goals and methods are more limited. 

So based on these definitions, RP itself is more than just knowing the consequences. It’s not an “anything goes as long as you know the risks” situation. Yes technically anyone can do anything they want. But that doesn’t mean that what they are doing is an RP choice. 

Some examples of female sexual strategies that are outside of RPW: getting pregnant so that a man will marry you, breaking up a marriage, settling for “top plate” in the hopes that you’ll shine above all the other plates, choosing to be a single mom, being a sugar baby, casual sex, sex tourism, and being just a regular plate. Knowledge of men and women, having personal agency, awareness of reality and consequences, etc. are all possible in these situations. While all of these women could change something about themselves and/or their situation and pursue an RPW path, it may in fact be the most optimal choice (for where they are right now) to use a different strategy. It would be more optimal because it would be easier for them (at least from their perspective) not saying that anyone here is endorsing any of these methods. 

Even if they could technically be RP, most people who engage in anything that I listed above are **not** doing so from an RP perspective. I think it’s dishonest to describe any of the alternate strategies as RP in the same way/similar way that RPW is RP. RP is about maximising the chance of success and minimising risks and negative consequences. It’s about acting intentionally and with thought to both the short and long term. 

How many women are truly better off stealing someone’s husband vs following the RPW path? How many women are better off spermjacking or even faking a pregnancy vs following the RPW path? There is a case for AFAB as being RP but not RPW, but  I do not think that an AFBB strategy is ever RP. This comment is so long so check out the info on this sub or across the manosphere for why AFBB is not RP.

Here are some examples of things that are not RP at all, regardless of how well you understand the risks - being a female dom in a bdsm relationship, being the head of the relationship as a woman outside of a bdsm context, having a harem of men (or women), sleeping with people indiscriminately. 

All of this is leading up to say that I strongly disagree with this:

> ""you should do whatever you judge best, but here are the positive and negative consequences associated with each decision...understanding those is RP and then beyond that your decision is your own and I don't really care to tell you what to do.""

And hopefully you can see why now that I laid it out? Simply understanding the pros and cons doesn’t make something RP. ",1,RedPillWives
