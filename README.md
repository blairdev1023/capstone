# Blair Thurman's Capstone Project

My project aims at creating a webpage that allows you to enter a reddit username and that webpage will return the probabilities that this person is associated with certain 'right-wing' groups of varying extremity. The ultimate goal is to find a way to pinpoint if someone could be considered a 'radical' (folks of the same philosophy as the UNABOMBER, Timothy McVeigh, praising Waco & Ruby Ridge, etc...). The MVP is simply a clustering and studying of groups that I have found on reddit that I think would be interesting to research.

Links! One really awesome website I found was [SnoopSnoo](https://snoopsnoo.com/). This is essentially a more generalized and expanded scope version of what I want to do. In fact since finding it two days ago I've started borrowing ideas for future exploration in my project. To test this website out I implore you to try it on this user /u/Freedom1092016 (enter it without the '/u/'). I think the word cloud on the bottom, along with the subreddit diagram they post in will easily show you what this account's agenda is.

There are several [Github Repos](https://snoopsnoo.com/about/) for SnoopSnoo that I will likely salivate over for the next 2 weeks. Some on text processing, hosting the page, and some D3 stuff! (Probably won't touch the D3 stuff)
